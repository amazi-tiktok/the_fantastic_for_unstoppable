It was stunning to hear this as the battery was replaced just last month from O'Reilly auto, who kindly accepted to replace the battery. Shay called back upset asking to authorize $50 charge to \u201cspray the brand-new battery with sealant\u201d to prevent it from corrosion and breaking down again. miss Becky at O'Reilly auto called and told me that Shay was a liar as she tested the old battery (which Shay claimed to be broker and wanted to replace). Shay ended up charging the amount of the battery anyhow.\nShay seems to be trained to scam as his boss, Kyle shamelessly stood by the scam and endorsed it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a432fea5a1821:0x88d2d8ec001e2cc6"}

I brought the car back in on Monday the 4th and told them the service engine light came on and something under the car was rattling. I was told by the owners son that he didnt know anything about standard shift cars and they would not be responsible for anything wrong with it. Almost 3 weeks later the car starts running hot. When my husband got to me to check it out he opened up the radiator to find that it is full of J.B block seal he runs over 80 gallons of water through the radiator trying to clean it out to no avail. We replaced the thermostat that was so coroded with block seal it was rusted up. I called and left a message with Pierce auto sales telling them that the car was running hot and because someone was trying to cover up a cracked block or blown head gasket and there was so much block seal in the radiator and engine that I didn't know if the car was going to make it home and that I really needed someone to call me back because I had no way to get it home. I never recieved a call back.It cost me $60 to rent a car dolly to drag it home. Now the car came with an outside warranty but because \"whoever\" filled the motor up with block seal to hide a major problem until they could find an idiot \"me\" to take the car off of there hands the warranty will not cover the car. So now I have a blown up car sitting in my yard that I drove less then a month and repo men knocking on my door because they want there car back and still after all this time I have yet to recieve a call from anyone at Pierce Auto Sales.  I recieved more help and sympathy from the repo man in 10 minutes then I have from Pierce in 2 months. I paid $1500 down for a car that didn't even last until the first payment was due. I dont bash people or businesses but i have tried every other way to get them to talk to me. I just want my money back so I can get a car that runs and won't leave me on the side of the road less then a month after purchase.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a56497104639d:0x842e60c3c94517bb"}

The experience with Auto X was so stress free and comforting that my wife slept in our new car all the way to the baseball tournament.  I would proudly recommend Auto X to all my friends and family.   Thank you Frank and Leslie for helping my family.

MGM told him to take it there. This was a month ago and the car has been parked since. Luckily he has a motorcycle he could use to get back and forth to work, although the weather has not been kind to him in Pensacola where he is stationed. This put him at risk on a daily basis. He did not want to drive the car until MGM advised him what to do at that point. Car is still sitting at this point. He had to get another loan to purchase an engine and get the car repaired.

We only considered a \"No CreditCheck\" dealer because my mom couldn't get approved due to signing on a vehicle for a family member who didn't fulfill their credit agreement. We were told by the salesman named Austin that we only needed proof of income and a valid driver's license. First my mom was declined due to insufficient income so I agreed to be her co-signer. After giving Austin all of my information, including proving income and place of residence, he told us to give him 20- 30 minutes to get a response back from corporate. We returned to the dealership appropriately 40 minutes later feeling hopeful that my mom would get a car. We sat at Austin's desk and he told us that we couldn't be approved because we didn't live together! I've never heard of anything like this before! We wasted two hours of our time while they concocted up a lie for why they couldn't approve us! It was very hurtful and embarrassing! It took a lot for me to even go into a place like that but I trusted them and swallowed my pride just to help my mom. They advertise \"No CreditCheck\" but it's a lie! They looked on her credit bureau and saw the repossessed vehicle and turned her down without even giving her a chance to explain. I will be making a formal complaint with their corporate office on Monday morning! Please don't fall for the \" No CreditCheck Scam\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889243ca50c9c77:0xc15872dadd637371"}

But Kyle Said nothings wrong with the car you can take it anywhere to get it checked out which we should of but hey with this pandemic an money be so close these day who has extra money to spend especially when all three parents had to save up money to buy the daughter her first car. An just think for a daughter to be getting her first car it\u2019s to be exciting joyful an a memory that you you always remember. Well the word of Kyle of the car having nothing wrong with it an it\u2019s a Great first car for our daughter. Well this is Definitely a memory our daughter will not forget. The car is been in my shop for the last four days waiting to be worked on this weekend. So with that being said I hope to warn anyone that is going to buy here be Cautious an don\u2019t trust there word cause it has no meaning whatsoever. An by the way I made several calls an Kyle was out asked for him to call back an nothing.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bac474a36fd59:0xebcd61d634c3788b"}

The young lady got herself out of the car and refused to go to the hospital. she had only very minor injuries. Then on 05-09-2016 my youngest son was involved in a bad one. My 2015 Kia Soul was totaled by a speeding driver. In both of these vehicles \"ALL\" of the airbags were deployed. Thanks to the hand of an Almighty God!!! and the quality of the Kia Soul my son walked away with only slight bruising. Now let me introduce you to the place to go and the man to see to get yours. If you need a sound and dependable vehicle at the right price that will keep you and your loved ones safe. Come to Carlock Kia in Tuscaloosa Alabama. Then see the only man  you'll need to make it happen. His name is Ansharn Glenn aka \" THE CAR DOCTOR\". This man!!!!!! He can make it happen and will without a doubt. He turns frowns upside down:-).

I was looking to build my credit and I had put $8,000 down on a used car with only 51,000 miles I found at Carlock on May 12. I test drove the car and l wanted it on a condition that they do an alignment on it as it had small pull to left.  After 5 hours of doing paperwork I go to get in the car and it wouldn't start due to a crouded battery. They said they would fix it first thing in the morning and gave me a loaner til then. Next day I go to get the car and drive it home, later that evening it wouldn't start. I looked under the hood and it was the same battery with acid everywhere. They had to come haul it back to the car lot. They replaced the battery like they should have done the day before. But now I didn't trust the service department so I took my car to postles tire barn and had them to check and see it had been anligned. In fact it had not, I got a print out of the degree each axle was off alignment. On June 10th I drove to Dallas Texas for one night, on the way back my air compressor quits working. Now I'm over 6 hours away from home and wasn't even out of Texas yet and its about 100 degrees outside. It was a long hot miserable drive home in my new car that I had not even had a month yet nor had I even made my first car payment. I immediately texted my car sales rep, he said bring it in and they will fix it. I was relieved until I actually took it there and they gave me a estimate of $1200 or something in that price range. I had a sit down talk with a general manager and the told me he would have it fixed if I pay for the compressor and Freon which would run me about $350. I don't have an extra any amount because I had just bought that car and had to get full coverage insurance plus tags. And I still have my first car note coming up. If they were as reputable as they claim they would have just fixed it since I hadn't had the car an entire month. I posted pictures of my text messages where I asked them to do the front end alignment and they didn't, I also posted the text convo on how they said to bring my car in and they would fix it. These images are posted on Google just tap on my profile.\nUpdate: its now June 19th and I was told by the Carlock place it was my compressor, I had it replaced somewhere else and that wasn't the problem, so now its taking more money to chase the problem. My first payment is due on the 26th and I haven't been able to drive my car going on two weeks now.\nUpdate: 6/23/17 found out the car needs a whole new air compressor, air condenser, expansion valve, and a vac and recharge which runs 1,700 dollars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8886020b5af1aac5:0xcf8d1db117201b"}

They were over priced compared to other dealers, and the service department is terrible. For instance, I had my oil changed and they did an inspection that is routine. They gave me the sheet showing everything they had checked, to include the tread on my tires. A couple of weeks after this inspection and maintenance my tire almost blew out. It was in terrible condition for some unknown reason with no blame attributed to them because yeah it happens. They told me they could have me a new tire in 24 hrs. So, I agreed. They also added that it would be in my best interest to replace all four tires because the rest of them were in such terrible condition as well. Now, why would they have checked the tread on my tires less than two weeks prior and marked them good if they were in terrible condition?? So, I obliged and told them I would just order four new tires. But, I also told them I wanted to keep the old ones just in case I needed a spare. When I came back to pick up my car it did have new tires. I asked where I could pick up the old ones because my fiance at the time told me to keep them, and they assured me that I didn't want them. One guy, I'm guessing the supervisor, even included that his wife wouldn't be driving around on tires in that bad of shape. So, lesson learned: they will try and take advantage of you in any way they can when it comes to getting the most money out of you. I left without my old tires and to top it all off they even charged me a recycling fee for them after I told them I wanted to keep them. I went back not too long ago and the service was just the same. My AC had went out on this same car. Long story short, they charged me a diagnostic fee and couldn't even tell me exactly what was wrong, but worse case scenario I was looking at $2000 worth of repairs. So, after the tire incident I went elsewhere and got a second opinion. They took less time and narrowed the issue down to a relay problem. But, told me worse case scenario $1500. So, again they are over priced. I ended up trading my car in at a dealership in Bay minette and I couldn't be happier. I purchased the extended warranty on the rogue with them, and it served no purpose. It ran out at 100,000 miles and every issue i had either wasn't covered  or started at 104,000 miles. Another lesson learned. I will not shop with them again, or use their service department for anything to include routine maintenance. I don't recommend them to anyone. Of course this is just my opinion of them from what I experienced.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889aca479d1fc0cd:0x50e17575c246f828"}

They try to help you with any maintenence issues that you may have with your vehicle. You can always pay your notes on time via Internet or go in person. If you are on a budget and you need a decent car, then I'd recommend going to autonet. Just examine the car, as throughly as possible. Keep in mind, with any used car dealership, you must look at what you get before you close out a deal.

Anyway the only way they will help is if I tow it to a guy that they use, which works at the city dump. The same guy who supposedly rebuilt it already. Well I live over a hour away and to tow it there would cost $400. So I called to get them to pay for the tow but no they wouldn't do that.

We made sure of this prior to going, as it is a bit of a drive. When we arrived, they had myseteriously lost our information and the quote they had just referenced on a call the day before from the manager. We refilled out everything, and suddenly the quote was $43k instead of the $38k we were offered previously and told over the phone they would honor. When I called them on the discrepancy, they suddenly started saying that the quote had been on a used Titan, even though they didn't have any used Titans on the lot, and we had driven and looked at four different new ones. The manager on duty (different from the one I had talked to multiple times on the phone), talked down to us and said it was a \"misunderstanding\". We presented the facts, but the manager blew us off, so we walked out.

I called Serra on Dec 12, 2015 to inquire about a car on their website.  It seemed like an awesome price.  However, I didn't want to drive to Sylacauga from Cullman without more info. The dealer I spoke to proceeded (as expected) to sell me a new car rather than the used one I called about.  He finally said he would go to the used lot across the street to check on the car I called about.  He called me back and said they haven't ever had the car that I called about and that their internet guy makes lots of mistakes.  I checked the internet today (Dec 15) and the car is still listed. Instead of the well priced $15999, it is now listed at a more logical $19900.  I don't appreciate being told a lie.  I would have probably bought the car Saturday at the advertised price.  I would have even appreciated being told the appropriate price more than being told a lie.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88895711af6bf395:0xf85e7c23a42a1fcc"}

I felt like he hadn\u2019t even seen an Alfa Romeo vehicle in person. They had nothing in stock to test drive. I ended up going to Birmingham where the knowledgeable staff had six pre-owned Stelvio SUVs I was able to look at and test drive, with more coming in, and a few new dozen cars/SUVs on the lot to choose from, too.

The car had 0% oil life! Once I did that I needed a new water pump , Also I soon discovered  my 2014 Chevy Cruze had a oil leak as well..\nthen the thermostat went out , I had to replace the battery all out these things came of my pocket with in 2 months of having the car\nalso while maintaining my car note and car insurance I\u2019ve never been late or missed any payments due to the fact I work to pay these bills. I\u2019ve only had the car 5 months and here goes the motor just gone out..\n\nwhen we recall all the problems this car had and I was fixing it every time something happen the mechanic and I agreed that it\u2019s been a problem with the motor he also told me Chevy Cruze\u2019s had a recall on their motor!!\nThe dealership never told me this! The mechanic did , now here iam 2 week later without a car , a rental , no communication from the dealership or warranty company just nothing I\u2019m paying to get my car looked at  I\u2019m missing work and I have to do everything alone every time I call GENE HE TELLS ME TO CALL TROY!! Finally I called TROY just wanting to get help with my car getting fixed by this 2 year warranty i supposed to have  because once I sent it to real good mechanic they told him I didn\u2019t have a warranty!! That  I was supposed to have & they don\u2019t know anything!! I had to find the warranty number alone and when I get Troy on the phone he\u2019s \u201csick with COVID-19\u201d so I guess that means hang up in my face because he\u2019s not feeling well BUT NEITHER AM I!! I\u2019m a 21 year old women who pays her bills on time and have to get to work!!  I really need my car due to me having two jobs and was responsible for getting myself to work.

I should start off by saying they did sell the vehicle \"as-is\" but when you purchase from a dealer I believe there is an assumption that what you are purchasing will be somewhat reliable.\nOn the way home from the dealership (Day 1) we were sitting in a drive-thru at idle and noticed the car would shake violently until we either moved or placed the car in neutral.\nDay 2 my wife was on her way to work and noticed the brakes were squealing.\nThis is where things get \"interesting\". We were told by King to take it to a local Jeep dealer to get a safety recall issue sorted out. When I came to pick up the Jeep, the service department manager at our local dealership (NOT King) came to speak to me and said there were several issues with the car and he \"did not understand how the vehicle passed any inspection to be sold\". So of course, this alarmed me and I asked him what all he found. He said that all 4 motor mounts needed to be replaced, the rear brakes were shot, and the rear wheel cylinders were visibly leaking oil. He gave a repair estimate of $1600. On a vehicle that, to us, was less than 2 weeks old at the time.\nSo, I called the dealership who after 3 phone calls finally got back to me and said they were sorry for the inconvenience and I should be expecting a call from the used dealer manager and my salesman within the hour. Fast forward 2 days later, I get a call from a manager who says there is no way he can guarantee they will cover the repair but if I want to drive the car back to them and wait on the service department that maybe it would be something they would take care of IF \"they felt like it was something they missed\" and that I would hear from my salesman to schedule a service date within an hour. Again, a couple days later I get a call from the salesman who says the dealership has decided not to look at the car and that they would not cover any repair.\n*So, bottom line, I would NOT recommend King Valley as a dealership. Do not expect ANY reliability from their used cars because even they do not. I was told \"we expect vehicles with over 100K miles to have some trouble\".

Greg Johnson, my salesman, was not pushy.  I first met Greg back in August 2017, when I  was shopping around between three different name brand SUVs.  I currently had a 2011 Toyota Venza.  I have always been loyal to Toyota products.  Ranging from SR5 hatchback, corolla,, 2 camry\u2019s, highlander, and my Venza.  The Venza was nice and was very comfortable; But since Toyota didn\u2019t make the Venza any more, my husband recommended that I try looking at the Lincoln MKX.  I had done my research and knew exactly what I wanted on my new vehicle.  I googled Lincoln dealerships close to my house, and King Ford Lincoln dealership located in Valley, Alabama popped up.  My daddy had always helped me with dickering for a good price,  but still leaving room for the dealership to still make some money ( all without breaking my pocket book).  My daddy passed away in 2011 and this was the first time I had to put all that knowledge to use that my daddy taught me.  So off I go, to Valley, AL.  I pulled up to King Ford Lincoln and started walking the lot.  Greg Johnson came up to me and asked if I had any questions, which I did.  I was looking for a Lincoln MKX with very specific options.  He only had one on the lot and it had just been pulled off the delivery truck.  He went and got the keys and off we go on a test ride.  I sat in the drivers seat, and immediately feel in love with the way the seats hugged my back.  When you start getting older, you are looking for comfort.  This vehicle outshined the other two brands that I had been considering.  I told Greg that I wanted to think about it and I would get back with him.  I really wanted to see if he was going to be blowing up my phone in pushing me to buy.  That was not the case.  After three days, of constant consideration, I called him back and asked if the vehicle was still available.  I\u2019m so glad it was.  I headed back to Valley, AL and started talking price.  The sales team was so friendly, and really worked hard to get me multiple incentives and a great trade in price and still be Able to walk away with both arms and legs.  I was so pleased with the service and friendly staff, that when my husband said he was ready for a new Ford F-150 truck, instead of going to our local Ford dealership in Columbus, GA, we went back to King Ford.  While looking at several trucks with Greg Johnson, The sales manager, Jimmy Scroggins, walked up and he recognized me from my purchase 7 months ago and could tell me what I bought, as well as, what I traded in.  I was impressed.  Again the sales staff went over and above to find my husband the exact truck he was looking for.  I was in and out  of the dealership still feeling great about my purchase and the new friends I made at King Ford that I now consider family.  Thank you Greg, Kevin, Jimmy, and Mr. Porter, for a great experience at King For Lincoln.  I highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new vehicle.  They truly treat you like family.\n\nTeresa Randle", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1520608134462, "text": "Teresa thank you so much for the wonderful review, I will make sure the guys see this.

I took the car back to first class the mechanic stated they had to order a part and that because the car is controlled by sensors that is why the car was saying it was over heated. Reminder this car supposedly past a inspection. The car was smoking I called and advised the company they stated oh because you just got a new part it probably just some old oil burning it\u2019s fine. Last month the car ran hot again I called the company and was told someone would call me back no call was ever made I put coolant in it and it seemed ok. The car ran hot again so I called first class again they stated they had no messages or they didn\u2019t see where I called(the woman was the same person I left a message with a month ago) because I was getting a oil change at pep boys I asked if they could tell me why my car was running hot they did a diagnostic test and first class stated pep boys is not covered under the warranty no problem I just needed to take it to a place that was covered under the warranty I did firestone. Firestone then talk to the warranty company and advised them if their diagnosis and made it urgent that the car be towed to a mechanic shop and requested that company be Chevrolet. The warranty company then had the car towed to Chevrolet. Chevrolet calls and say the warranty company is only covering a certain portion and the out of pocket remaining balance is 400 and some odd dollars reminder this is the same problems that were occurring when I first got the car. The first class is giving me the run around and are very unprofessional. I asked to speak with owner and was told he may be in today he may not but a email will be sent to him and once he responds I will get a call back. I am a single mother of two kids I have not been able to get to work. I gave this company every dollar I had and they are telling me to use use my insurance for a rental or my own money for a rental and get reimbursed. This has been the WORST experience EVER!

I saw the truck online, and went by one weekend afternoon.  They made a copy of my license and let me take the truck for a test drive on my own which was a breath of fresh air because I didn't feel like I was taking up the sales guys' time. Sheila, the manager was very kind and helpful.   When I got back, I got the carfax report without issue.  There was no high pressure sales pitch that I had become used to after looking at lots of trucks over several weeks. I was honest about minor defects I had found on the vehicle and they acknowledged and did not dispute them.  We haggled a bit as is healthy and expected, but I think all parties were satisfied and I know I got a fair price for the vehicle.\n\nI wanted to use my credit union, so had to wait until Monday to take possession, which wasn't a problem. After a handshake, we agreed to meet again on Monday. On Monday, after I got my credit union info, Sheila checked other banks they commonly use just to make sure I was getting the best deal on my loan.   The truck was cleaned and ready to go, and they had all my paperwork ready to sign.  We exchanged a check for keys and I was out of there in less than 30 minutes.\n\nIt has been a little over a month and I am so far very satisfied with my vehicle, and I would definitely consider doing business with Montevallo imports again.\n\nSince I haven't had a problem, I can't give a full 5 stars since I can't know how they would handle any weird thing that might come up. With that said, I got a great vehicle at a great price without any hassle, so I can't complain.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553623557335, "text": "Thank you, Andrew!

The car was overpriced based off of the car fax report. The car as well had several cosmetic issues. When we asked to hear the engine, the car would not start. This leads me to believe that they do not crank their cars on a regular basis and have them sitting there. After 20 minutes of jumping the car off, I asked if the cup holder could be replaced, since the car was priced well over 20k. Her response was it will just peel off again.

I live about an hour and a half away so I really love it!  I did all my negotiating via email and set up a test drive appointment. Very, very, easy sale for the company. My biggest disappointment is the fact that the car was filthy when I arrived and the battery terminals were severely corroded. I am convinced nobody from the service department even looked under the hood until I made them.  I wanted the terminals cleaned,  I wanted an oil change,  all fluids topped off and a cabin air filter change (Very minimal requests for a car dealership) I stated it would have to be detailed inside. The detail department worked on it but they would only be there until 12 or 12:30. So we concluded our business (paid cash) and I went to lunch without the car.  Well by the time I got back the headliner was much cleaner but it smelled terribly in the car (like stagnant mop water). Nothing else was even wiped down and unfortunately the detail department was gone. There was sticky crusted disgusting something in all the buttons so some would stick in certain positions. Literally the battery terminal was only brushed with a wire brush to knock off the corrosion. I don't think the oil was changed. When I got home the oil did not appear new. I think they put new on top of the old then they mixed together. The cabin air filter was not changed. I removed it to check because everytime I used recirculated air instead of fresh it smelled bad. It has a new one now and it no longer has an odor.\n\nMy salesman was okay, but seriously the easiest commission ever. Wish I would have at least gotten an after the sale phone call. Just to check in. Would have made me feel better about the other issues.\n\nMy complaints are only directed to the service and detail departments.\n\nI am now looking for a truck in the $20,000 range (same as my Maxima) and I am not even looking at this company now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb264d8d2482b:0xf6be7f6160faedaf"}

The salesman walked up to me try to find out what was going on. She began to butt in, so then the gentleman walked me out the door to discuss it. it started to rain, he offered to grab an umbrella for me.

When I went there I went to my niece salesman and told him what I was looking for and what I wanted and I had a trade in. Everything that I wanted it was always a problem with what the financial department would finance he kept saying. I wanted a 2011 or 2012 Toyota Avalon or a 2 door 2013 Honda accord. The salesman kept trying to put me in 2015 or 2016 vehicle and that wasn't what I wanted. The salesman was real pushy and not at all patient. I left from there with a 2016 Camry, the same one he threw in my face as the 1st car I drove even though I told him I hated those Camry. In the end he wound up giving me a car i absolutely hate. He made sure he got a good commission off of me, in spite of what I told him I like and wanted. I will take my other family members to another car lot instead of this one. So now I'm going to go to my father, God mother, God sisters, sisters, and lil brother and God daddy, who are all ministers, and plead with God to reverse this curse that was done to me and make a way out of no way to get the car I want. This is so sad and disgusting to be taken advantage of like this.

He and I sat while they took care of the issue and I found him to be very astute about all sorts of subjects regarding cars and how financing works. He took time with me he did not have to take. He also made it possible that the car that i wanted was serviced before I left in it a few hours later. I cant say enough about this salesman, and also about the sales manager, a Mr. Joe. The Dealership as a whole was easy to deal with and Billy and Joe were actually able to get me out the door $500 less than the advertised price.

So not only did they try to overcharge me, they didn't even properly complete the work they did. The owner was sketchy throughout the whole deal. I had to repeatedly ask for quotes, which he never gave me solid estimates on, and I never felt like I could trust the work they did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e0c85d13b3:0x4f1f235ee3e07b59"}

We bought a 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe(with around 29,000 miles and some warranty left on it) from them that had been wrecked...twice. Even though this was on the car fax, this information was not disclosed to us. We hear a noise in the rear of the vehicle, so we took it to a local Chevrolet dealership. We were told that the vehicle had been wrecked, not fixed completely, and unsafe for my children and myself to be traveling in. We were advised to contact the dealer first and give them the opportunity to make it right. Sport Center Imports wanted us to bring them the vehicle and let them have another Chevrolet dealer take a look at it. We were given a vehicle to drive and was under the impression that they were going to do everything they could to make it \"right\". We sought legal advise. We were advised not to accept the vehicle after they had their mechanics look at it, but give them two options... either find us one that was comparable, or buy it back from us. About a week later, one of the owners contacted us to let us know the Tahoe was fixed...it was just a coil spring that needed to be repaired.  Once we explained that we did NOT want this Tahoe, and this was not we had paid all this money for, we were told they would find us one comparable. So once again, we were under the impression they were going to make it right. When they found us another one, it had over 36,000 miles which meant no warranty....BUT we decided to go ahead and purchase it and put it all behind us (after having it looked at by our own mechanics). They agreed to pay the first one off (as a trade-in), and turn around and finance the second one. They did. However,  a couple weeks later, we got a call from the owner letting us know that a payment was late on the first Tahoe (that we traded back in to them BEFORE the first payment was due) and that he didn't want it to damage our credit. We needed to pay it and he would pay the rest of the Tahoe off. Once again, we had to threaten to get a lawyer. We had to contact the credit union to explain what was happening and that we didn't want our credit ruined. It has been a long, drawn out mess! Instead of doing the right thing to begin with, we had to continuously fight with these people to get anything done.

Our budget was limited indeed, but I was expecting that a mazda mpv with almost 200k at $2800 to be working just fine at least for a while, especially when you GET IT FROM A DEALER. We took it for a drive test, and nothing seemed wrong with it. The mechanic they have it on site, looked at it and said the car was just fine. We explicitly told the salesperson that we need a CAR THAT RUNS AND DRIVES WELL. About 10 minutes after I left the dealer,  the power steering started to act very weird , becoming very hard to keep the car straight. At any moment I could've make an accident or worse. We took it to a shop, and we were told that we need to invest at least $4000 to fix just the problem with the power steering, let alone the other problems with the engine that appeared after. I don't know if someone from the dealership turned the check engine light off, but the guys at the shop discovered at least 5 check engine codes. Moreover, when the time came to go to DMV and get it registered, they tried to bypass the law and make me pay the whole registration fee(the fee was supposed to be included in the car price)  saying that \" I have a Georgia driver's license\" and they can't do anything about it\". I called the salesperson back  within 5 days of the car purchase,  and I was told that the car was sold \"AS-IS\". Dear friends, BEWARE of this place.

I sent my car that was under warranty to Chatom Ford. That was one of my worst mistakes possible. The first week of their service was promising. After that it was all down hill. Shade the \u201cService Manager\u201d was my main point of contact. He would promise me updates and call backs which I would never get a returning call. On October 16th I was PROMISED my car was repaired and ready for pick up. As I had two friends take off work to take me 5.5 hours to Chatom Ford, Shade called me and said \u201cthe car jumped time and is not ready\u201d. The following day I called to get the new date  I could expect my car to be repaired.  Shade then tells me that he had been lying to me and my car was not ready and he does not know why my car is not fixed nor when it could be fixed. During this call he also promised me that the car would be sent to my house in Tennessee. After Shade continued to lie about my car and repairing it, I then moved to speaking with Collin Ward (General Manager)-  I only spoke with him once because he told me \u201c I\u2019m sure what you are saying MAY have happened, but im sure my team has a better way of going about this story\u201d. He also promised I would get a call back from him and I never did. Collin also asked me why I would even send my car here with it being out of state and not send it local (I was on my way back from vacation on the coast when it happened). In my opinion, this should not matter. With no hope, I called asking for the owner, Gene Brown. No one would help me reach him. Then I finally received a call from Kevin O\u2019Brien. He was very promising and reassuring at first as they all were. Kevin worked with my father and I for about two weeks then he stated to not take our calls or call us back as promised. Last, my father began to work with Lara. She was helpful in helping us know what was going on. She is who we worked with for the rest of this mayhem. 99 days later on December 18th Chatom Ford met me in Mississippi to give me my car. This dealership is an ACTUAL JOKE. From day one I asked for nothing but updates and I never once got that. NOT ONE WORKER AT THIS PLACE (I say place because I can not call this a business because this place has no business structure at all.) was truthful in customer service to my father or myself. If anyone at this place has any further questions feel free to contact me as you have my name and number. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME BY NOT SENDING YOUR CAR HERE. THIS MANAGEMENT IS A JOKE AND ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS IN THEIR PROFESSION.\nThank you for the worst Ford experience I could ever ask for.

It's like you almost have to stand in the middle of the floor and yell \" CAN I GET SOME HELP IN HERE PLEASE!!!\". Staff in the service department will just sit behind their little desks and won't even acknowledge that you are in there until you get right in their face and tell them you need service. Maybe they are trained to be that way because customer service is only as good as the people who manage and run the company. Dreadfully, when your vehicle goes to the back to be serviced, be prepared bring breakfast, lunch and dinner with you because you're stuck and at the mercy of Jim Burke service department. I had a staff member to tell me it will take about an hour and a half for an oil change and it turned to three and a half hours. I asked a staff member how long before my vehicle is finished in two hours. The staff member check and he told me it was still on the rack. At the last service appointment, my vehicle sat on the street when they finished with the doors unlocked for I don't know how long after service and I had to hunt down a staff member to get my keys. No one came to the waiting room to let me know my vehicle was ready. And that side of town in Birmingham has vehicles broken into all the time. So let me end this rant by saying there needs to be some checks and balances of the staff at Jim Burke service department because customer service is little to none there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8c12068ef7:0x6f980372d2b288cd"}

I had a flat tire on a Friday afternoon so I called Jim Burke right away thinking they could help me. When I called, I asked them if they have the tire in stock and when they could get me in but the guy on the phone kept saying \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d, \u201c I might have to order it\u201d \u201cmaybe you could come in...\u201d. I asked him if he could check his inventory because I really needed my car for work Monday. He told me to call back the next morning. I re-explained to him that I really needed to figure this out because I drive for work and needed my car situated by Monday.\nI called Saturday morning - he said they didn\u2019t have the tire in stock and they\u2019d have to order it. Then he asked me repeatedly what tire I had and I told him multiple times what was written on the tire. He called back several more times to confirm what the tire was. Then he said he didn\u2019t know when the tire would be in, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday.\nI called Monday morning to see if they had any update on when the tire would come in but the service department didn\u2019t answer. Then I called someone that I had been in contact with in the leasing department. They tried to get a hold of someone in service. By the end of the day the only thing they could tell me is that they didn\u2019t know when the tire would be in because the guy who helped me Saturday was not in. I emphasized that I really needed my car for work and that I\u2019d been driving on a spare. They said they\u2019d  probably have a loaner car to give me on Tuesday but they\u2019d have to get back with me in the morning.\nTuesday - I heard nothing all day. No updates about my tire. Heard nothing back about the loaner. Finally I called someone in the leasing department again around 3 and they said \u201cno ones called you yet??\u201d\nBy the time the guy finally got back with me he said he hasn\u2019t been able to locate the loaner that it \u201cdisappeared\u201d, he didn\u2019t know why so many people were involved in this, and that the tire was still not in and he didn\u2019t know when it would come.  I told him that I was frustrated and I needed either a tire or a loaner. He said if he would have known this Friday he would have given me a loaner............\n\nWednesday morning I was finally able to pick up a loaner car and then my tire came in and I picked up my car Thursday.\n\nNot sure why I had to chase down this guy. He couldn\u2019t tell me straight whether they carried the tire on the car that I leased from them. And his problem solving skills were just not there.

As far as people coming in and out either ahead or after you it is difficult to comment as to why because we offer multiple services through multiple auto manufactures that have quick service options like Oil changes, filter replacements, etc. Your vehicle was in for an electrical diagnosis which can take more time. It appears that there was an issue with the wiring harness, which was repaired, also a possibility of another issue with the third brake light that would have resulted from the wiring harness short. When the third brake light was tested at the time of service it tested good, but had symptoms that could result in a possible failure in the future. However, we could not definitively say that it had failed and wouldn\u2019t want to sell anything that is not needed. The estimate that was provided on your receipt was discounted to absorb the labor cost in the event it did fail at a later date keeping you from paying double labor. As far as contacting you when the vehicle was completed it is our practice to stay in constant contact as discussed with the customer and to contact once the vehicle is complete. We do not show the specifics as to when you were contacted but do have that the vehicle was completed around 12:00 p.m. If you were not contacted promptly or at all when the vehicle was completed we will address that directly with the advisor that assisted you. Again we apologize that you received less than an ideal service visit. We hope that you can give us the opportunity to make your future visits much better.\""}, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8c12068ef7:0x6f980372d2b288cd"}

I made a visit on 01/09/17. I recently totaled a 2016 Nissan Altima SV, so getting another vehicle ASAP was of importance as I only had my rental car until 01/12/16. He did not waste my time. He asked what were my top 3 cars, my wants, what I didn't want, car note range and down payment amount. He ran with it from there.  He did above and beyond my expectations, and I will be a repeat customer of Terry Skinner and refer my friends and family. He was able to put me in a 2015 Nissan Altima 3.5 SL, and you wouldn't believe it if I told you how much I am saving monthly as my car not was almost cut in half.

We are not newbies at Jim Burke.  Actually we vowed to never do business with them again due to an experience in the Nissan new car department we had in 2013.  The agent we initially dealt with was not thorough and didn't really seem to be interested in satisfying us, but instead wanted to just sell a car. My husband knew what he was looking for. The only reason we purchased the car was because it was exactly what I wanted.  Leading up to my retirement,  my husband,  Mike wanted to surprise me with my dream car which was an infinity Q50. Just so happened,  he observed the vehicle on the internet. Now from my understanding,  he wasn't looking to get it from them but more so wanted to see how the agents intentions for their customers' would be like. He made communication with Mr. JONT\u00c9 WILLIAMS.  Well apparently Mr. Williams knows how to deal with hard rock minds like my husband.  Mike is a straight up business man who looks for people to hang themselves once he's had bad experiences with them but this was the case. Jont\u00e9 was very professional but also displayed a great people oriented level of customer relation and appreciation.  Mike told me that Jont\u00e9 was not pushy and that he was all about making sure I was happy with my retirement gift. When my husband told me what was going on, I did everything I could to make it known that I didn't want to go over there but when my husband said he was working with Jim Burke again,  I  knew it had to be ok. Well upon actually meeting Mr. Williams, I  observed him to be a very confident man in his spirit.  He is very comfortable with people such as my husband and when I saw them laughing and talking,  I  knew he, Mr. Williams, was trustworthy of giving our time and business to him. Jont\u00e9 relating to me reminded me of a non paternal big brother I have. He kept me laughing but at the same time he took the time to make sure that I was comfortable with the decision to accept the infinity Q50. Dont\u00e9 really took care of us and put our mindset at ease when it came to purchasing future vehicles from Jim Burke. We would defiantly refer others to your business. Thank you Jont\u00e9 for your professionalism,  and I look forward to seeing you again.\n\nTracy McCall and Michael McCall", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1465313515714, "text": "Thank you for sharing your positive experience with us!

I told the big dealer across the street I was looking for a low rate with a payment no more than 300 a month.   The best they said they could do was 17% and 400 mo. For a car I didnt like.  I told them my past rates had been about 6%. They actually laughed and said that wasn't going to happen since I haven't used my credit in 3 years and that I was basically a ghost. Adam rue had the perfect car that i absolutely  love, got me a 6.57% rate and 289 monthly pymt. Thanks to you I now have credit in my new name.  You gave it your all, above and beyond. I was more that just a high money making rate.  You have been a blessing and have made a life time customer which is worth more than 17%.\nThank you, God bless", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4f22b70954e3:0x9b534d38f5f43b72"}

People write bad reviews for reason. I saw all of the great reviews here and I figured that this would be a decent place to purchase a vehicle for rebuilding credit. However, I was wrong. All of the bad reviews here are accurate. I've even waited 9 days to post this review because I didn't want to do it out of anger. I wanted to make sure that I am not in my emotions and being fair about what I am saying. I do not take any pleasure in writing this bad review.\n\nI was strung along from this company for 18 days. I needed a vehicle because I had just come in town from across the country. These people claimed that I was going to put down $1200 for a 2006 Escalade. I never said that I was going to put down that much. I also have a call recorder app on my phone that records EVERY CALL. I went back and reviewed those calls and never in any of those audio's did I ever say that I was going to put down that much. As a matter of fact, I asked Jennifer specifically, \"About how much are my payments going to be?\" The only thing that was discussed was that it would be $175 every 2 weeks.\n\nThey went ahead \"processed\" My application. Jennifer came back and let me know that I was approved. However, the vehicle had several different issues that they needed to fix. Jennifer told me that it had to be put in the shop and that they didn't want me to have it in that condition. At the same time other customers, that had already purchased vehicles from this dealership, were bringing cars back because they were having issues with them. This was a major red flag for me. I kept getting put to the back burner because other people were bringing their cars back that they purchased from there, that needed to be fixed. I said that twice y'all. Think about that.\n\nIn the meantime, I didn't have a car and needed to get around. I asked Jennifer for a loaner, and she said they were \"reluctant\" to give me one because I'd be expecting that level of service all the time. But they wanted to get my business, so they provided me with an ugly Kia. It was ugly, but at least I could get to Walmart, ya know?\n\nThey finally got the Escalade fixed and ready by July 10th. Dave called me and let me know that it was ready. I drove the ugly Kia back to them. When I got there, I test drove the Escalade. I didn't like how bad the inside looked, but it's a 2006. There's obviously going to be a lot of wear and tear. Tracy asked me how much I was going to put down? I told her $500. She told me that Jennifer told her that we had already discussed the down payment. I told her no, she did not discuss that with me. The only thing that was discussed was the $175 every 2 weeks.\n\nSo of course they went and called Jennifer. And of course, they came back and told me that she said she discussed that with me. They would not be able to accept anything less than $1000. And then very callously, Tracy told Dave, \"Take her home.\" I said, \"Damn, y'all not even trying to work with me?\" Nope. I didn't argue. I just gave them the key back and Dave drove me home apologizing.\n\nI emailed them the audio proving what was said, and got crickets. They were caught in a lie.\n\nLast week, I needed to get to the VA....I am a disabled veteran. It is important that if I need medical care, I have a way to get there so that I can receive what I need. I did not have a vehicle to get my medical care. I don't think these people even thought of how this was going to affect me. But something that I have learned is that if you are constantly being blocked for something, then spiritually, you are being blocked and protected for reason. And I think that I may have dodged a bullet with these people.\n\nSo everyone, please heed this warning. ALL of these bad reviews that are on here are here for a reason. I'm not bashing these people, I'm just stating the facts.\n\nI hope that this never happens to any of them or their loved ones.\n\nPatronize this business at your own risk.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595369908253, "text": "At Credit Now Auto Sales our goal is to provide the highest level of customer service experience.

The phrase \u2018used car salesman\u2019 is seldom used as a compliment, but this is the one place that in all my adult years, I never expected to find. They do everything in their power to work with you. From your budget, to the table, they never rushed us for a sale or pushed us for more money, and have always stood behind their word. There truly is no other dealership in the greater Huntsville area, that compares. Call and ask for Mike, he\u2019s a true standup guy! I am happy to call New Car Auto Sales, MY dealership and I hope you will too.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8248756407:0xecb35d010b2f0fa2"}

I did take it for a quick test drive which was a very easy process. The rep wouldn't do any negotiating or talk any numbers outside and only wanted to do that inside at his desk. I didn't really particularly care for that part and that's where he lost me. IDK maybe that's just their policy? Over all good experience. I didn't buy anything due to current inventory.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1542332563450, "text": "Thank you so much for the kind words!!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a41f61b1221d7:0xc5ad07e02c4bd14f"}

I have fond them to be very understanding when I was sick and had to have surgery, I let them know I could not afford to keep the truck I had they came and picked it up then when I got out of the hospital and was able to return to work they sold me another truck with no down payment.\nJanet has always been understanding if people would call and let her know they were getting behind because of losing a job or some kind of illness. I have always known her to work with people if they gave here the respect of letting her know what was happening.\nThe people I hear talking bad about them are the ones who don't call and move. Or hide their cars then they get mad and badmouth her and the business.I have also noticed most of those people have a history of trying to keep from paying for what they buy from anyone and according to them it is always the business or the people that work there that cause the problem.

Either way, they gave me a note of encouragement that every mom needs sometimes with a gift card for coffee. The second time: I requested a larger loaner vehicle which is apparently hard to come by. Along with my 3 kids, my dad is in a wheelchair and I transport him to/from dialysis and we just all wouldn't fit in the smaller one. They greeted me with a \"one tough cookie\" box with treats and snacks galore.\n\nThey are the nicest people and so accommodating. Add uplifting to that mix.

The rep told me the light costs $500+ and the labor wasnt that much. I started to look up the part online brand new and I could buy 2 for less than what he quoted me. I told him they could stop and I'll bring in the light myself after buying it cheaper elsewhere. He tells me I will still have to pay $135 for the diagnostic. No problem. He comes back and tells me it's already in. I ask well where is my car? He says they're finishing up. 45 minutes later he comes back and tells me that they put a new light in and it didnt work. Must be a wiring issue he said. So I said: \"So that $135 diagnostic u tried to charge me for wasn't even accurate? Because the diagnostic claimed I needed a new light.\" He never did answer. They did change my oil so I paid for my oil change only and went to leave. When I got my car back if was filthy even though they claimed all customers get a complimentary wash with all services.

Things didn't go quite as we had planned. Our SUV was cutting out pretty bad on the highway. It was getting worse the closer we got to Mobile. I contacted my friend who's daughter lives in Mobile to see if she might know of a service place. I talked with her daughter and she informed me that her husband, Kyle, worked for Joe Bullard Cadillac. She gave me the number for the service department and said to speak with Haley.  About this time the check engine light came on in our vehicle. It was flashing on and off, then would stay lit.\nWhen I spoke with Haley in the service department she asked about the service engine light. When I told her it had been flashing intermittently she was immediately concerned and said we should get stopped as quickly as we could to avoid internal engine damage.  She then helped us get started with finding a tow service. We were 50 miles aWay and had four people so their usual towing service couldn't do it, but she got the ball rolling for us. She gave me her direct phone number so I could call if I needed anything.\nOnce we got to the dealership Kyle helped us get a loaner car while ours was being repaired. Haley kept us informed as they learned what was wrong. Our technician, Mike, came in on Saturday to work on our vehicle because we needed to leave to head back to Missouri on Sunday.\nTo make a long story short...God used all of these people to help us during a difficult time. They made this experience so much less stressful than it could've been. THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP US! And, they did it all with a smile.

What I didn't like was that the mechanics were excessively rough with my vehicle. I had to have it towed and the towing company left it at the gate. Christian got me a loaner car, which I appreciated very much. When I picked up the loaner there were 2 guys who were trying to get it started to get it up to the shop. I needed to grab a couple things out of my car so I stopped to do that. For some reason they needed to open the back hatch. I was traveling with my animals so I had a large kennel in the back. I watched them put my seats down (rather roughly) and sling my kennel from the back to atop the back seats. It made me cringe but at this point I needed to get going as I had some stops to make and  I thought surely they knew what they were doing, this is a Cadillac dealership afterall and these cars cost a lot. They will surely be careful... When I got my car back, instead of them putting the vehicle back they way they found it, the kennel was still strown across the back. (As a plus though, it was washed! Which I appreciated since I had been on the road and try to take care of my car!) When I went to move the kennel back in place I noticed that there are scrapes across the plastic sides in the back. Greeeeaaaaaat. But, at that point I was leaving to head back to my home state and couldn't worry about it. It was more important to get home safe. They told me in addition to the battery that I needed new air filters, a rear wiper blade, and the throttle body cleaned, all easy enough for me to do myself. So, now I am here doing said maintenance and when I popped the hood I immediately noticed that my positive battery terminal clip has been broken and won't stay shut. Great. I am now back home, 3 states away. I will be back to the area, and am considering moving my family there but if they don't make this right I will find a different dealership to maintenance at.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517174513045, "text": "Hi Jami,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review and detailed feedback.

It has been solely serviced and maintained by McConnel/Bullard.  It has less than 30,000 miles on the odometer.  It's been the worst car we've owned since our marriage in 1962.  The problem today was a broken window regulator on the rear driver's side.  My wife has been the sole driver of this car.  We have no children in then home.  My conservative guess is that this window has been lowered and raised no more than 10 times in its aborted lifetime.  My wife was told a plastic roller had broken.  A plastic roller in a $50,000 (2004) Cadillac?!  My bill:  $517.23!  I can go back through my invoices and find similar instances of shoddy work and padded bills.  During the second year we owned the car the driver side dash assembly fell off the dash while my wife was driving.  At around the 4-5 year of ownership your service supervisor convinced my wife that she needed to replace all four tires (around 10,000 miles) because they had \"dry-rotted.\" ($800)  I've owned two Cadillac De Ville's prior to this, and have never experienced what has to be either poor construction, low-quality parts, or untruthful service managers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

His extensive knowledge of the vehicle I wanted (XTS) and the history of Cadillac itself impressed me by far. The hospitality didn't stop with Mustafa. Roosevelt Harris also did a fine job answering all the questions I had about the different cars and prices. He also mentioned a couple of nice restaurants we could try out while visiting Atlanta, GA which we did and absolutely loved. Curtis Williams came by and personally greeted us and also had a nice conversation with my fiance. Last, but definitely not least, Jon McCartney was absolutely amazing (and not just because he actually knows where Winnfield, LA is located lol). He worked very hard to get the financing I needed to get the exact vehicle I wanted. It was a hard sale for me, but he showed us that he wouldn't give up. I really appreciated all the time that each of them took out to make our experience the best car buying experience we have had.

We had to wait so long the detail crew had left so we had to bring our car back the next day to get it detailed and floor mats put in because they forgot them in the car. The sales crew had little knowledge of the features of the car. Sandy Sansing name has always represented professionalism to us although in the past we dealt with the Ford dealer in Daphne. This was our first time buying a Nissan as we usually get Fords. Only time will tell if I return to purchase a Nissan but if I do it will not be from the Foley Nissan crew.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597414203702, "text": "We are sorry to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations.

I spoke with her on a Friday afternoon and she asked me to text her information on my trade so she could work up a tentative offer and that she would get back to me that evening or at the latest the next morning.  I sent the info over shortly after our phone conversation and she confirmed via text message she had received the info and would get back with me shortly.  I have not heard from her since.  I sent a text message the following afternoon asking for an update and the next Monday asking if she had any information for me and she never replied.  My husband called and left a voicemail 3 days ago and still has not had a reply.  It is safe to say they lost a sale.  It is common business practice to communicate with your customers. If you are not interest in a trade then be professional enough to say that.  I would have still purchased the truck.

We found one online, previously, and wanted to drive one before we drove all that way to Birmingham to see it. They made us a proposal, \"If we  can cut you a deal on a new one, can we have your business?\" Well, of course if the price is right then, yes. We drive a grey CX-5, everything is great, but they are calling this car \"new\" and it has 7500 miles on it. Well, it's never been owned they say its a \"demo\" car. Then my husband tells them he wants to be at $19,999 financed for this car (yes, we were putting several thousand down - we didn't expect a miracle deal). They only get it down to $20,010. Then he says, well if you throw in remote start, we will take it. They came back with each of us paying half so, we decided to buy the car.\n\nThey told us that they could get us a killer interest rate of less than one percent. When we got back to financing, it was another story entirely. We ended up wit ha 4.99 interest rate because \"less than one percent is only for \"new\" cars\" well when you were trying to negotiate this deal you said it was a new car and now that we are financing you've classified it as a \"used\" car.\n\nAfter we left, we began driving to my dad's house which is probably 100 miles away. The check engine light came on before we got there. We had O'Reily's check the computer and they said it was low oil pressure. We called and they has us call the Mazda tow truck to come pick it up and take it to the nearest Mazda which was in Birmingham. (They told me to get a rental during this time and they would pay me back.) They called for me to come pick it up three or four days later saying it was a computer problem and it was fixed. When we got there, 4 error messages were popping up on the dash. We left the car and called the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda who never called us back and said he never got our message.\n\nI went in to talk to the Julio Jones Mazda sales manager about this problem on Monday. They had me sit there for a while and eventually said they spoke with the technician at the Birmingham Mazda and they said I must have taken my foot off the brake too early and it caused the car to throw up those error messages. So, they blamed me for the problem.\n\nLater, the technician from Birmingham called us personally and said they had screwed up and not fixed it properly to begin with. So, the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda was either misinformed or blatantly lied to make me think it was my fault.\n\nWell, we finally got the car back and it has been running fine. No more issues. However, they still haven't paid me back for the rental and it's been almost a month. I called about this and they said they lost my receipt and asked me for the amount again. I still haven't been paid and they haven't bothered to call me back. That was a week ago.\n\nSimultaneously, I took the car in to the Julio Jones service center to get the remote start put in on a Thursday. They told me it would take a day, maybe two, to get this done. The service center is telling me that I owe our half of the remote start that was supposed to be included in the deal. Obviously, they didn't include it in the price like they said they would. Also, they had to give me a rental car because they couldn't get the remote start to work. It's now Monday and I have no clue when I am going to get my car back. I called today and they said they still couldn't get the remote start to work.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't wish this headache on anyone and I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone.

Turns out the wheel speed sensors where the issue. I call my dealer who advised me to find a dealership that could make the repair... easier said than done. I was told 10-14 days before the service could be performed... until I spoke to Shannon Stull at Century Auto. I briefly defined the situation in hope that the parts and time might be available. In record time Shannon with the cooperation Chris Pope, where able to order overnight the proper parts and squeeze the car in for service. The parts did arrive and the service was performed without issue. I\u2019m sure it was a team effort to make this happen, and thanks to the professionals who actually installed the parts!

We pulled up the part and I left under the impression that the part was being ordered because it was going to take at least two days to arrive. Therefore when the part was scheduled to arrive was the timing I was told my car would be looked at by the technician. Lies lies lies .... I had to keep calling Shannon the manager to find out if there was any information on the arrival of the part ... how much will it cost and never an direct answer. Every time  it was let me call you back and I am about to go follow up. And never return the call/s. After my car was there for a week I called again to only find out the part was not ordered and they were ordering it that day. Which meant at least another two days waiting for the one part that we knew I needed to arrive. The sad thing is this is the only place locally that are certified to work on my car or get parts from. I had to get a rental twice for a week because I never knew when my car would be ready. Extremely Poor Customer Service. Lastly they called me at 4:00 to tell me my car was ready when they close at 5:00 with only an estimate for cost. Never stating that they did not except certain payments.

It checked out- As any used car it had minor things that needed to be addressed but that's to be expected with any used car. I don't expect a brand new car, besides a mechanic shop HAS to give you a long list otherwise they feel like they have not done their job correctly.

They seemed to do well and sold many cars at that location. He was a very down to earth person. The reason for my detailed explanation is to make it clear to anyone that looks at online reviews to take them for a grain of salt. Mid-conversation with the owner I watched a man come into this dealership and demand new brakes and tires on a vehicle he bought a few weeks back apparently, and otherwise threatened to leave a bad review!! People like that get on my last nerve. These folks are selling good quality cars for a fraction of the price. If someone wants a brand new car they need to help themselves to a brand new car store. We don't see shops like this anymore, everything is being bought out and turned into a franchise sore where you would pay at a lot more for the exact same car. We need to value these people.

If I could leave 0 stars, I would.\n\nMy mother purchased a car a few weeks ago and today she decided to go on her lunch break and get her tag. Information that should've been provided during her purchase at the dealership was requested from the clerk at the tag/title office. She placed a call and got the owner on the phone and he was attemping to assist her. While he was able to eventually get her the information she needed the process of how she had to get the information from the owner was where she had an issue. She stated that there was a language barrier which she didn't personally mind BUT as she was on her lunch break and had limited time to talk she requested to speak with someone with better English that could accomodate her and articulate the information she needed in a timely manner. The owner became rude with her during her phonecall even prompting the clerk at the window to comment on his rudeness.\n\nI later accompanied her to his dealership as she needed to make a payment on her vehicle as well. Once arriving conveniently the owner was sitting on the front \"porch\" of the lot. When she expressed to him her issue with the process that it took to get information from him earlier and why she requested to speak with someone with better English he became rude with her again, and constantly interrupted her.  I happened to accompany her on this visit and made a comment about his direct rudeness. I guess he didn't take our visit too well because we'd interrupted his flirting with his employee but he then proceeded to invite the both of us into his office and present to us a dusty old box containing his many \"degrees\" which from what I saw were merely laminated certificates as if that gave him the right to conduct business and talk to us the way he did. I made the comment that both myself and my mother carried actual degrees from accredited universities, she even having her Masters which at the end of the day should not matter. Him having the title of \"OWNER\" and his many \"degrees\" should never give him the right to believe that he should be able to be rude to customers or anyone else for that matter. It takes way more than walking around and merely calling yourself a business owner. Its a matter of action as well. As an owner you should be able to take criticism and responsibility for your actions. A simple apology would've been good enough but my mother didn't even get that. I myself began to get upset because of the way he chose to speak to my mother. I simply could not allow it. I began to explain her position yet he attempted ot interrupt me like he did her. I wasn't allowing that either. Our conversation ended up being a mix of words in which he eventually summoned one of his employees into the room for reasons I still don't know. She attempted to explain that the owner was alone by himself at 8 AM until she was able to get into the office and the fact that she hadn't been able to hang up her purse because he asked her to take the phone. This made no difference to me or my mother because 1. She called around 1 PM not 8 AM & 2. As a business \"OWNER\" he should've done a better job with tailoring his business to order to fit the needs of customers. If you had staffing issues then as an \"OWNER\" it was on him to take on that matter himself. Either way it should not fall on the shoulders of the customer to deal with your rudeness and lack of customer service. My mother always raised me to be honest and to speak my mind so here I am speaking my mind and saying that the \"OWNER\" of this establishment is trash and should better spend his days gaining proper accreditation on what it means to be a good business owner and how to deliver good customer service as well taking some time to fix up his dealership because all it takes is for the wrong person to have an accident on that janky \"staircase\" on his lot and his entire business under fire due to lawsuit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923b189b005c9:0x6db750ee718606e9"}

This is not my first Hyundai since reinventing itself and blowing our minds. Needless to say I purchased what is now my 5th Hyundai.  However, i'm here to brag on the man who walked my husband and I through this entire process in this humid Alabama weather.  Initially, I came in to take advantage of the $50 GIFT CARD that Hyundai was offering for simply test driving its vehicles, but I also knew that I would potentially be driving off the lot with something new as well. Brandon Blagg was awesome from the gate. He stood and walked over to me, invited me to his desk, and inquired concerning my business. A few questions later, a copy of my license, and \"BAM\" we were test driving a base model Santa Fe.' One would think that this guy designed these vehicle with his level of knowledge concerning them. Recalling that I have own several vehicles in my lifetime, it is feasible to understand that we have dealt with our share of sales consultants. This is by far the first person who not only informed us of what we would potentially enjoy about the vehicle, but patiently explained in detail its benefits, and demonstrated  to us its functionality. He took a base model vehicle and literally painted a picture that lifted it beyond it's level. He hung out with us for over an hour doing comparisons and contrasts. He was honest concerning pro and cons, but never negative.. not one time. For him every vehicle had its benefits, and for every person there was vehicle that fit them. THIS IS WHAT HE DID! He didn't interfere with our choice, but he made sure that we would be satisfied once we left  the lot for good. In the end we ended up purchasing a Santa Fe' SEL 2.4 engine with both the Convenience and Premium Package. He didn't use a hustler tactic to cause us to go for a higher grade, it was simply his transparency and patience that ultimately led to our selection. Recalling that this was in 90 + degree weather, this man didn't stop until the tires shined.  He made me laugh, shared stories, explained who was whom of the CEO vs. COO, and also wasn't shy around me whatsoever. He even blew bubble gum bubbles for our delightful 6 year old who stood amazed at the excellence his gum blowing abilities. Brandon Blagg, job well done. You deserve all that's coming for your hard work and dedication to service. Aside from our direct experience with Brandon, everyone rocked. Their pleasantness was superb, two of the women conversed with me, they offered treats to my babies, and others smiled and waved. There wasn't a rude attitude in the building. The lobby and bathrooms are well designed and clean. As lengthly a process that car buying could be, they have enough going for themselves to make you relax and enjoy your time.\n\nThanks Again, Tae A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I test drove the vehicle on a Monday and pointed out a few cosmetic issues that I feel should have been addressed prior to placing the car up for sale (only a few hundred dollars to correct).  That combined with the manager coming outside to talk to me smoking a cigarette, should have clued me in to the professionalism and pride taken at the dealership.\nI was asked that if the problems I pointed out were corrected,  would I purchase the car? I agreed.  The following day I recieved the bill of sale and I noticed that the price shown on the internet was not the price shown on the bill of sale. When I asked the manager, the explanation I recieved was that the car was headed to auction the day I saw it and the price on the internet was the auction price, not the sale price (what does that have to do with me? And the price I came intending to pay is the price that I saw advertised ).  I was then told that they would sell it to me at the internet price but I would have to pay for the repairs which would be $400+.  Since the price was still under book value,  I agreed.  I was then told that the car would be repaired, HAND WAXED and ready for me in a couple days.  I was informed Friday that the car was ready. I drove up Saturday only to find the car just as dirty as it was when I test drove it on Monday(they sprayed the dirt off but there was still hair and dirt on the inside of the car.... wheel wells were dirty, etc). Of all the cars I've bought,  no one has ever tried to delivered me a dirty car! I discussed this with the manager who appeared to care nothing about it.  I left with no intention of buying the car,  but the salesman,\nMr. Willie, called and said that he would take care of it...... he took it to a local shop and had it washed and vacuumed.  As a customer, when money is spent, whether it be $30 or $30,000, you want to feel good about spending it. That's not the feeling I left with.

And if you do, please, make sure you ask them to print and show you any TSB's (Technical Service Bulletin) on the vehicle you are considering.

However, I can almost promise you that they will not make the repairs before selling you the vehicle. I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Entourage van from Jim Burke Hyundai's used car dealership in March this year after having purchased a new Elantra from them last year. I did not make them show me the TSB's because I wasn't aware of them at the time. Unfortunately there are several of them on the van I purchased. One of them had to do with a part that causes called the \"Junction Box Switch\" or Instrument Panel Module that causes the battery to discharge. That means when you go out to your car it simply won't start!! I found the TSB on it and it says in large print that it was issued to all Hyundai General Managers and that the repair should be made before retail sale of the van. Many of us believe that purchasing a used car from what you think is a reputable dealership will protect you from these type issues. Well...this dealership is not reputable and should be put out of business. I have contacted them to give them a change to try and make this right to keep customers happy and try to get return business but they obviously are not intersted in this.

Our customers' safety and satisfaction are our number one priorities, and we never want anyone to drive away feeling that they've been treated like anything less than Royalty. After reviewing your maintenance records, we maintain that the costs associated with your repairs were fair and commensurate with the market price of the parts and labor necessary to execute them. As factory-certified professionals, we would never intentionally misrepresent the value of the parts required to get your vehicle back on the road, nor the value of the time it takes to get the job done right the first time. In the case of your vehicle, the ignition coils, spark plug kit, reinsulation, and other accompanying expenses represented a significant value of our technicians' time and part resources\u2013all consistent with the final costs presented to you. We'd be grateful for the opportunity to talk further with you, come to an understanding, and hopefully make things right.

Again in the morning I take it back. Again they check it send me on my way 30 minutes later car hot again. I call and was pretty much brushed off and was told that they fixed what they thought was the problem. So as of right now I've been charged all this money car still running hot n they acting like it's cool I came in with 1 problem which has still not to be resolved. I will I'm so disappointed I travel alot for work and I'm in Alabama all alone no family I came here expecting a1 service seeing that it's connected to a napa but to spend this type of money and my issue not be fixed I'm so disappointed.

I am actually about 1,000 miles away from the dealership, and at first, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. I then spoke to Warren Fuller and everything just clicked. He was able to face-time me to show me the vehicle and he also let me know of any imperfections that were found.  I then asked if they could take it to an independent mechanic of my choice to get it fully inspected and they agreed without hesitation. This reassured me that I was dealing with an honest dealership. After everything came out clean, I flew out there, and once I arrived, I was out in about 15 minutes. I then drove back the 1,000 miles with my, new to me, 2015 Lexus GS 350 F sport, which drove like a dream.

When the car was delivered and I had a few minor concerns following the test drive, Warren worked with me to make the car just what I needed. Birmingham Luxury Motors gave me an out the door price (car, tax, tag and title) prior to test driving so that I would know exactly what I'd be paying.

The big reason for getting out of the Land Rover was the out of sight repair costs, even  for little things.  This will be important later on, so keep the Land Rover in mind.\n\nWe wanted an inexpensive to own car, so we were mostly looking for a Honda Accord, and online searching took us all over the place, but we actually held Oskar Motors for last.  I wish we would have just gone there first, because we were beginning to believe that a car for under 15k was just going to come with odd smells and cigarette burns.  Oskar had plenty of Accords that were almost as good as new, and without the burns and smells.  Even better, they were about $1000 less than the closest competitor.\n\nThe Salesman (Warren) was up front about every car, pointing out the pros and cons of each vehicle, even so far as to point out things we had expected any dealership to hide.  In the end, we picked one of about 10 Accords on the lot, and that was more than any other place we had been to, even the Honda dealerships.\n\nThe Land Rover matters because we considered trading it at Oskar, but again, the salesman was up front in explaining that they weren't going to come in real strong on the trade in because Land Rover just wasn't the kind of car they want to deal in.  They like to sell inexpensive and reliable cars, and a Land Rover that is out of warranty is just more of a head ache than most people want to deal with (a lesson hard learned by us just a few weeks ago with a $4700 repair bill).  He went as far as to tell us where we were likely to get top dollar for it, and I think that speaks loudly of a business model based on trust, and earning repeat business.\n\nIf I sound like a commercial for Oskar, I guess I will have to plead guilty because I was beginning to become frustrated with all of the shopping, and I almost didn't even go.  I was sure that their cars had to be heaps of trash compared to any we had seen that day, and I was basing that off of the \"too good to be true\" rule.  Warren did a pretty good job of removing the built up stress, and making us feel like we weren't having to be on guard against a car sales scam, and even better, he sold us a great car at a great price.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1512158793774, "text": "Dear Jason,\nThank you for your 5 star review and candid comments to Oskar Motors and it's superstar, Warren.

I finally gave up.\n\nThey could have easily offered help in other ways: by referring me to a mechanic, by referring me to a salvage yard that would give me a fair price for it, or by offering me a trade-in value for it. Instead they led me on for weeks. I was so naive to believe that they were trying to help me out.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1471020032761, "text": "We are sorry that you\u2019ve had an unpleasant experience. Customer satisfaction is our top priority and with that goal in mind we highly recommend that our customers purchase an extended warranty. Extended warranties are an industry standard with used car purchases, especially when the manufacturer\u2019s warranty has expired. Close to 100% of our customers take that option. Used cars are sold \u2018as is\u2019 and the only insurance you have on your purchase is extended warranty, which you opted out of. We have a fine selection of vehicles at great prices... our customers are our greatest advocates because they have such a great experience with us. But every now and then, something goes wrong with a car that could not be predicted ahead of time since it checks out fine on all counts.\n\nWe\u2019ve checked our records to confirm that you indeed got a great deal for the car when you came in on June 25th. The first time you called (on July 10), Stephen went above his call of duty when he answered your call at 3:00am on a weekend. Having confirmed with the owners that he could still offer you the extended warranty, he recommended it to you once again when you called back on July 12th. You turned that option down once again and with that embraced the risk of any unpredictable issues with your vehicle."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923b3b3c19cd5:0xff6adcf2b6c57d45"}

I spent a lot of time on the on-line auto sites, and I found \"The One\" at City Auto of Hueytown.  I called and talked with Donnie on the phone.  He was very helpful, I explained that I was looking for a really clean car, he assured me the car I was interested in was very nice, and he felt I would not be disappointed.  He provided a clean carfax report, that showed the car only had two owners, and lots of service records, nothing bad .  I told him I would make the trip from Atlanta to look at the car.  I rented a car, and drove from Atlanta (2.5 hour drive). When I arrived, the car was freshly washed, Donnie had it parked out front where I could look it over good.  We took it for a test drive, and when we returned, I looked at every nook and crannie.on this car.  The car was very nice. ( I have 20+ years experience writing Auto Body Repair estimates, I know what I am looking at)\nDonnie, Ken the owner and myself worked out a great deal.  EVERYONE there was VERY SINCERE, and HELPFUL !.  They went way above and beyond to make this work for me, I got a great car at a great price !  I am not easy to sell a car to, ( I have looked at many recently), but I am sure I made the right choice !

I rented a car, and drove from Atlanta (2.5 hour drive). When I arrived, the car was freshly washed, Donnie had it parked out front where I could look it over good.  We took it for a test drive, and when we returned, I looked at every nook and crannie.on this car.  The car was very nice.

We needed a vehicle,  after many lies about prices and vehicles, the only one they would sell us was one that had more milage, and the interior was in worse shape.  They are not upfront about prices, I specifically asked a price of a vehicle and they wouldn't tell me, all they would say is that it wouldn't work out.  I looked it up on there website and it would have worked, they just wanted to make a profit.  I have never seen a dealership that is so dishonest, and sneaky.  I would absolutely love to report these crooks to the Better Business Bureau!!

If you are in need of a car these people will go through all hoops to sit you in one of the vehicles THEY choose for you. If you need a car and want to be screwed for years then purchase a vehicle from this company. We bought a truck from them 2 years ago and they told us after they financed us with a 21% interest rate that we could refinance the truck a year later through the lender well they lied and they knew it. They gave us the whole build your credit scam.The truck had reached the year limit of refinance 9 months after we owned the vehicle. We were stuck and under in the vehicle. Fortunately by the grace of God we got out of the loan and paid it off. They were overpriced and used sneaky tactics to get rid of the vehicle. They were rude and very pushy and I will never send anyone here to purchase a car and I advise you to look somewhere else. City Auto Sales- reviews hurt and I hope after this post that more will follow. You guys need to take a look at your business ethics. Your lucky I gave you 2 stars since I was the uneducated person that followed through with the deal and the truck still works. Update May 2015- The motor needs to be replaced and the national lifetime warranty they sell you is not worth a penny. We have been 3 weeks without a vehicle and it is at the Dealer (Edwards Chevrolet) The warranty people are trying so hard to get out of repairing the motor. I called to speak to BOB and requested the service records that the warranty that they sold me needs and he refused to give me the records showing what what serviced on the truck before selling it to us. SO CITY AUTO SALES will not even work with the warranty that they sell you to repair the shitty vehicle they sold you in the first place. They still have not given us our money that needed to be refunded for the GAP insurance we bought. This has been requested from guess who BOB for 3 months now. They are the most horrible dealer you could ever want to purchase from. Please spread the word about how shitty their company is and how they really treat there customers after a sale.

I live in GA and the dealership is in Alabama. I was going to drive out the after speaking with Kirk the sales guy, he said they could bring it to me and boy did they.\n\nThe vehicle was advertised for on price online, but that is not the price I actually paid. I bought the car sight unseen and was assured that it was almost new. Upon delivery the plastic piece for the roof fell off and hit me in the head. Then I drove it 37 miles home smelled something burning and text him immediately, he replied telling me they had just changed the oil the night before delivery.\n\nThe car has not moved since I purchased it due to the oil leak. I scheduled an appt at the dealership for today and received the shock of a lifetime. The car needs extensive motor work costing me an additional over $2000.00 plus an oil change, because the oil they drained from the car looked like a thick milkshake.....(that's a lot considering I put down $5000.00). When I brought the leaks (antifreeze and oil) to Kirks attention he assured me it was run off due to the fact they changed the oil the night before. He told me to let him know if it was still leaking in a couple of days and he would see what they could do. Two days later, I sent him a picture via text of the massive oil leaking all over my garage floor and never heard anything back.\n\nI am a single mother of four children. I bought this car on good faith so that I could give to my baby girl. I currently own two 5 series BMW's one is a 2013 & the other is 2005 that are both dealer maintained. I due understand with a used vehicle there may be issues however, this is unbelievable.  I believe they new the status of this vehicle before they sold it. That's why I never received any return corespondence.\n\nI am a very trusting and loyal buyer, but this experience was truly an eye opening experience. ** Please for your own sake, do not waste your time or your money at City Auto Sales!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e6d40fa9698b:0x840e9b904f5e5047"}

I had money that i had saved for months with hard work. I went there the first day just to check it out with my money in hand. I did not have any of the requirements any true dealership would ask for in order to approve you. They took my money easily and let me go with the car without being approved yet. days later told me to return the car because i wasn't approved and i had already paid for full coverage insurance. They stole my money and wanted me to go take the car, and threatened me saying they were going to report the car stolen when i had prove they had taken my money. They were so sacred to know that they were going down that unprofessionally came in the middle of the night to take the car and messed up my property and my neighbors. Where is the police report where i had stolen the car from their lot? That is how they keep the dealership ruining taking my down payment and keeping the car to resale it. What makes you think that is not going to be you next? One of the thousand proofs i have is that when they took my money and told me i was good to go they hadn't given me any paperwork or receipts until I personally asked for it. I'll give you a name to find in your system Pablo Mejia. Why not tell me I was not approved before taking my down payment and letting me take the car and then keep down payment and car? Abusive people. El lugar m\u00e1s horrible para ir. Ten\u00eda dinero que hab\u00eda ahorrado durante meses con mucho trabajo. Fui all\u00ed el primer d\u00eda solo para verlo con mi dinero en mano. No ten\u00eda ninguno de los requisitos que cualquier concesionario verdadero pedir\u00eda para probarlo. Tomaron mi dinero f\u00e1cilmente y me dejaron ir con el auto sin ser aprobado todav\u00eda. d\u00edas despu\u00e9s me dijeron que devolviera el auto porque no estaba aprobado y ya hab\u00eda pagado el seguro de cobertura total. Me robaron el dinero y quer\u00edan que yo tomara el auto, y me amenazaron diciendo que iban a denunciar el auto robado cuando demostrara que me hab\u00edan quitado el dinero. Eran tan sagrados al saber que estaban bajando que, sin profesionalidad, llegaron a media noche para tomar el autom\u00f3vil y arruinaron mi propiedad y mis vecinos. \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el informe policial donde hab\u00eda robado el auto de su lote? As\u00ed es como mantienen el concesionario arruinado tomando mi pago inicial y manteniendo el auto para revenderlo. \u00bfQu\u00e9 te hace pensar que no vas a ser el pr\u00f3ximo? Una de las mil pruebas que tengo es que cuando tomaron mi dinero y me dijeron que estaba listo para irme, no me hab\u00edan dado ning\u00fan papeleo o recibos hasta que lo solicit\u00e9 personalmente. Por que no desirme que no aprobe antes de quitarme el dinero? Gente abusiva.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888927583d8adbd5:0x412e69fa1f0f4fee"}

But It did have a few details to it like not having the light bulb working so we went to buy it ourselves. We called the next day so they could put it on for us and they complained about us buying it! They said they were going to fix the scratches it had all over the door and the hood and also the dent. A month later after we bought it it need it new tires. Okay no problem. 2 months later we took it to get rims replaced for new ones because it would shake. So I went to go pick it up and everything was fine until it wouldn't turn on. They though It didn't have gas so they went to go buy some and put some in, it still didn't want to turn on. Then they wanted to see if it need a jump start, and nope that didn't work. Then they tried the batteries,it finally turned on. After I was going to leave they wanted me to pay for the gas they had put! Haha yeah right that's wasn't my fault,that was on y'all. I left and right when I was about to get to my house the car stoped completely and it didn't want to start. (I was holding the traffic) embarrassing! A few minutes later it started again. I let the car take a brake for a few hours. (4 hours to be exact) I needed to go pick up my husband from work. So I left in the car and again the car turned off on me with traffic behind me! My husband got home and we went to go try it out to see what he thought it could be and it was running good for about 35 minutes but it didn't last longer then that because once again it stoped on the highway! We had to called a tow truck to take it back home.  We had the car for only  3 months and it's messed up we tried calling and calling and they said they couldn't help us because they didn't have a mechanic guy available.  And we called again and still nothing they could do about it so we towed it to another dealer, and we haven't had the car in a month. someone needs to figure something out because we do NOT want the car anymore nobody form your  dealership is welling to help us, and we are tired of it, and tired of not have the car!

Lex, Chad, Gary and the owner (I can't recall his name) made buying a car a lot less stressful than I have encountered in the past few months of looking. They were honest and did everything in their power to get us into the 2013 Honda Odyssey that I found on their lot. Great car and great experience. Always felt like I was dealing with real people and not someone just trying to make the sale. Great, clean cars at a great price. Would highly recommend anyone looking for a good car to check here first. The local dealerships turned me off before I even stepped foot on their lot to look at inventory. I would guess they purchase most of their cars at auctions, which isn't a bad thing. The bells and whistles of having everything perfect weren't there but I would rather have that than an over priced liar. Buying a used car is so stressful, but they made it down to earth and doable. Would definitely recommend these folks if you are value conscious.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4173f356ef59:0x86af69db2ad706fe"}

He showed me a 2008 Lincoln, not at all what we were looking for but I instantly fell in love. After some negotiation we settled on a fair price and I drove out of the lot with my beautiful new car. Later that evening I took it for a drive and it started acting crazy, I panicked! My first thought was omg I signed an \"as Is\" agreement! I called Marcus and he told me not to worry that they would take care of me and they did. They picked up the car, found out the problem, fixed the problem, gave me a rental until it was fixed, and returned it to me in a timely manner. Marcus and Roger were absolutely amazing and made sure I drove away a happy customer. Any future car I purchase will come from off lease, no questions asked. They treated me like family and have by far the best customer service I have ever experienced anywhere.

At the time that I purchased the vehicle, all of the paper work went smoothly, my loan was approved, I even provided full coverage insurance and copies of all of my paperwork in order to expedite the tag and registration process. Once the 30 day mark approached I began calling both my bank and the dealership to get information regarding the title to my vehicle so that I could begin applying for the appropriate tag required by LAW for me to drive my vehicle. My bank informed me that the OFF LEASE AUTO car dealership would have my title and all information I would need in order to apply for the proper tag. My bank also informed me that once the dealership received the title it would basically be instantaneously sent over to my bank. With that information I leave the bank alone and begin calling the car dealership for an ESTIMATE of when my title info would arrive, The first day that I called a sales man transferred me to Carla/Carroll's office. No answer. So I left a detailed message. I call twice the next day and get sent to the same office.Left a message. The third day I left them know Carla/Carroll is not answering the phone or returning my phone calls. Jerry writes down a message from me to give to Carroll. I wait a day, still no response, On the 5th day I refuse to be transferred or placed on hold until I get some kind of information on the whereabouts of my title after I purchased the vehicle 34 days.

The internet price sounded good for the car I was looking for.  The dealership did honor the internet price.  The car drove nice, and  looked good.  They gave me the NADA book value for my trade in, however there was one stipulation.  I had a hard top made for my car that was my trade in.  It was a convertible, we had it made, it was after market, and costly.  In order to get the book value for my trade in, we had to throw in the hard top.  My trade in was in excellent very clean condition, and very well maintained, had always been garaged.  So we did consent to that, we agreed they could have the hard top, because I wanted a good down payment toward the car I was purchasing.  The owner came over and introduced himself, everyone was very cordial, there was no pressure.  He said he always makes things right with his customers that buy from him.  BUT, as soon as the deal was done, that was it.  As we drove away we noticed there was no key fob on the key ring.  One of the advertised features was automatic start.  They never said one word about that.  Also, there was no owners manual in the car.  So I called the back Off Lease Auto dealership, our salesperson stated that the dealership would not pay for it.  They would contact our local auto dealer in Florida close to our home to see if they would order those items for us at wholesale price.  Which they failed to do.   We called and called and emailed numerous times, our phone calls were dodged, emails left unanswered.  Right after the sale the owner was fast to drive out to our house over an hour away to pick up the expensive aftermarket hard top, that technically  should not have been just thrown into the book value.  That is the last we would hear from any of them.  We went to our local dealer, had the car checked out to make sure it was safe and so we would know if there were any issues.  At the same time we ordered the missing auto start key fob, and owners manual at our own expense, since it was becoming more obvious as each day passed that Off Lease was not going to do anything to make it right as the owner had promised before we signed all the paperwork.  The car also needed an alignment very badly, and marker plate bulbs were out.  This should have been part of their safety check, that is required by law.  They neglected to do, when this was mentioned to the owner when he was picking up the hard top we pretty much gave away to him.  His response was \"well, you didn't buy a new car, ya know.\"   Oh Really now.\nBuyer Beware.\nI would not recommend this dealership after our experience.  As nice as the people were prior to the purchase, after the deal is done you are on your own.  They are not equipped to do most repairs at their shop, even if they were willing.  Which they stated they would do after we purchase the car.\nBest of luck if you do go there, you'll need it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4173f356ef59:0x86af69db2ad706fe"}

Here's me story, I purchased a used Cadillac SRX for Off Lease Auto Outlet in Jan 2018 and paid cash along with a trade in of my old car that was paid off. I signed over the title for my old car to them and paid them cash for the balance of the purchase price. I was told that the title and sales taxes that I paid for the vehicle would be sent to me with in 20 days of the transaction. I have called the dmv to see if they received the title and they have not. The DMV recommends calling the dealership to track the title. I have called the dealership probably 30 times to find out what the status of my tile is and spoke to several people there during this process. Some of the names of the people I spoke to are Devin, Jose, Britany, Ricky, Tacey and the Manager. All of which have told me to talk to the owner Ashley Booth who does the title work. I have left several messages with Mr Booth and he has yet to return or take any of my calls. It is now February 27 2018 and my temporary tag on the new used car is expired and I still have not received my title. I have recently hired an attorney to rectify this situation. I started out by sending them a certified demand letter demanding that they send me my title. Apparently Alabama requires sending this before pursuing a legal resolution to the problem. I am currently driving my car on an expired temporary tag. I have filed complaints with the Alabama Attorney General, the Better Business Bureau and filling out as many reviews I can to get the work out. Save yourself some misery and avoid this place! You know what they say \"when a deal is to good to be true it probably isn't\" This place is shady and needs to be shut down.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4173f356ef59:0x86af69db2ad706fe"}

I had looked through many sites and found the perfect one at Off Lease Auto Outlet in Daphne. I drive all the way to the dealership and test drive the 2008 Chrysler Town & Country Touring. On the test drive I had looked the automobile over. Inside and out. On inspection I did find a few scratches here and there. NO cracked windshield. Got inside to start the paperwork. This is where things started going down hill. I had brought a print out of the 2008 Chrysler Town & Country Touring  from the Off Lease Auto Outlet webpage. The price that was on the internet was $6,997. The dealer Stephen tried to tell me that the car was listed incorrectly on the website. If this was true it had been listed incorrectly for 68 days. Not likely. Stephen then told me that I would have to pay $8,999 for the 2008 Chrysler Town & Country Touring  that was listed for $6,997. I told Stephen that, this was incorrect and that they were supposed to honor the online price. After about 30 min. to an hour of going back and forth with Stephen and the dealership about the price. They finally agreed to sell the van to me at the price of $6,997, which was only fair. I was taken over to the finance man and we started working on the paperwork. Then another problem came up. They did not want to finance the low amount and wanted to \"add\" some to the price so that it could be financed. This was insane I had never heard of adding to a price just to get the automobile financed. So, we left the dealership empty-handed.  I then called Stephen two days later and let him know that I would like to pay cash for the 2008 Chrysler Town & Country Touring . I even made a $1,500 down payment over the phone due to the fact that I was in the hospital recovering from an unexpected  illness. Stephen told me that they would bring the van around back and park it till I can come pick it up. I go a few weeks later to pick up the van. I noticed tinny pings from gravel or something all over the windshield after driving off the lot and down the road. When I called about this I was told that they could do nothing to help with this problem that they had already lost so much selling me the van at the price that I saw it advertised for on the website.  The next day that I came out to get in the van the little ping marks had turned into full blown cracks. This did not occur in my drive. A windshield does not crack like that overnight. Something happened to the van while it was on the lot. But Off Lease Auto Outlet refused to make it right by either repairing or replacing the windshield that was cracked while the van sat on their lot. I was told by Stephen that \"It was not their problem now\" I thought that Off Lease Auto Outlet would want to make this right and correct the situation. All I got was a run around and spoken very rude to by Off Lease Auto Outlet Staff. So now I have an automobile that is three days old to me and it just sits in my drive because it is illegal to drive an automobile with a cracked windshield. I was told file it on my insurance. Only problem there is it happened on the lot not by fault of mine. So now I have to save at lease $500 or more to replace the windshield of an automobile that I just bought. I will NEVER buy another automobile from this shady lot again. I can not believe this lot did this. I thought there were laws in place to prevent this type of thing. I would not have even given Off Lease Auto Outlet in Daphne one star but I had to give a rating to post my review. It should be a minus five stars. Such horrible customer service and the staff was so rude. They refused to fix a problem that was a fault of their own. Buyer beware, this dealership also pressure washed the motor to make it look clean so you will not think there are any leaks or anything wrong with an automobile.

The salesperson tommie was very helpful with getting me into a car. I started having problems with the car the following month of actually getting the car. The owner was very rude about having to fix the car (that was never fixed from the start because it was in the back of the lot right off of a truck that brought cars in). 5 days After taking my car back to be fixed because my hood wouldnt close it turned out to be more problems with the car than expected. The owner complained about how much money he had to put into getting the car fixed which wasn't my fault. I made him aware that this was the only transportation and that my kids had missed the entire week of school and he said \"well! U asked us to fix the car so we are fixing it\" after my husband heard how i was being spoken to on the phone by the owner he told the owner that he didnt appreciate the way he was speaking to me. The owner then called the finance company and purchased the car back from them while the car was in his possession without letting me know what was happening. After calling from several different numbers (because they would no longer answer for mine) i finally spoke with the owner and he was extremely rude and my husband over heard the conversation and intervened letting the owner know that he wouldn't talk to me in that manor. Even After apologizing for him being rude to me or what he thought was getting smart with him he pretty much told me it was nothing he could do about my down payment or the payments I've made towards purchasing the vehicle. The owner is very unprofessional and rude he is not sympathetic with anyone and if i could give this car lot 0 stars i would. I would never recommend anyone that i know to this car lot they are a scam not to mention I've had the car since march and never recieved my tag paper work so I'm stuck paying tickets for a car i no longer have and EVERYTHING that has happened is because of suncoast unprofessional owner and the scams that he pull. I hope the next mother that is working hard to take care of her kids will read this and not waste money with these clowns because if u let them they'll take advantage of u too and take all out your money leaving u and kids stranded while they get richer off of messing over kind people.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da89592edd7:0x7f5e43c6e7fedb73"}

I decided not to buy the car which put me on a rental status. The car I was looking at buying had an exhaust leak, it had been in a front end collision and was falling apart. The work that needed to be done was not a issue. When I went in to get my money back the manager Tony took his sweet time in getting to me and was really rude about it. I brought the car back yesterday at 8:15 am and it was 2:30 by the time he decided he would deal with me. He charged me 100$ for 2 days that I didnt even have the car fully (picked it up monday night close to closing and returned yesterday at opening). He told me in the middle of fighting with him about the days that \"this country has laws\" which obviously. He fought with me about paying me back my money when I hadnt even signed the purchase agreement. He told me I was lucky he wasnt charging me for gas, to have it cleaned and washed. I received the car with no gas in it at all and it was dirty. There were mold spores growing on the roof and the roof was cracked on the exterior. Functions in the car didnt work properly and the transmission was on its way out. The brakes had two inches of play in them. 5 miles down the road the service light had come on and the car started shifting funny. Took it to Advanced Auto and had them hook it up. It gave a malfunction code. Which I didnt stress cause it had gone away within a hour, but had called about it. They had lost the keys to it but did have 2 new keys made. The manager of this place is extremely rude, especially towards women. I had raised my voice and told him it was BS that he was charging me for days I didnt have the car and that I had to wait 6.5 hours for him to cut me a check back of my own money. He threw me out of his office after I had to fight the check out of him. This is a place I will never do business. I have never met someone so rude in customer service and called him out on it. I lost 322.56 to this guy and he told me he wasnt making a dime. Looks to me like he made a few hundred. I dont have a issue paying what I needed to pay but I do have a issue of paying for days that the car was not in a possession for the full day. I would have payed less at a car rental company instead of 50$ a day and .36 a mile. This place is highway robbery. They wanted 22k for a 2007 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer Edition with 122k on it that was falling apart. Good thing my husband had no interest in buying this vehicle and we returned it. I couldnt imagine being locked down to this guy for the next 4 years. My recommendation is to not do business with this company solely do to the guy who manages it and he will rip you off. He treats his own employees like crap. The only reason they got 1 star is because not possible to leave it blank.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da89592edd7:0x7f5e43c6e7fedb73"}

The local companies killed my car, so I traded it in. When doing so JEFF practically tried to scam me. I bought the car in April and didn\u2019t receive any of my paper work until the end of may, that net me a $15 penalty with the DMV for late registration.

Now I have to go through the issue of getting my payments reapplied and corrected so that I\u2019m not in the red on my current vehicle.  If you really really want a Kia go somewhere else. He should never have been allowed to do my paperwork if he wasn\u2019t going to do it right, especially when I left with what I feel is a cheaper version of the car I had.\n\nOnce this is settled and over I hope to never have to step foot near this place again.

Well we thought we did. The entire time \u201cMojo\u201d showed the truck, we discussed the motor as well as the other features. Then when we sat down and talked numbers, he presented a piece of paper comparing it to all the other 2016 model F-150s within so many miles and my fianc\u00e9 noticed the motor was listed different than every single other listing,\u00a0so he asked \u201cthis may be a dumb question but this truck\u2019s motor is listed differently. Is that just the way you guys typed it up? Is this truck a twin turbo EcoBoost like the rest?\u201d Mojo replied with \u201c yes exactly\u201d. So we moved forward and we bought the truck. That following\u00a0Sunday my fianc\u00e9 went to look under the hood at something and after some research he found out\u00a0it did not have the 3.5L EcoBoost motor. He called the following \u202aMonday morning\u202c and talked to Mojo. He stated said \u201cmojo do you remember us talking about the truck being an EcoBoost and showing me the comparison sheet of the surround F-150s,\u00a0and I asked about the motor being an EcoBoost, even though it didn\u2019t match up to everything else and you told me yes it is?\u201d He said \u201cyea, yea I do\u201d then My Fianc\u00e8 said \u201cwell Mojo it\u2019s not an EcoBoost. It\u2019s a plain V6.\u201d\u00a0His response was. \u201cOh $@it\u201d. He then said he would talk to management and get back with him. My fianc\u00e9 called him two different times that day.

Both responses were via\u00a0text messages. He would not answer a phone call. So we then called and spoke to a sales manager and he was nice but didn\u2019t have any more to offer. After a couple weeks we were finally able to talk to the sales manager that was working the day we bought the truck. At this point we were over having to deal with them so we settled for a few oil changes and floor mats since the truck didn\u2019t come with any. He stated \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be cheap mats\u201d. Once they finally came in we went and picked them up from the dealership, and they were universal Riverchase kia mats that no where near fill up any of the back seat floor board. We bought better ones from Walmart than the ones they gave us and he only gave one more oil change than the original one. We find this to be highly unprofessional and unsatisfactory. There are thousands of dollars difference as well as the evident performance differences. I\u2019ve also bought a brand new Kia from them in 2017 and it\u2019s crazy we get treated this way after spending so much money with them. I hope that people read this and choose to take their business else where.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

I honestly felt like my sales man Teddy Frye had my back.. Or at least that's what he wanted me to think. I do not recommend coming here and using Teddy Frye. He's not honest and will lie to your face about the price just to make a sale. And after you buy from him don't expect him to have the common courtesy to call you back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My lights were flickering on and off in my 2014 KIA Soul and I was scared to drive at night. My warranty was about to expire and I wanted to get my lights checked out. Early August 2018 I drove over to Riverchase KIA early one morning and I told them what was going on with my 2014 KIA. I also needed and oil changed. I waited over an hour for the shuttle to drive me to work, the shuttle drive did not know I needed a ride and HE was super nice!! I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash.

I honestly feel bad for anyone that works for someone that has to constantly put their employees down since he is the only one that would know how to do anything.\nWhen I stopped by he was very rude and even told me in front of a group of people while hanging onto my car door I wouldn't be happy without getting something free...I told him I would be happy with an actual call back. My car is under warranty, and the SA had even told me she would reach out to a used or new car sales manager for assistance since she wasn't able to get a response (they have no control over service but she was trying). Rating mid level or lower doesn't matter on service reviews, no inquiry then either. After I left, I called the dealership to speak to the GM.

The previous advisors and manager were easy to deal with, albeit I have no idea on the work part not being done as mentioned by new SA.

The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash. Thanks Julio Jones KIA for doing your job and making me feel safe!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

Wednesday as I\u2019m driving home, oil light comes on and smoke from under the hood. I made it home and found oil leaking from under the car. I call Wednesday to make an appointment to bring my car in on Thursday to be fixed. Thursday I arrive around 8:20 that morning and drop the car off so I could get to work that I was already late for. I called them around 1-2pm the evening to check status of my car. Season stated they hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet and it was being sent somewhere else were it would be checked out in more detail. So they put me in a rental covered by them. They called Friday afternoon and said my car was ready and I asked why was it leaking oil and they said the plug was stripped and that it wasn\u2019t a Kia plug. If the technician knew the plug was stripped why did he put it back on there, regardless of if it was a Kia plug or not. Also, Wednesday when I came to drop the car off, I told them that I would like to get the recalls fixed on it since I already had to drop the car off. I asked the person checking me in did he need the recall papers that I had gotten sent in the mail and he said he could look it up by the VIN. Saturday morning I come in to pick up my car and ask them for diagnostic report on what was done on the car & they tell me about the plug and I asked were the recalls fixed and they said it wasn\u2019t any notes about a recall needing to be fixed. The guy that checked me in Wednesday stated he didn\u2019t remember me saying anything about a recall and he was sorry, Season said they would get it in to be fixed because of the situation but they normally do not do recalls on saturdays. I already knew that because of the previous Saturday I came in for the oil change and asked about the recall. So I guess the pros would be that she did say they would fix the recalls but cons is that I still have to sit and wait on my car on something that they were supposed to had already done. I also spoke with Tim the supervisor about the issues that I was having. I am stuck in a hard place because Riverchase Kia is the only Kia dealership in Birmingham, and I don\u2019t want just any person working on my car and thought I was doing the right thing by bringing to their service center. So I gave them two stars, one for getting the recalls fixed on a Saturday and the other for putting me in a rental while they were getting my vehicle fixed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

I first drove an Accent and liked it, but the salesman just smiled at me when we mentioned the particulars of my old vehicle for trade. We headed to Riverchase Kia and were greeted in the parking lot by salesman Mr. Harvey. From Mr. Harvey\u2019s handshake forward he made us feel like we were going to leave with a new car at a monthly payment I can afford. And we did! Mr. Harvy offered us a most generous trade-in value for my old car and worked very hard all afternoon to finally match our financial goal. I love my new Kia Soul. It\u2019s the perfect car for me.

He was so sweet (I almost want to put that into satirical marks) while we talked through wait periods. Good family guy who is proud of his kids and was very generous in his compliments to my husband. This was fine. I would have left a 5 star review with just that interaction. He didn't seem to push us into anything particular or expensive because we knew what we wanted and he knew that too. To be honest, my husband knew more about the cars on that lot than most of the salesmen at the store. To be even more honest, we had no intentions of buying a car that day, but we were talked into it. Not a horrible choice, but not my optimum choice at this time. In the end I wanted to make my husband happy and get a hybrid because it is better for the environment and because we commute a lot. I would have waited a year or two before doing this, but that is out the window now. However, all of that isn't the issue. While we were there, everyone was nice. Stayed there for almost 5 hours getting paperwork done and waiting to be approved for a loan. We're young and like to talk, so we didn't mind. We get a fair interest rate, seeing as how my husband just came out of bankruptcy. This is good. We sign all the contracts, my husband haggles about the extra warranty. All of that is good. We hand over the keys to the car we traded in, clean it out and into our new car, etc. All of the contracts are signed, everything is good. We leave HAPPY. Very happy. Extremely proud of our car.\n\nThis is when things start to go bad. I get a call a few days later because they lost my husband's pay stub. No problem. He sends an email with a new one. This apparently isn't \"clear\" enough \"for the banks.\" Alright. So he sends another one, a PDF copy as clear as day. A human mistake happens and he misspelled Stan's email (missed 1 s). A week almost goes by and I haven't gotten any calls, and neither has my husband. We think everything is fine so we forget about it. Not to mention, it is the end of the semester for me, so the only thing I am worried about it getting homework done, studying for exams, and emailing people from my school email. This, however, is where some of the blame falls onto me. I had gotten 3 emails from Stan on the 4th and on the 5th. The email on the 4th was fine. It just wanted a new copy because he couldn't find an attachment (because of the mess up earlier as my husband was at work and had just made a human error). The third and last email is where I am taking away 3 stars and am very upset about. It is added into this review, untouched outside of cutting away unnecessary bits of the screenshot of my computer screen. Seeing as how the place is a business, I find no issue with giving away the details in this email. In my opinion, I find the tone of the email to be very unprofessional, threatening, and rude. He could have called (in my call logs I received no calls from him and neither did my husband). Calling would have resolved the issue immediately because any decent person would have realized the mistake and apologized and immediately resent the email correctly with the attachment. Yet, it is okay to threaten to take away a car. And I get it. The bank is putting on pressure to get the pay stub or else they will back out and that is bad for the dealership. However, WE weren't the ones who lost the original pay stub in the first place. WE weren't contacted in a more timely manner about it via phone call. Instead, my junk email just so happened to get checked by my husband yesterday while he was handling other business on the phone and he sees all of the emails. He resends what needs to be resent, and now we wait to see if any other \"problems\" will arise. Will our signatures be unclear next and somehow void our contract? Will they try to repossess our car because of any other errors on their behalf? Only time will tell.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

But Teddy took one look at the scratch got the dealership manager and the service manager involved, walked back into the waiting area and said, \"We're going to give you a different new car instead.\" Wow!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1472652512613, "text": "We are thrilled that you had such an amazing experience working with us here at Riverchase Kia, Gregg!

Let me provide you a little setup for my situation that this amazing dealership managed to turn around for me. End of 2014 my old Saturn (yes, the car dealer that went under) with its cracked suspension was traded into a dealership that I thought was reputable. Well put you in a new car they said, don't worry about your credit they said, I end up in the most manual of manuals; roll down windows and all Versa Note. Alright, I can turn this around, I tell myself, they said come back in a year and well get you in something nicer. Year rolls by, go back, \"Nope your credit isn't good enough, you got money to put down? Nope, then cant help you, try again next year.\" Alright, so I continue with this car that I am not happy with, upgrade jobs, still upside down in this car years later. Now its December 2017, still upside down in a car I am not happy with. I hear a jingle on my radio, you all know the one, \"We wanna see yea at Riverchase Kia.\" My wife and I talk and decide lets take a chance, what have we got to lose, if we don't like it we can always walk away. I do my research, and go in with an open mind, telling myself I want one of two vehicles. Optima or Forte. I park at the dealership and out walks one of the best, brightest, and positive salespersons I have ever met. Mr. Lionel T. Lee. I had time to stand and stretch on this cold winter day when he greeted, us. I was not set to meet anyone in particular but I am so glad I met this man. He took us to his desk and talked to us a few minutes about our situation and our plans, asked what I wanted and within 15 minutes he came back. He broke down my station for me but did not send me away.\n\nI am a negative person here folks, of course I was thinking everything had gone to hell and I was just wasting mine and his time, but Mr. Lionel was positive, he said, \"I cannot get you an optima, but I am going to get you in a new car. Trust me. I have the perfect one in mind too. How do you feel about a forte.\" My mind went everywhere but I tried to play the shrewd buyer, I said sure I would be happy to consider if the price is right. And off he went again, another fifteen minutes and back he was to grab his scarf, \"Oh you guys are in for a treat, wait here!\" Five minutes later I was asked to walk outside and man was I blown away! The Forte was beautiful, I mean pearl white, leather, backup camera, you name it it was in there. I was speechless, he asked what I thought, take a seat, get a feel for it because man this is going to be your car. I know it. I sat in it and never wanted to leave, going from a manual base to this luxury model, you know I almost drooled a little. He asked, \"What do you think, anything you want to change on it?\" The only thing I could think, \"Got it in Grey or Silver!\" He just grinned and said, \"Yeah, I sure do. Wait here.\" Exact same model, color I want, hasn't even been an hour and I am test driving the car I could not be happier with! Then the standard numbers talk goes by, no one likes this part but I will state for full disclosure that I was in the negative over 6k on my old car, I was expecting that I was going to have it a little rough but you know it was not nearly as bad as I thought. The discounts were amazing, in fact I walked away an hour later one of the most satisfied kia customers, keys and paperwork in hand and taking a picture in front of my new vehicle. Thank you so much Mr. Lionel for putting up with all my negativity and fighting for me to get me in this new vehicle. Hell I sat in it all day yesterday just playing with all the new toys and features, you are an amazing salesperson and even more so just an amazing person to help someone like me. Thank you again! We will be seeing you again next year to get her out of that jeep!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My car died during the ice storm, and I HAD to buy a car.  Here are the problems I observed:\n\n1. 12 salesmen standing out front, half of them smoking cigarettes... certainly not illegal, but it just automatically makes any business look really bad fast.  Plus, they obviously overhired, maybe to motivate car sales by putting more hungry vultures on the lot.\n\n2. I dealt first with a guy named Adam.  He was nice enough... the sales manager obviously sensed my hesitation, so he swooped in and began his \"Pushy sales guy\" mode.  At one point when I started to get up and leave because I felt uncomfortable, he told me I promised him I would buy a car from him if the numbers were right for a used model.  I wanted a new car.\n\n3. Don't even bother looking at the prices of Kias online -- when you get there, everything is 5 to 6 thousand dollars more.  See, that's when they offer you the $6,000 trade in on any model.  Then, they'll act as if they're such great guys doing you such a favor.  It's ludicrous.\n\nI went directly to another dealership, found a car I liked at a reasonable price, and drove away happy.

Felt we got ripped off a little and found out they tried to get lending from so many places for the incorrect amount and causes unnecessary credit inquiries. That was annoying to find out weeks after the fact and that they hid it from us. But the big issue is their service. It is impossible to make an appointment for your \"free\" oil changes. When you do arrive they push a pkg that's like $65 so you can get a tire rotation and other crap. Then when you pick about charging that much for the \"free\" oil change they say, they'll take the oil change portion of that off the top like they are doing you a favor. Then they claim you need a new filter or something or other, which they changed at the last oil change 5,000 so I ask how often that's needed and they claim it's needed every 10,000-15,000 not knowing we just had it done the time before. So your free oil change is $75 + when you are done.

It was passed time to get her a new ride.  We did a one stop shop.  We knew Riverchase Kia had awesome deals on their new Kias.  However, this was not the market we were looking for purchase from.  We were after a slightly used but still certifiable new to us SUV.  Teddy met with us.  He asked what we were looking for in a purchase today, and said that he would do his best to keep us from going anywhere else.  Teddy did just that.  We were up front with him on the financials that we had and the monthly payment we need to stay around.  My wife was looking for something older with many more miles, but I wanted to have something that had warranty and miles to a minimum.  Teddy brought us a single option, The Right Option.  A very low mileage Sorento with transferable warranty.  The test drive sold it to my wife, and I signed the line.  We got an extremely well kept Sorento, with a detailed one owner record review by Teddy.  He answered the questions we had and some that he knew we should ask but not know to.  He was easy to work with.  He was knowledgeable  and we are a family with a great ride.  The experience was great, our turn around time for paperwork was minimal, our satisfaction was at the maximum.\nThe entire experience was better than I expected.  They treated us very well.

An for about a year and a half I have been researching the Kia Soul. I first went to the Kia Garderndale,Al but they werent very nice and i felt as if I was in a interview to see if I was good enough for the car. But when I came to Riverchase Kia. Lamar Black meant me  at the door with a smiling face. He knew everything about the car I wanted. He made me feel relaxed when test driving the car. I felt so sure about the car I bought it that day. And still to this day I know that it was the perfect car for me. Thank you Lamar the other dearship made me question my choice but you claried ot for me! Thank you.

Even my 3yr old stated mom you I'm sweating lol lol. The air went out Wednesday Oct 6th.

I got the expression from her as whatever going on with your car you would have to pay, didn't give other options, just basically it's on me. I understand she have to tell me the fee etc.. but my car is only 2yrs old, and at that moment I didn't want to hear about money, I just wanted professionalism and just let me know it will be OK. I just said make me an appointment for Friday and I will come back. I went back Friday morning and spoke with a pleasant young woman by the name of Season. I think that was her name, b/c it was a unique name. She told me the SAME thing the other lady stated but in a different tone, and made me feel as though she cared. She even let me know by the car being new it may be covered under warranty. I told her my husband can get a gauge to ck it etc.. And she said if we do all that then it's still not working then it's likely a issue that will be fix with no out of pocket expense. I took my car back home again, and my husband did ck it Sunday, and the gauge showed Freon in the car, but stated to take it to the professionals. I then took off work Monday and brought my car back and Season's was there also.. I was happy b/c at this point I was just tired of going into circles. She let me know it may be a wait and was honest about it, and the fee again. I waited 2hrs, but I didn't care b/c I wanted my air fix, and to top it off it was under warranty. Anytime you are dealing with something that is a touchy subject about your car, b/c that is your way of survival and also getting around.... you want people to be knowledge of what's going on, and the situation.

I scheduled a service appt online for my Stelvio. I also checked the box for a loaner vehicle. I was scheduled for 4/27/21 for an oil change. Once I checked in I was told by Tom Williams, Manager, that I was not required to have any major services done on this visit but maybe the next time I would need to have my brake fluid flushed. I let him know that I would need a loaner vehicle. His response was, We don\u2019t have any so Johnathan will take you to work. Once I picked up my truck and I was driving off I immediately noticed a different feel to my truck. I just thought it was different because they had done a tire rotation. A few days later I noticed a noise when I braked. It gradually got worse and louder. I called and spoke with Jonathan. I told him about my concerns. He told me it was probably a rock stuck between my rotors and that if it was the brakes my sensors would have let me know it and its probably just a rock but if I brought my truck first thing in the morning it would be a quick and easy fix. He told me they didn\u2019t have any appts available and that they didn\u2019t have any loaner cars for me to drive while they inspected my truck. When I arrived on 5/7 Jonathan stated you are gonna have to leave the truck with us you need new brakes and rotors. I asked why and he said you are metal to metal. So that\u2019s when I immediately started asking what happened when I brought my truck last week, he apologized said the tech just didn\u2019t catch it. I asked what about my sensors, why didn\u2019t they go off, he stated the sensors are on the inside and this was on the outside pad. None, of this was making sense to me. I asked him for a quote for the service to be completed and of course it was approx $700 with a 10% discount. I\u2019m fuming inside by this time bc not only have you all inconvenienced me when I could have had this service done last week, but I was in danger and you lied on my vehicle\u2019s multi point inspection, or maybe you didn\u2019t even do an inspection at all, but now you\u2019re gonna double charge me for labor. I asked him who is the service manager and he stated Tom was. I explained that every time I have come here you all have told me that you do not have loaner vehicles but the last time I was there(for my oil change) he told a customer on the phone \u201coh no worries we\u2019ll put you in something when you get here and you\u2019ll be on your way\u201d. Johnathan replied, \u201cOh that was probably a Maserati owner and he\u2019s gonna put them in a loaner Maserati\u201d. I stated, \u201cso you are telling me that you all hold certain customers to a higher standard because of the type of car they drive\u201d. He stated they don\u2019t have any loaners, and someone could drive me to work. I literally paced the parking lot in disbelief bc of the lower standard of service based on the brand name of the car I drove, the oversight of my right rear brake being completely gone and scrubbing metal to metal, and the fact that over half of the cost for me to have the service done was a charge for labor for some techs that clearly half do their job. People think that it\u2019s a myth that women get mistreated when it comes to their vehicle service but I experienced it first hand. I could have chose to be an irate customer but because I am a black woman I chose to keep my feelings, emotions, and anger inside and take the poor customer service I received. However, I do have a choice in what type of car I drive and what type of customer service I feel I should receive. I was even just considering upgrading my car. I did not feel valued and I don't think they provide the same level of customer service across the board.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891231ed5d9cf5:0xecab1d88df1cefaa"}

Definitely the best car buying experience I\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 I was given a fair price for my trade, and the sales price of my new car was more than fair.\n\nMy salesman, Beau Beggs, made sure I completely understood every single item during the buying process.\u00a0 He is very well versed in all aspects of the Alfa line, and took the time to ensure I understood the operation of all the new car\u2019s systems.\u00a0 From the time I walked in the door, until the time I drove away I never felt pressured or hurried in any way.\u00a0 For the first time, buying a car was actually enjoyable.\u00a0 Thanks Beau!!\n\nNow I get to brag about the service department manager, Tom Williams.\n\nAbout 800 miles later I was driving home from work when my sunroof blew out for no apparent reason.\u00a0 Needless to say,\u00a0it\u00a0kind of freaked me out.\u00a0 I called Tom while I was still on the interstate.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t avoid the problem, didn\u2019t ask a bunch of questions, and even though it was late in the day, he didn\u2019t suggest any other avenue to solve the problem other than to bring them the car.\u00a0 Because the glass was still falling from the sunroof Tom sent a tow truck to pick up the car and ensured the driver wrapped the car to prevent any further damage.\n\nWhen I arrived at\u00a0Birmingham Alfa\u00a0I found out that all the loaner vehicles were out.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t stop Tom from taking care of the situation.\u00a0 He simply put me into a used car (another Alfa with only 2500 miles) until another Alfa loaner vehicle was available about a week later.\u00a0 In the meantime, Tom communicated the issue with Alfa, and made sure they would take care of the problem, and of course they said they would.\u00a0 I was told parts were on order, and Tom would stay in touch with me as repairs progressed, which Tom did because, well... He\u2019s Tom and he\u2019s the best.\n\nWhen the sunroof blew out the glass hit the trunk and the spoiler, causing several paint chips.\u00a0 I knew they would have to touch up the paint, and that the paintwork would cause the value of the car to depreciate, and talked to Tom about it.\u00a0 I knew he would do whatever he could to remedy to problem.\n\nWhat I DIDN\u2019T expect was what happened next.\n\nI received a call from Tom.\u00a0 He had communicated the issue up the food chain, to include Alfa themselves.\u00a0 The Alfa brand very, very rarely has any issues at all, and they were more than a little surprised to hear of this one.... and they definitely wanted to make things right.\n\nBirmingham Alfa, due in no small part to Tom Williams\u2019 leadership and superb customer service, replaced my car.\u00a0 My\u00a0brand new\u00a0car.\u00a0 With another\u00a0brand new\u00a0car.\u00a0 No hassle, no hoops to jump through, no problems at all.\u00a0 In a word:\u00a0 Amazing.\n\nSo.... I say all that to say\u00a0this;\u00a0 If\u00a0you are looking for a new vehicle (or even a used one) I cannot recommend a dealership more highly than Birmingham Alfa Romeo.\u00a0 Go there, find Beau Beggs, buy something.\u00a0 You will not be disappointed.\u00a0 As a matter of\u00a0fact\u00a0you will be pleasantly surprised in the experience.\n\nSooner or\u00a0later\u00a0you\u2019ll need that vehicle serviced.\u00a0 When you do, take it to no one other than Tom Williams. There is no comparison.\u00a0 I have never been so pleased in the caring customer service he has provided.\u00a0 both on my 2017 Alfa that I traded in, and the new one I am currently enjoying.\n\nI don\u2019t know who actually owns Birmingham Alfa, but if you happen to be reading\u00a0this\u00a0I want you to know you\u2019re doing something right.\u00a0 Keep up the good work, and keep your good people like Tom and Beau.\u00a0 People like them are what keep your\u00a0customers\u00a0 coming\u00a0back.\u00a0 I know I\u2019ll be back, and I\u2019ll keep recommending Birmingham Alfa to others.\n\nThank\u00a0you Beau Beggs, Tom Williams, and Birmingham Alfa, for being the exception to the rule.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891231ed5d9cf5:0xecab1d88df1cefaa"}

They then denied fixing it. After arguing back and forth they decided to give $200 towards the repair. Either their mechanics have no clue what they\u2019re doing, or they just don\u2019t care about selling \u201cinspected\u201d vehicles that have problems. Typical dealer with lies and a run around.

I stopped in fort Payne al and had tire balanced and it helped some but to the point before I get to Pennsylvania the backs of both front seats had fell off and a week later tha Ac quits and low and behold today April 22 I had a buddy follow me to my house and when we pull up he asks do you know your truck runs down the road sideways and I was like no. I then followed him down the road to look and sure enough it\u2019s running sideways so I\u2019m sure you can imagine what my view on Cooper Chevrolet is. UPDATE I talked to scott at cooper Chevrolet today April 22 and he said they done an alignment on it before i bought it  and I told him I was going to have it checked out and if the frame was bent they would be hearing from me are a lawyer and he hung up on me. So scott I hope you read this because if the frame is bent it was like that when I bought it from you and if it is I\u2019m gonna have a 4x8 sign made stating how you screw me and all the problems I have with my truck and it will be parked as close to the Cooper Chevrolet dealership as I can possibly get it for everyone to see. Oh yea I just had the CARFAX pulled and it has been wrecked not once but twice on the left side, the side where the wheel sticks out so be on the lookout for it to be parked near your dealership", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88920fbca6b9a815:0xe11e5703f7c1d938"}

Not to mention I had to pay over $300 to have a window door motor replaced within a week. It was January when I bought my car and cold out so I do take some responsibility for not checking the driver window, but they should have know and included that. I didn't even make a fuss about the chip in the windshield. I am irritated at the fact that our dealer, Delano I believe, promised me he would get me my spare key. Saying he knew the previous owner personally. For 6 months, I had called at 2 week intervals inquiring about the key.

Test drove the car and it sold the next day. It was okay because Jen was sure to find me a great quality car instead of just selling me something they wanted to get rid of off the lot, like most dealerships do. I told her what kind of vehicle I was looking for and within the next week she brought back 2 vehicles for me to choose from........  So here's the kicker. I bought this used car \"As is\" That's no warranty nothing. My window was off track and wouldn't roll back up. I told Jen about it and Doug told me to bring it back up there that weekend and I did. They fixed it FREE of charge! They go above and beyond customer service. I had new tires, new floor mats, second set of keys( only because university kia gave me a single key to my vehicle) Sirius XM radio for 90 days. They didn't have to but they did.

I returned Tuesday and had an inspection performed by my mechanic.  I paid full ask however, Suski did address both issues that arose from inspection, which is fair.  I have learned from past experiences, to never buy without a full inspection and Carfax! There are many dishonorable lots in the area.  Sushi's vehicles have clean titles, with a car fax, they make some repairs and many of the cars I test drove come with new tires.  The vehicles have all been trade ins from dealer lots that I have inspected and they are clean and appealing to drive.  You can tell Suski takes pride in the cars they sell.  I had a seamless buying experience and I will definitely consider them in the future.

However, it did and he wanted to either save the car for himself or for someone else. I will NEVER spend a dime here and I will continue to leave bad reviews. We ended up buying from a GREAT dealership in Montgomery (Jack Ingram Used Cars) and I recommend you all buy from the salesman Craig.\n\nAlso, don't quote this trying to call and 'work it out'. Don't ever contact me again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3ea539432e3:0x180be2342ff1bbdb"}

They wanted a ridiculous pricing of $12000 and wouldn't budge at all. Very over priced. King Honda offered a 2012 Honda fit for the exact same price. My credit is around 720 and my payments would have been $400 a month. With $3000 as a down payment, it would only go down to $301 and not including insurance. When I said I couldn't do that and Id have to look else where, they then offered a crazy warranty. Iv never heard of such a warranty, but apparently for $600 one time payment, as long as I owned the car, with $200 deductible Id have \"free\" maintenance. Sounds far fetched but if legit, its amazing.

LONG REVIEW BUT A MUST READ REVIEW.\n\nIf i could give them 0 or even take stars i would. BEST auto sales? Ha more like worst. I bought a 2012 nissan altima from this establishment, 2 months later it blows a head gasket. IM NOT DENYING THE MOTOR RAN HOT, BUT THE TEMP GAUGE NEVER SHOWED THAT IT WAS. But why would you sell a car either knowing that it had mechanical issues, or without doing diagnostic tests (they either knew about the motor problems, or didnt care enough about their customers to see what was wrong with it when someone traded it in) After almost a week of going back and forth over whos responsible for repairs, we agreed that they would do the engine swap free of any labor charges if I paid for the motor. Once i was told repairs would begin shortly i called back frequently to get and update. Jimmy, a sales rep, told me time and time again, \"it'll be ready this week.\" , \"give it till wesnedsay\", \"ill call back today to give you an update\" well jimmy never did, the ONLY updates i ever got were given after i called them repeatedly, or drove across town to go in the office. Well after about 3 and a half weeks being jerked around and told itll be done soon, i went to the office on a day that jimmy happened to be off. After talking to a member of management he informed me they had just started on repairs 2 days ago and it wouldnt be done for a week or so. FYI i was in the middle of a move to FL and stayed in a hotel and rented a car during this time frame which totalled around 2 grand. The car also had a good bit of my own personal property in it. So i decided to go ahead and move to FL, still waiting for my car to be repaired. After a little over a week they call and tell me the car is fixed and ready to be pucked up. So i drive the 4 hours back to auburn, had my bank refinance the car, and had a check for $9400 in my pocket ready to pay them off. When i test drove the car, i could hear a rattling sound from underneath the dash that was at its worst while idling at stops, and when i get back and ask about it they had me pop the hood while they fiddled around with the car (changing gears, accelerating, etc) and i see the motor itself moving, back and forth when he would change gears (its an auto trans but you can slide the shifter over and keep it in a certain gear). So i tell jimmy that he needs to figure out what that sound is being caused by and i want to hear from him the next day. Well good ole jimmy did what he does best and didnt call back. And after a few days of not hearing from them i figured it was time to move on. So i come by today to get all my stuff that was in the car......and its all gone, things of monitary and emotional value. Not only did they throw away all my stuff without a  call, now theyre telling me its going on paper as a repo. HAHAHAHA yeah right they can expect a call from my lawyers here soon. They are THE MOST CROOKED BUSINESS I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF DEALING WITH, IVE GOTTEN BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AT MCDONALD'S. AND I HAVE NEVER FELT SO CHEATED, DISRESPECTED, AND LIED TO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. They will sell you a lemon (POS) and then screw you over when it brakes down. They take advantage of people with poor credit, give them outrageous monthly payments (was responsible for 300 a month on an altima and only 70 of that went to my principal), then repo the car as soon as they can.\n\nSAVE YOURSELF A HEADACHE AND DRIVE RIGHT PASSED \"BEST\" AUTO SALES. DONT EVEN CONSIDER DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM. IF YOU READ THIS AND STILL GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS YOURE JUST AS STUPID AS THEY ARE.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3ea539432e3:0x180be2342ff1bbdb"}

The guys here are very friendly. They treat you well when you go to buy the car. But I would absolutely recommend getting any car in this lot inspected by an independent mechanic before purchasing. We have already had to put $1,700 into the car we bought 3 days ago, just to make it safe to drive. I called Tennessee Wholesale Autos about this and was basically told I overpaid for the services to repair the car. So far we had to get the tires aligned, get new tires (because the ones they put on wore out from misalignment), get a full brake job, resurface rotors, change the lock mechanism because it was broken and we didn\u2019t have a key to the door, change two filters, and a broken intake hose. More details below.\n\nWe were sold a car with low mileage and told it was in \u201cperfect condition mechanically\u201d. It was inspected by their mechanic. I drove 200 miles one way to look at the car. The test drive was fine. The car was not as nice on the inside, but I was fine with that. There were a few little things missing (spare tire, plastic light covers, lock buttons, etc.). I assumed the low price was due to the missing things and the quality of the interior not being great. As I was signing paperwork to buy the car I was told that the key to the car only started the ignition and couldn\u2019t lock the doors. That I needed to go to the Honda dealership so they could cut a key to the door. This should have been a red flag that everything wasn\u2019t on the up and up. But I was naive and bought the car. On the drive home I noticed issues with steering and could tell the car was out of alignment. The next day I took it to Honda for a key and found out that not only was the lock mechanism broken, but they there were several other problems that needed IMMEDIATE attention. I took it to another mechanic for their opinion, they agreed and fixed everything for less.\n\nI will say the car operates fine now, but I want to warn people to get the car inspected, or be prepared to put some money into the car immediately.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862167de51b12a7:0xf8e1398b333eb182"}

I had my 1985 911 Targa shipped out to Birmingham from Oregon this past May.  The car has been in my family since new - purchased in January 1986 - and is all-original.  But it had been in storage at my folks' place for several years.  Not only did the folks at Birmingham Porsche help me coordinate shipping delivery straight to their service department, but they immediately got the car in and did a full PPI on it, and produced a detailed report of everything that needs to be done.  Throughout the process, they gave me multiple different recommended options, and were consistently friendly, courteous, and kind.  For instance, the engine is due for a rebuild.  But I just can't financially swing it right now.  Instead of ANY hint of judgment or pushiness, they were completely understanding, and were like, \"Don't worry AT ALL - just bring it back in when you're ready!\"  :-)  In particular, Rodney and Tracy went out of their way to take phenomenal care of me and my car - treating me throughout as if I was a millionaire owner of a new 918 rather than a UAB Professor with an old 911.  I cannot begin to tell you how much it means to me to have guys who truly LOVE these cars - and are dedicated to taking meticulous care of them - right here in town.  They will be the ONLY ones who handle my \"baby\" from now on.  You can trust your beloved Porsches to them as well!\n\nREVIEW #2:  For some jank reason, Google won't allow you to post MULTIPLE reviews, even if you have multiple EXPERIENCES to share, so I'm doing it this way.  I was driving my 911 around town, and started feeling my right heel slip on my floormat.  If you're an old-school Porsche owner, you immediately know that this can only mean ONE thing: master brake cylinder.  :-(   Sure enough, got home, put my hand on the mat, and it came up shiny and wet.  SAD FACE.  Immediately took it to Porsche Birmingham.  Figured they wouldn't be able to get to it for days, but instead they had it checked out within 24 hours, even though I (obviously) hadn't created an appointment in advance.  Two days later a new master cylinder had been installed.  When I picked up my baby, I was STUNNED to see that the floormat had been STEAM-CLEANED - along with the PASSENGER one as well.  They even DRIED them, prior to my pickup!  It's the little things, people, that speak to quality in service.  When asked about it, both Rodney and Tracy were like, \"We didn't want your mats to be soiled!\"  Exactly: thoughtful, considerate, and meticulous.  A++ Folks.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-R-4RptlePYXBACBdoq5VNLFdezXxU8j87dxF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2_7VWRIdxYRAoV6n2r9bi4O3LxLsxDSvJhU1N=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889117dca6bc5eb:0x58c749fe1353fe82"}

If I am going to spend minimum $500 - $1000 for service/repairs, I expect at least a little bit of respect or a decent customer service. He always has a belittling tone and most disrespectful way of treating me. I don't know if he thinks it's okay to treat me this way because I'm a minority or because I look younger than other customers. I didn't say anything when he forgot that I needed a ride back to work for 30 minutes. I didn't say anything when he forgot to call me when my car was ready. But, when I was trying to figure out a time for a driver to pick me up, Richard nearly yelled at me with the most disrespectful voice saying they cannot give me a ride because they are too busy and the drivers will get overtime.

Most people might go 1 star but for the sake of transparency and benefit of the doubt I'm giving them 3 stars. Don't get me wrong I would recommend this dealership to anybody. Please read along and I'll explain why and maybe future clients/customer can learn from my experience.\nMy sales guy was Bart. And he was excellent. I'll give him 5 stars if I have to rate him alone. Make the story a little shorter, I made an offer to buy their Cayman. Was not accepted nor rejected. After a few days, the listing went down lower than what I offered.\nCalled them immediately and asked them why it was listed lower than my offer. Was told it was a mistake, which was fine by me. Some may think otherwise. The next day Bart called me telling me that they want to maintain the integrity of the company and wanted to offer my the lower listed price instead of my offer. I was ecstatic. They didn't have to do that. They could've  said, it was a mistake but they'll take my first offer. I salute them for that especially Bart who made it happen.\nNow, I sent all my info for financing so I will know what's my APR and I can decide if I'll try my bank here in Florida if I can find a lower rate before I fly to Birmingham to get the car.  Finance manager Katie called me and said my APR was 3.18%. (Btw, my credit score was 821).  I know I heard it right because I made her tell me my monthly payments and wrote it on paper.  I wanted  my monthly payment to be at 550 per month. When I asked what is the payment if I put 13k down payment, it was way lower, around 539 per month, so I asked her what if it's 12k down payment, she said it was 556 per month which is where I wanted to be. Also, I'm sure it was 3.18% because I went and try the autotrader calculator if it's accurate. Put the numbers in including tax and dealers fee and It was very close to what she told me. So I accepted it. She said she's gonna get it ready when I get there. I did not bother going to my bank since I thought 3.18% was about right basing on my research with excellent credit score (821).\nI was picked up from the airport by Lee who was a great guy. Very patient, accommodating and just a very nice person. 10 stars for him if you ask me.\nNow, the surprise, upon signing of papers. The same finance manager I talked to over the phone told me my APR was 4.18%!!! Surprise!!! I told her how did it happen? She said it's been like that. I insisted and reminded her about our conversation over the phone and she offered to take off some extras to lower the payment. So now I'm paying 562 per month with my 13k down payment without extras instead of 539 per month with extras. I could've have walked out but I flew from Florida to Alabama. Also, I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she may have type a wrong number in her computer while she was on the phone with me. Still, the difference between the two APRs is 23 dollars per month x 72 months = I lost 1,656 dollars for a simple \"mistake\". I know It's not a lot of money, but very disappointing if you're expecting something different. It could be an honest mistake. I'll let the reader decide.\nThis is a great company with excellent staffs. I  still recommended them to my friend whom after driving my Cayman want to buy one too. Although,  I advised him to make sure they send him a copy of the APR agreement before flying there so there's no \"mistake\" or surprises.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889117dca6bc5eb:0x58c749fe1353fe82"}

We live 2 hours away and wanted to get as much details via phone before deciding to make the drive. While speaking with the sales manager via phone, we were assured that the vehicle was in tip top shape, excellent condition, and had been detailed, minus one small scratch on the passenger side door that they could buff out and the timing belt which hadn't been replaced (as you can tell by now, that this isn't a brand new vehicle, but it was brand new to us and our budget).  With the great phone call and all the details worked out, we were certain that this was \"The One!\" We set up an appointment and made the 2 hour road trip. We arrived on time and was told that our sales rep wasn't at work yet, so we started working with an alternate, she was pleasant.  Walking over to the vehicle, I noticed right away that this vehicle was NOT in excellent condition by any means, 3 out of the 4 rims were scuffed up pretty bad, and the 1 minor scratch had turned into 3 separate gouges on 3 different locations of the vehicle. We asked if an inspection had been performed and were assured that yes, everything worked. My husband decided to try everything out and we found that the right side blinker wasn't working. By no means was the vehicle detailed or even cleaned, gum was stuck on the side door, a sticky jam substance was on the roof lite and cd's from the previous owner were left in the glove box.  At this point I was deeply disappointed and regretted the 2 hour one way drive but I had my heart set on this particular vehicle. So, I pulled my husband aside and we agreed that if the dealership could fix those things, then we would be willing to move forward. We talked with the sales agent and she said that she completely understood and would go get the manager. During the wait, the original sales rep showed up to work and she then stated they only perform certain things because they strive to be like \"Car Max\".  At this point, I was just ready to hear what the manager said, hoping for a better outcome. The manager arrived and absolutely refused to budge on any of our requests, and basically told us that this wasn't a brand new vehicle, that they weren't doing anything. He had offered to give us $500 off for the timing belt that needed replaced which was actually a $940 part and said that we could use the money for them to buff out the rims instead but that would be it. Then proceeded to tell us that the blinker wasn't a safety issue and they would not be fixing it, nor fixing any of the gouges that were present, nor would the vehicle be cleaned. After listening to what he had to say, I gave him back the keys and we left. (I was so disappointed in not getting the car, and even more disappointed with the customer service).  Needless to say, Tom Williams Porche must only be into customers who are willing to spend the big bucks!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889117dca6bc5eb:0x58c749fe1353fe82"}

We went back into the shop to set up an appointment that ended up being for a whole week later which was excessively long for the possibility of my car getting flooded if it rained. Today after the week had gone by, I took my car in told them my name and that I had an appointment, which they seemed not to even have on their books of me scheduling, asked for my address, phone number, and for the keys. Nearly 2 hours later I finally get a call back from them saying they didn\u2019t have the part in stock, that they hadn\u2019t done any kind of research on what my options were before my appointment (which we agreed they would do), told me they couldn\u2019t get the seal as an individual part but would have to replace the whole sunroof instead, and that if I wanted that done it would be over $700 for it or if not that they would only charge $110 for running their \u201cdiagnostics\u201d. A fee for \u201cDiagnostics\u201d to look at my car for no more than a minute to tell my seal had dry-rotted and needed replacing, really? It ended up being $117.70 after an additional charge of \u201csupplies and/or hazardous waste removal\u201d for a single floor mat, some identifying tags for my car and keys and some receipts. Not to mention there wasn\u2019t a seat cover used despite their own disclosure sign saying they would be using them to slow the spread of coronavirus.

They always take time to explain to me what was done and why they did it. They clearly indicate the wear on each of the car components so that I have a record and can anticipate service that I might need in the future. I went to another Honda location once and they said I needed new brakes. They didn't give me any other reason than the service guy's opinion. I took my car to King Honda and told them that the other place had said I needed new brakes at my next visit. King Honda measured the wear and said it wasn't necessary based on the wear. I was very impressed by the fact that they went by the numbers rather than taking the chance to sell me some brakes that I didn't really need quite yet.

I told the manager that I couldn't do business with him unless he could give me actual prices to compare and that he was competing for my business between a Toyota and Honda dealer to which he replied that he wasn't (strike 3).

Words could never express my appreciation to owner, Mr. Dave King, service manager, Randy Melius, and their bonafide service professionals for their commitment to meeting the needs of their customers!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c132456a45:0x37bab76a5afd1067"}

The vehicle still have 40% life of oil before the next oil change.  Since I live some 900 miles away from Auburn and not sure when is the next time I'll be here.  But I want to get the oil change for my kid before I leave Auburn.  I came in the dealer at 3:30p and since this dealer is the smallest honda car dealer and pretty confusing if you are the first time visiting the service (no sign or direction to the service dept).  At 3:45p, I entered the door to the service counter and saw two man sat by the counter texting on their phone and asking him (buck is the name) if it is ok that I can do a quick oil change.  His replied was \"we are closing at 5:00p and we are wrapping up so no more service for the day\" I told him you have at least 1hr 10min left.  He notch his head but we are closing.\n\nI laughed so hard because this honda service dealer is so much unfriendly and not willing.  How can you show up to work and not working?  Something is really wrong here.\n\nI am writing to share my bad experience at \"king honda service dept\" so reader out there to save your time, energy and money else where you and the service you like other than king honda.\n\nOn my way out I stopped by the front sale office and share my experienced to mr. Randall / GM.  He seems to acknowledge my concerns and took down my contact info.\n\nI took my business to \"Express oil Change\" 3min away from king honda dealer and they really treating me like a real customer.  My fav guys are Michael and Zack.\n\nUPDATES...3/15/2017 @ 5:47p = 4-stars\n========\nI received a phone call from Mr. Dave King (the owner).  He first introduced himself and sincerely apologized to me of his service dept staffs behavior.  I have to give Mr. Dave King a lot of credit to reaching out to me as a upset customer and asked me to come back to his dealer to offer to do oil change if I havent done it (he actually said he would do it him self).  That enough to tell me that he genuinely care.  Instead he offered a certificate of free oil change on our next visit.\n\nI want to thanks Mr. Dave King and Mr Randall for their action and care to their customers.\n\nBecause of these efforts I have decided to move my rating from 1-star to 4-stars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c132456a45:0x37bab76a5afd1067"}

We were charged a higher rate due having to shop out of our home county (no CarMax in our immediate area) and the county where we shopped has a significantly higher rate than our home county.  We were informed they had to collect the higher amount but we could take a paper they provided, have our local tag office fill out the amount for our local office, bring it back in, and they would refund the overage.  That is understandable and reasonable and we appreciated the paperwork being provided.\n\nAfter going to the local tag office I made the drive back over to drop off the paperwork and I thought would receive the overage that day.  I was informed it would have to be processed by the central office but would be handled within approximately 10 business days.  Thirty days after dropping the paperwork off to them I had heard nothing so I called the local office and was informed it should have already been processed, they were sorry, and they would have someone call me within a day or two.  Two business days later I called again and was informed the process could take around 3 MONTHS.\n\nI am currently waiting to hear from the Central Office in Virginia to find out how long they intend to keep the overage.  The site we used did quite well for us in finding the car we were looking for and handling all the paperwork for a cash sale.

They will insist on you using their financing which means you'll get another hit on your credit.

Both minor issues, but in the light of the experience add to the frustration. They list the vehicle as a Toyota Tacoma SR5. At the time I wasn't aware of how to tell the subtle differences between an SR and an SR5...now I do and I feel a bit cheated. I don't understand how that mistake can happen. I noticed it when I put my Vin to register with Toyota. I have the window sticker right here.....Secondly, they did a real bate and switch on me with the financing. I needed the truck for work and decided to try and work with he other finance company directly after the purchase. And Finally they didn't issue me a temporary tag, but some 3 day pass. This shouldn't have been a problem, but they didn't get me my paperwork to register the vehicle for 11 days. I got pulled over and was issued a ticket.

Unfortunately, she is wasn\u2019t the same person to help us with purchasing the vehicle. For that we were assigned someone else.\nShe seemed to work a little slower than the other salespeople, but it wasn\u2019t too bad. It was only a little frustrating because I didn\u2019t expect it to take two hours. Before we showed up for the test drive appointment, I already had as much as I could completed online, the loan was already prepped through another bank, and I even had the insurance quote ready.\nThen the very next day we were having some issues with the radio. I called, scheduled an appointment, and proceeded to wait another 1.5 hours after my appointment time for my car to be taken out of the parking lot to get looked at. After about 15 minutes, they agreed that there was an issue and said that they would have to call me back to schedule the installation after they order and receive a new radio. It\u2019s been 10 days. No one called. I found a work around for the issue and am not interested in calling them again. I\u2019m honestly worried that they could mess it up more and don\u2019t want to risk it. I can\u2019t say that I trust their service.\n\nThen the bank called almost two weeks after purchasing the car. They told us that had been trying to get a hold of carmax, but that they\u2019ve been ignoring them. They called and faxed them on two occasions. I\u2019m sure they emailed as well, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. They called us because they were in need of the paperwork to process the loan and asked us to try and contact carmax ourselves. I was a little frustrated then because I assumed that the initial purchasing process took that long because the girl wanted to make sure it was done properly. Now I\u2019m left wondering what exactly she was doing the whole time. My husband called carmax, and I can\u2019t exactly state what was said,  but they assured us that they would take care of it. Then the bank called again a FEW DAYS after we called carmax to let us know that they finally got a hold of them and are hopeful to receive the paperwork within the next 24-48 hours..\n\nIn theory, the carmax car buying process should be super smooth and simple.

This all happens before I could even drive my car off the lot. I waited 7 days to get my car. About a week later I open the trunk and realize there is primer and over spray everywhere, as you can see in the pictures. This could have been prevented by simply taping it up prior to painting. I called and left a message for the manager two days ago but still haven't received a call back. I've decided I will just take care of the problem on my own.

Their 7 day money back no questions asked return policy and their 90 day limited warranty also gives the peace of mind a customer needs, knowing issues can be resolved if there are any.

I originally picked out a car online that I was preapproved for but once I got to the lot I became more interested in others each time my credit was ran again (even though I was assured it was not being ran additional times).

I came in to test drive a car they had that was the only one around that was similar to the one I wanted, with the intention of having them order what I wanted if I liked it. I was very clear about that from the beginning. The person we'd originally made our appointment with was too busy to meet with us, the two different salesmen we were bounced to spent a combined 20 minutes just looking for the car they had said they'd have pulled around when we got there.  They spent most of the time trying to convince me to settle for the one they had, which was the wrong color (not a huge deal) and a Limited where I was looking for an Ultimate and didn't have any of the specific features I'd picked the Ultimate for (a bigger deal). When they finally agreed that they could order the car I wanted, they tried to convince me to buy it faster, claiming that in the few weeks I was planning to wait until some new payoffs reported on my credit, qualifying me for a 0% interest rate, my trade would decline in value and that I didn't want a 0% interest rate anyway. They kept me another 20 minutes after I said I needed to leave for an appointment, and even had the sales manager come out asking us, \"Why do you hate my car\", to try to convince us to buy the wrong one again. They didn't even pretend to care if I got the car I wanted (even though I'd have been spending more money), they just wanted me to buy whatever they could push off on me right that second. Overall, a terrible experience, and I felt more like a hostage negotiating for my release than a customer.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I bought somewhere else, got exactly the car I wanted, in exactly the time frame I wanted. And despite the salesman's threats that my trade wouldn't be worth what I wanted to get for it if I waited a few weeks, I got $3000 more for it than I'd asked Tameron for.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

She was SO friendly, pleasant, easy going and helpful!\nShe helped me set up a time to come in and look at the cars available.\nWhen we got to the Hyundai dealership at noon, we met with Kevin Dailey.\nMy son and I felt so at ease with him. Kevin was AWESOME!!!\nHe was very friendly, respectful, attentive and knowledgeable.\nHe gave us a great introduction of the Hyundai Elantra SE we wanted. Despite the torrential downpour and flash food warning sirens and crazy scary lightning that day, we enjoyed the test drive with him.\nThe car drove like a dream through all that terrible weather. Kevin did a great job of working to get my monthly car payment rate at a price I felt comfortable with. He also guided me on how to coordinate with my AAA car insurance agent while waiting on financing dept, then he introduced us to Chayse. Chayse also did an exceptional job of getting all my financing paperwork together.He generously provided copies of documents I needed to get my new car\u2019s tag and registration done at the DMV.\nI had no real expectations that day other than to test drive a car.\nMy son and I researched a lot and compared the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra SE. The excellent warranty, and better safety features, more cabin room, and other specs sold us on the Hyundai Elantra SE. Our prior vehicle broke down in February. It has been a tough 3 +months without the ability to go anywhere.\nFrom start to finish we had an incredibly positive experience with everyone at Tameron Hyundai.\nFor us, it\u2019s not just about a car. It\u2019s about our freedom to get out and live life. We are TRULY GRATEFUL for our entire experience!\nKevin also scheduled our first maintenance appointment for November before we even drove off the lot!\nWe were thrilled to hear the warranty is doubled and our maintenance is will be handled at Tameron as well! AMAZING!!!\nAfter driving in our last vehicle for 20 years, I\u2019m SO GLAD we decided to trust our instincts and research about our new Gorgeous Hyundai Elantra and the Tameron Hyundai dealership!

Her service advisor, Brian informed her that the oil leak was coming from the o-ring for the drain plug due to it being cracked. Brian said this is considered a \u201cwear and tear item\u201d and that she should probably get her oil changed since she was due for another one in around another 1k miles.\n\nThis is where my issue begins, I call Brian to get more information and he is immediately defensive when I ask him for the information about what is going on. I asked him why the O ring isn\u2019t just a parts warranty issue, they pull the plug, put a new seal in it, fill it back up with oil and quote a filter IF she wants to put one in since it is close, he mumbled and tried to get his thoughts together and said i may not understand how warranty works. I\u2019ve been a technician for a different brand for 8 years we use the same computer systems as them and parts warranties generally don\u2019t only last a month, regardless Brian was beyond unprofessional in our coversation and within our 20 minute conversation he tells me:\n\n- o rings are a wear and tear item, which if it was replaced during the service, a month ago.. it shouldn\u2019t be \u201cworn\u201d.\n-She didn\u2019t make an appoitment for two weeks prior(we have the paper work that says she did, that they printed out for her today) and so there is no way that his technician could have left it loose or over torqued the plug because it would have been noticed sooner than a month(it was).\n- for all he knows I did this to attempt at getting a free oil change\n- this may be something I (me) would do to a customer but they would never not take the blame if it was their fault.\n- she should start checking her 2018 vehicle for oil leaks every morning just like he does so that next time there is a \u201cfaulty o-ring, that is also a wear and tear item\u201d is noticed within a month.\n- he doesn\u2019t have to speak with me because the car isn\u2019t in my name.\n- there is ZERO management in the building including service manager/director and general manager for me to speak with other than him.\n- and finally he said the oil change had all ready been performed all he did was have his technician do what was approved on the service recommendations which\nHad zero approved items\n\nOver all, the man was beyond unprofessional had a snarky attitude from the beginning and essentially tried to shift blame onto me instead of just making the situation right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

Long story short, my engine had a campaign in effect regarding the software and potential problems that may result from that campaign. And what do you know, due to the result of the malfunction ... my engine had to be replaced. Matt was amazing keeping me updated with the process and even put me in a loaner car until my car was up and running again.

He was on leave and needed to purchase his first car to drive back to his duty station in Virginia. He had very little time and a low budget. Adam was great in spending time with him and showing all the options he had in his price range. When nothing on the lot seem to grab his attention. Adam showed him a Tuscon that had just been traded in and was awaiting service and safety check. He loved it. Tameron made the vehicle a priority in getting it serviced and detailed for him. After we left, we found a small alignment problem on the rear wheel, they had it on the rack the following morning and made the repair. Never was he pressured into a car out of his budget, as a matter of fact they found a way to save our Marine a couple hundred dollars off the \"non-negotiable\" price. Our Marine is back serving his country in Virginia. He sent us a picture yesterday of himself in his Tuscon fishing on weekend liberty while Navy fighter jets practiced over his head!

I live in Nashville, TN and was traveling when I had the problems occur.  Thankfully, my car was repaired at Tameron Hyundai.  When back home in TN, and issues came about with the car, the Service Dept. Mgr, Joe, called the local dealership here and saved me the $175 I was being overcharged.  With his knowledge, and commitment to customer service, he was able to 'shame' the dealer here into charging me correctly for the repairs needed on my Santa Fe.  I highly recommend Tameron Hyundai to anyone needing their car serviced.  I only regret I live too far away to have my vehicle serviced regularly here. o\n\nUpdate on my initial review.  After I was told by the Service Dept. Mgr. Joe that I would receive a refund on the work I had done on my Santa Fe, the refund was never sent.  I did everything he asked me to do to get the refund, but it was not sent.  I trusted that they would follow through on their commitment to me, so I posted the 5 star review on them.  I guess in the future, I will not be so trusting of a business.\n\nIt's a shame that people do not follow through with their promises.\n\nIf I ever do receive the refund, I will gladly update my review of this dealership.

When test driving the car he only let me go around the block, I mean the car didn't even get over 40mph. He did not show me that the car was certified, no car fax, and the price was 2-3 thousand dollars than every website I have looked at about this car. In fact, a brand new Hyundai Accent was listed only a few hundred dollars more than the used 2013 one I was looking at. When bringing this up he told me they were not willing to work with me on the price and when I was going to leave he mentioned that \"Were not the type of people who will call you later and lower the price.\" So I left, then I went down the street and bought a Honda Accord that was a year older, had more miles on it and paid $1,000 more than the price J told me he wouldn't budge on the Accent. Why? Because Billy at Tameron Honda treated me as a serious buyer who was paying cash and needed a car instead of a 20 year old college girl who J hurried out the door thinking I wasn't ready to buy. It pays to be nice to people.....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

I told Joe I was concerned about my safety, and I had a 4 Hour drive back home. He called in his National Award Winning technician, Chris Cochran. Chris took my IONIQ for a test drive, and also checked out the car with his device that identified Car trouble.\nAfter Chris\u2019s Evaluation, he educated me on what I was experiencing in the steering , and how the car is designed to work on the interstate . I felt very comfortable in his confidence and his explanation.\nThe Previous dealership where I had my car serviced in South Alabama did not put enough air of equal portions in the tires, and Joe got a very polite professional technician to make sure the tires work properly inflated.

I\"ll be up front, I made every stupid decision you could buying a used car. The Yukon my wife wanted had a little difficulty starting (that was my first warning sign I failed to heed). When I asked the salesman he just brushed it off as it hadn't been turned on that day (my second warning sign).\n\nWhen we got into the room for negotiations I told him upfront what my requirements were. He then (what I later learned is a typical salesman trick) went to \"argue\" with his boss about giving me the deal I wanted. After a few hours he finally invited me back to his \"bosses\" office to sign the deal.\n\nWhen I sat down to sign, he handed me a stack of papers that I spent some time reviewing. I honestly could not make sense of the numbers. When I started asking him about them he responded, \"I thought we were here to buy a car!\" (my final warning sign I failed to heed). I caved to this high pressure sales tactic and just wanted to get out of there as quick as possible as it had already been 4+ hours. When I finally got my vehicles they said it took so long because they had to \"clean\" them. Worst cleaning job ever.\n\nThe NEXT day the Yukon I bought died in a parking lot. I should have taken it back and got my Expedition back I traded in but I felt like I had to make do with what I bought (besides, I bought the warranty!) Took it to a local repair shop and sure enough the fuel pump needed to be replaced. Lucky for me, I only had to pay the $100 deductible!\n\nLess than a year into owning the vehicle, the transmission went out. Fortunately for me I again ONLY had to pay the $100 deductible to replace the transmission. Little did I know, transmissions tend to go bad again after they go out the first time. About a year later, the transmission went out a second time! That was the final straw, so I traded it in at Driver's Way where I had a MUCH better experience.\n\nNow, my second car I mentioned I bought that same time along with the Yukon ended up having a broken motor mount and the A/C compressor went out less than a year after purchase. Both vehicles were only 3-5 years used and less than 75k miles on them. Maybe I just had terrible luck from Tameron Hyundai but I can't help but feel they knew about these issues and just passed them on to me based on their sales practices.\n\nTameron Hyundai lives by the moto \"Caveat emptor\"...

Then the salesman tells me \"Hey, we got it pretty close.\" No not close at all.\n\nThen was told at 7000 miles I would get a complimentary oil change, rotation and balance by the same salesman. Well guess what? Not so, they said I would have to pay for the balance.\n\nBefore my free oil change, I ran over a small screw and my back left tire was loosing some PSI. Called the dealership and they told me I would have to pay $250 + for a new tire and work. They said they couldn't patch it. So I called 2 other professional tire shops and they laughed when I told them what the dealership told me. I got it fixed for $8 and took less than 10 min. And it's like brand new. No issues.\n\nIf you want to be treated right and not be deceived and lied too, please,  don't come here. Do yourself a favor and find another Chevy dealership.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598273463184, "text": "Hi Jacob, we appreciate you taking the time to give us more details about your experience.

When we arrived, the vehicle we came to see was parked in the front and ready for us to look over and test drive. Michael answered all of our questions and was very helpful. When it was time to complete our sale, Grant already had all of our paperwork done ahead of time, it took about 30 minutesto sign a few things  then walk out the door with our new vehicle.\n\nWe had been looking for a month for a replacement vehicle for me after mine was totaled. I spoke with numerous dealerships within a 150 mike radius of Nashville. There were several times that we drove over an hour out of our way to see one, only to arrive to find the vehicle was NOT at all as described, it was beyond infuriating. Premier Chevrolet was 100% up front and honest from the first phone call. We will absolutely do business with them again, and also recommend them to our friends and family should they be looking for a vehicle.\n\nThank you so very much to Grant and Michael for going above and beyond what I even expected from a car dealership.

Dec.5 for a oil leak, $1000 later I pick it up on Sat. Dec. 9. Only to take it back on Wed. Dec. 13 cause it was still leaking oil worse than when I took it in. Picked it back up late in the evening on the Thurs. Dec. 14th. Well on the Wed. Dec. 27 the motor starts making a knocking noise, I get the owner cell phone number cause its after hours to have him tow it in. It had no oil in it. He tells me he can't get it tonight leave it at Freds he would get it in the morning. I called on the Thurs. Dec. 28th to use a loaner car again to be told one wasn't available. He called on Fri Dec 29 but I was at work & couldn't answer. So I called back on Jan. 2 cause they were closed for the hoilday & was told it's the lifters & they could do a oil change w an additive ($65) to see if it would help but the car was still driveable. He questioned the amount of miles on the car for the month, not sure what that has to do with anything.  So I pick it up about 4:20pm on Tues. Jan 2, motor is skipping as we are waiting to get on 280. I get less than 5 miles & it cuts off. We think timing belt broke, when my fiance asked them earlier that day had they checked the timing, he said it cranks & runs to smooth to be the timing. I called them to come tow it back in again. So I don't hear anything from them Jan 3-5. So my fiance calls at 4pm on Fri Jan 5 (mind you the owner had been calling w updates) only to be told the owner had left for the day & to call back on Mon cause he was now handling my car. So I call today Mon. Jan 8th (they had it now the 3rd-8th) at 9:30am for an update to be told you need a motor. Not sure why he wasn't contacting me to let me know that it needed a motor other than avoiding/putting me off cause they aren't really sure what's wrong with my car. I'm guessing no one there is qualified to figure it out. I've been borrowing cars to have a way to get to work. Didn't have a car today, so I tell him that & how poor the customer service has been. They have had my car 20 days total from Dec. 5 & even today I was told he had no loaner available but his employees drive the cars on the lot all the time. He tells me let's not worry about a loaner car let's worry about getting yours running. Were talking another $3,000-$4,000. Umm NO, I will not give you another dollar of mine. I will give my money to someone who appreciates my business & will not leave me stranded.  In closing I've never had any issues with this car, never had to add 1 ounce of oil between changes the problems started when I took it to McKelvey Chevrolet for the oil leak to be fixed.\n\nI know someone else that was getting oil changes there & they weren't changing the filters but charging for them.
