Last year when I rented a truck and unit online the sales department split the sale; I pick up the truck from 1420 Montgomery Hwy facility and the unit sold to me was this facility.  After, moving my son home from Alabama State University, tired and weary, I decided to go to the unit first to unload his items from college.  It was so many people there and every time a customer complained (People of color) the employees would say, \u201cHe is not available.\u201d  Looking out of the window I noticed a white man running up to the U-Haul vehicle we rented from a half a mile away approach my son sitting in the U-Haul Van yelling, screaming at him, \"Is that my truck?\u201d  I got out of the long line and approach the man and asked him why he was screaming at my son (It was Antonio the manger) and he said, I am the manger looking for one of my vehicles.  Meanwhile a neighbor of mine was moving and demanding to speak with because the U-Haul she rented broke down on the side of the road after leaving the facility and she was told he was unavailable; she was black too.  Antonio put a lock on my storage never notifying me because he said it was the wrong lock and I purchased it from his facility.  I do not have key, nor have he reached out to me.  Calls to the facility always goes into the sales department because the staff is always unavailable.  People of color never rent anything from this facility that is why his employee turn over rate is so high!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197e84af1c55:0xf5fc42f4ad17911e"}

I detailed my experience with them below.....\n\n2015:  I took my vehicle to them to have a trailer hitch installed.  I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.  More should have been done to fix my issues instead of kicking the can down the road until they could say it was out of warranty.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197e84af1c55:0xf5fc42f4ad17911e"}

The first time when I moved to this area I dropped off my UHaul equipment here and a middle aged Army Veteran greeted me and helped with the process of the return.

Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge.

He acknowledged the issue and assured me that he\u2019d be communicating with the manager to improve the facility and work to end vagrancy.\n\nAvoid this place. After one month we moved our RV because the area surrounding our RV unit was filthy. I asked Brent, the manager, to please clean the area when we moved our RV to Storage Sense. He assured me it would be taken care of, but the garbage never was removed. We decided to relocate our RV on the 13th of August due to the trash and the smell, and we showed Brent the photos of the garbage that was never removed. We also asked for the remaining days in August to be refunded to our account. He said that he couldn't do that but that he could refund the entire month and we should expect to see a refund to our checking account in 2-3 days. That never happened so I called to confirm that the refund was in process. Brent said that his district manager, David Warren, was present and he would confirm with him and call me back. I never received a call. I called back twice and asked for David Warren to please call me ... Still no phone call. I have since discovered that this location of Storage Sense has a terrible reputation for trash and mismanagement. If I can post the pictures I took I certainly will so no one else falls for the, \"Oh, that trash must be new\" statement. It wasn't new and my pictures prove that this management doesn't take pride in their company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598041053379, "text": "Hi Clare Purinton, thank you for taking the time to let us know about your recent experience.

I'm not the type to complain (or write these reviews) so I let it go.  The next time I went to the unit they have placed one of their locks on it. Again after hours and no one can be contacted.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...   Finally, at the end of the transaction I thanked him and stretched out my hand and he refused to shake it. Mr. Hall has a chip on his shoulder that needs to be challenged. I remain unhappy with your service. In the past I have rented storage space for 6 months, rented vehicles to move but that business will go elsewhere. I will be needing storage again but another company that can do the job correctly, that doesn't have an attitude that they were doing me a favor by poor quality work...that other company will get my business.

The property is full of spiders. One or two spiders is expected for an outside unit BUT 10+ spiders inside unit is unacceptable for a unit I've only had a couple of months. That shows lack of pest control or even Raid! I have spoken with several employees, multiple times, at this location about pest issue and requested for their DM  (Nathan) to call me which as yet to happen even though they noted in my file several times for him to call me. I've been complaining for weeks. They have also decided to increase the storage rental an extra $22 ( I've only had the unit 6 months and according to the fine print, they can increase every 6 months if they choose to). Employees have openly complained to me about management and company and how they hate working for Public Storage (I have the recordings). Unethical and poor company values. If i was not out of state on a job assignment, i would've moved my property months ago! The ONE star is for the employees who work onsite because they all were helpful even though they have no control or say over any issue. And I wonder if they are offered the people below me some type of incentive for a \"5 star\" review?!? More than likely. Save yourself and your property the stress/insects, and CHOOSE ANOTHER STORAGE COMPANY! ~~~Update~~~ Nathan, DM, finally decided to call me. Ironically. He informed me that they have Orkin pest control which comes monthly and that maybe the location of my unit is why I have a MAJOR spider issue. He refused to provide me w/ a date of last service from Orkin. According to him, it would be too much of an hassle to go through the paperwork to find invoice. Really?!? His advice is that i consider moving allllll my property to a different unit which isn't near trees. Really?!?! Sooooo, after some prompt investigation and people I know, I have a invoice showing where Orkin last serviced the property in Sept. 2015 and this review was written on July 2016....

That is my only issue, but everything else is great and this app is friendly and the area is clean and well secure. I would definitely recommend this place, I just want people to be aware of this late policy. Also they cut off your lock when they charge you the $100 as well, so you will have to replace the look too. I will say their customer service is great though, Far and above almost every other company out there.  I didn't turn in a 30 day notice and they ended up pro writing it for me anyway since I have been a customer for so long I had 3 units. They strive for excellence and I really appreciate that", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554515644021, "text": "Hello.

My grandson graduated high school and was offered a full scholarship at Auburn University. As an average family we made the decision to rent my home and I would move in with my daughter and assist with getting him through college. So I packed up my most precious belongings and searched for a climate controlled unit for myself. The staff were most helpful and assisted me in getting an end unit so that I could get to my things easily if needed. Being a single woman and trusting your entire life being put into storage can be so stressful. However Ashley has been great, her kind words and helpful attitude have made me feel comfortable about leaving my life of independence and helping to write a new chapter in life for my grandson. I certainly hope that IStorage knows what a wonderful employee they have in Ashley. I would not hesitate to recommend this facility to anyone for their storage needs. I still have 2 more years to go before I can once again be independent and I can do that with no worries\nThank you so much Ashley !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286a6c9aad44f:0x78be7047b6726e8a"}

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.  Plus you can get an additional 5% discount if you have a Home Depot credit card.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

The explanation given by the customer service representative Nyrie was, \"We try to tell people not to leave food in their unit. It probably came from another unit.\" Today I went in to close out my account and was told that although I was closing my account out today December 5, 2017 I would be charged until the end of the month. Originally I was told that the amount would be prorated however was later told that they no longer prorate because their competitors do not prorate. I followed up with the district manager Jennifer Sanders and was told that unless I kept my personal lock on the unit they would rent the unit out to someone else although I was charged for the remainder of december, which I must say I find inappropriate.

Wrecked half a day. Asked for a full refund. Asked for the manger and he yelled at me, saying \u201cwe call you when ready\u201d. I asked was it complete and he yelled \u201cdoes it have a hitch on it?\u201d  He didn\u2019t know or care and walked outside to see. I asked for the contact info of his manager.

The only thing that saved the $10,000 worth of stuff we had in our unit was our lock.  The day we moved out I showed management the damage to our lock and I was told I would only have to pay for the week I was in the unit and \"I will have a talk with my security person\".

There\u2019s a massive loading dock and elevator making it easy for personal use or moving company\u2019s to access.\n\nPayments are automatic and Kristy let me know this upfront. Insurance is required and it\u2019s 16$ a month for storage units you value at 3000$ or less.\n\nThank you Kristy!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600986826134, "text": "We appreciate the review, Lilly!

The previous day on the 1st I spoke to the manager on-site.  She was very nice and very customer service friendly.  I spoke about vacating my space so I wouldn\u2019t be charged for another month.  It didn\u2019t seem like a problem, she mentioned coming to get her when I was  finished, and I even made mention that I may not be done that day.  I was told no problem.  I came to the office on the 2nd at 10:00 am, let her know I was out, it swept clean and empty.  I then at that time asked if the auto-debit would still go through on my account as has been done religiously for 2 years, she said yes but that the pro-rates refund amount would be returned in approximately 5-7 days.  Today is a week and a half later, I tried to contact the site, spoke with an extremely rude customer service rep (NOT the on-site staff for clarification), and after with the District Manager Jordan. I was informed that I would not be receiving any money back as the rent is month to month and nothing would be done-however when I moved in I was pro-rated for days then? That it was policy....I fully understand that, I deal with policy every day-I am also have a responsibility to act fairly and not hide beyond policy and take care of my customers.  When I asked specifically (and while in the office ON THE 1st) when I would receive the difference back-that would have been the time to be upfront, transparent and honest about the truth about the intent to not refund the remaining days on my unit.  If I would have not been told a refund was coming I would have stayed the month-and not called regarding my pro-rated refund.  If that wasn\u2019t what I was told why would I be calling? Bottom line here, I moved up the street to Extra Space Storage, rented the same size unit for $18/month.  I was paying Public Storage $89 after 3 increases over 6 mos.  for the same size unit.  At this day in age a simple apology for the miscommunication and an effort to reimburse me something would have been appreciated and seen as compromise, the lack of an attempt to make it right is unacceptable to me.  It\u2019s not the $89 at this point it\u2019s the principal of managing my expectations as a consumer.  Please go up the street to Extra Space Storage, who were very decent about not wanting to steal their customer by the way, business is business.  The pro-rated refund would have been easier at this point instead of a negative google review and friends that also rent there and now will know to relocate.  Hope it was worth it, I do plan to make further calls.  At this point I do want my money over the principal of standing up for myself and what is right.  By the way, I work for a large property management company in town and in 2 other states that I travel, we were using Public Storage on our marketing material for new move-ins to our apartments and giving them this location in just Birmingham.  That will be changing.  Hiding beyond policy is one thing, refusing to see your company miscommunicated and screwed up is another.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922751385a587:0x11a09201c8c5123b"}

My personal things were put in two storage containers 6 years ago by a business that cleaned up our water damaged house.  Five years ago that business we got to do the clean up went out of business and the two containers were taken out of our yard with my belongings and without notice.  I am not allowed to have access to them because I don't have the pin # to the account. Five years ago, we got no help from the local business or main company.  We tried to get everything take care of then and couldn't get in touch with the business that worked originally with us and PODS would only talk to the original business that was no longer in existence.\nSo, skip to a week ago I get a letter that informs me of the amount that is owed on the two pods since 2016 and will be put up for auction at the end of the month.  I am a third party and have tried to work with this company - I called and asked about the letter and was told it was a mistake and I shouldn't have gotten it.  Yet, six years later I am still not allowed to get my families' things that are still in the storage units.  So, I was told that nothing could be done and my things would be sold at an auction on 29th of this month.  So, if I paid the $26,692 that was owed by the other company that contracted with Pods originally, could I get my things with no PIN #?  I would just like some help and it seems like no one cares at this company.  There needs to be some way to work this out.

The facility is very clean and well maintained.  My only complaint has to do with their price increases for no apparent reason.    We have had 3 price rate increases in 1.5 years, going from $130 to $150 to $182 ... I  believe their units are staying full, jacking up the rates in hopes folks will leave and they can rent at higher pricing.  We have been inconvenienced a few times, when they re-did the blacktop, we could not pull anywhere close to units, having to walk & carry, they closed a couple times with no email notice causing us to drive an hour only to find them closed!  I was more inline thinking we should get a credit for inconvenience.  We will be checking other locations/ as there are several new going up in the area but only because of price.

While I am a college student I wanted a place to store my items to make my appartment a happy livable space. Today I went to store 8477 and met a very lovely associate named April Goodman and while  I was there she treated me not only as a customer, but it welt like during the our time felt like family. When I asked to see the 5' by 7' we looked at the unit and it was not something i was looking for. However when she suggested a 5' by 15' we needed to walk to the very far building on the property to view the unit. Ms. April recommended the golf cart. I told her we did not need to use it since it is a beautiful day out and it would be a nice walk to get exercise. As walking down I told her I might not like the 15' size and asked about the 5' by 8' and that it was the last one available and that we needed to walk back to the main building to see it. As we were walking to the last building she asked if I still wanted to see the 15 footer and I asked her please. When we walked back to the 5 by 8 room I walked in it and i felt in love with the space that it had its own light and also own air vent. I told her it was sold and we went back to the office and did all the paper work and I am now renting a air controlled 5' by 8' and so far I love it. As I was loading my unit an hour ago I loaded a car load in the unit then walked to the office to ask a question. As I opened the door to the office I was looking into the office smiling and as I was walking in Ms. April's office phone rang and Ms. Lechelle in the desk right next to her asked me how can i help you. As I was walking in I did not notice Ms. Lechelle asking me that question. So as I continued walking into the office Ms. Lechelle rudely asked me how may I help you. I asked my question and left the office not happy with the tone she was talking to me in as a paying customer. I do not appresiate that at all. Next time I go to the office to get help I will only make sure that I only ask miss april for help no matter if there are 2 people in the office or if she is off I will only work with her. Overall I love the facility and I would gladly recommend it to my friends and family if they ever need any storage rooms.

They advertise 24 hour camera monitoring but this is not the case. I was notified by the site manager Krystal on Jan 7 2020, asking why did I pay on a unit that was empty. I explained to her that I was at the unit on Dec 26 2019 storing additional items and paid the rent on Jan 2 2020. On the Jan 7th, I went to the unit and sure enough it was empty with no trace of my items in sight. The unit was clean and ready for someone to move in. My lock was missing and had been replaced with a blue lock by the storage facility's site manager. The police were contacted and after the investigation there was footage of me taking items on Dec 26th 2019 but no footage of my items being taken on or before Jan 7 2020. The items taken included a large 60 inch tv (older style), deep freezer and gas grill to name a few. These are heavy items that would take some time to remove and load up from a climate controlled unit in which you must enter a door to gain access to the unit. I am highly disappointed in how the site manager and owner Karmen treated me during the process. I had to request for the rent to be refunded for Jan 2020 and I received no apologies or follow-ups from either of them after the incident.

The man looked up everything and said I was nowhere in the system. I showed him the confirmation and everything that was needed and he said he was sorry, but there was nothing he could do. The manager came out and said that they have not had the climate control storage for over two months now. I told him I have had the unit reserved since February and received no notice that anything was changed. I even called two days ago checking to make sure and the lady said everything was fine. I asked them if they could help me out because I had to find somewhere to put the items because I have to be moved out by noon tomorrow and cannot move into my new place until August 15. They said they could not help me and turned me away. I will never use the company of U-Haul again. There was only one storage unit available in the city of Auburn, and it was at Uncle Bob's storage. The only reason they had it available was because someone cancelled an hour before I called. Thank goodness for that.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2b9070996ed:0x897226dde07c4dad"}

Property manager Phyllis Lucas lives on site, and she runs the business like a well-oiled machine.  Phyllis knows her customers, she knows her business, and she goes above and beyond to make your rental experience go smoothly.   In addition to having a property manager who is great at her job, there are other important considerations.  All storage units are (1) inside units, (2) climate controlled, and (3) ground-level.  There are many security measures in place.  In addition to your lock(s) on your unit, the building entrances by which one accesses the units are locked, and, in turn, the buildings themselves are behind a gated fence which requires entry of a code to open.  There are security cameras all over the property, with the video feeds monitored in the office.  Phyllis and her husband live on-site, and they take a great deal of pride in maintaining the buildings, the landscaping, and the tenant restroom.  Phyllis and her husband love people, and they love their work, and it shows.  I highly recommend Handy Lock on Grelot Road.

The place is located on Hwy. 59 South, just south of Foley on your way to Gulf Shores. What I liked most was the friendly, courteous, and professional service from the manager, Coach Larry Keyes. He was very attentive to our needs and got us in a unit that was just right for what we wanted in a climate controlled storage unit. Coach was very professional in his dealings with us and completely explained how everything worked from the hours to the helpful hints on getting the proper size for our \"stuff.\" I also liked  how clean the entire place was and the rolling carts were a lifesaver in getting the heavy boxes we had to put in our unit. We are very pleased with our choice to move from the \"other\" place down the road, just North of where we are now. Additionally, Uncle Bob's has a pretty neat and simple web site you can use to help you remember little things like, when your payment is due. Doesn't hurt to have a little reminder occasionally, you know. Oh, and the Coach is a big time football fan, too.

The management was very nice, respectful, communicated well and was willing to work with me when the moving van showed up. The facility is kept in excellent condition. The security is also excellent including daily checks of each unit by the management. Automated billing is offered and works well. A worry free experience. You can tell a lot about a place during the move-in and move-out processes. This place is the best. I also learned that the humidity in the Madison Alabama area is not good for cardboard boxes. Stacked cardboard boxes began to fail over time. I do recommend the tough storage tote bins from Home Depot. They hold up well and can be stacked to the ceiling. You can seal the tote bins with Ty-wraps and large moving companies will take them without an issue. The plastic tote bins also do well if it decides to rain on moving day like it did on mine. Of course, I always recommend being a good steward of the rental space keeping it clean and reporting any issues (none for me). Although not required, I always set aside a broom and dust pan and sweep out the unit to leave it as I found it or better.

She showed me 2 units and of those I picked the 10x10. Her patience was sooo appreciated this was my first time actually renting a storage unit and her attention to detail making sure I was happy with the space , price, and location of my unit made me feel like she wanted my business. I recommend Life Storage to anyone looking for a friendly well educated staff. Sonya was my initial first contact but I've been back since then and there are 2 other female employees there that are just as awesome and friendly.

All I was offered was to contact the other location tomorrow at 12pm to see if the manager can get one smh!!

My story goes like this.  Ordered 2 PODS and realized the day of loading that I was going to need another one.  I called PODS and requested a new container and the call lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes.  I also scheduled the pickup for all the PODS after loaded and was assured all three would be stored in Montgomery, AL, which would be the closest storage facility that would deliver to my new address in Auburn, AL.  The technician told me to just call about three days before I needed them delivered to the new address and there wouldn\u2019t be any issue.  There was a big issue.  They didn\u2019t store my PODS in Montgomery, they stored them in Birmingham and claimed they needed five days for transit and three day for logistics.  I spoke to three or four supervisors and nobody could do anything to get my PODS on the day I requested.  They did say that if my PODS would have been stored in Montgomery like they said there would not have been any issue.  THEIR FAULT! So they put in an account review and some guy called and stated they lost the 2:15 min call I had with them.  He credited my account $100 dollars and said basically take it or leave it and he didn\u2019t have to give me anything.  So I accepted I was getting my PODS on the earliest date they said.  I moved my entire family down the day prior because all three PODS were scheduled to be delivered.  They only delivered two of the three and stated the other one was never scheduled.  I asked if someone could just please contact the Birmingham facility and see if they can make an exception and deliver it the next day but was met with the standard \u201cthat is not our policy or procedure\u201d.  I had to drive my family back to my parent\u2019s house to stay with them for another week because the one POD they didn\u2019t send is the one with all of our furniture.  It is taking them nine additional days to deliver my last POD and I\u2019m having to take more vacation time off to unload it.  They also charged me for and extra month of storage because due to their mistake the PODS were in storage for more than 30 days and they don\u2019t prorate monthly storage fees.  I will never use this company again.  They have ONE job, to deliver/store PODS and they can\u2019t even do that right.  WHEN they make a mistake, and they will, they will not fix it.  They will tell you to submit and account review and someone will get back to you in 3-5 days.  Not one time did I call them and spend less than an hour on the phone.  If you ask for a supervisor, they put you on hold for half hour and then come back on stating they are busy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f1fb1cb8e33:0x27a0a5ff6fe82e95"}

Every other word out of her mouth is sweet heart or sweetie.  Its really fake!  She couldn't even take my payment.   I ship and pay for federal express several times a month here and now I have learned I have to go somewhere else for fedex.  Closest location is in hoover and quite a drive.  One of the reasons I chose Cool Box Private storage is because of their federal express shipping services. New manager couldn't even tell me what size storage unit I would need because she doesn't understand the concept of the storage industry. Also couldn't tell me what all would fit on the truck.  If you get a unit you only get their free box truck for 4 hours and then you have to pay per hour over that.  Lots of hidden fees here as well.  There is a fee for application, they make you buy their insurance and make it pain in the butt to prove you have your own, they make you buy their lock as well. By the time all is said and done you are paying about 50 bucks more than the price for the unit.  This is a greedy company.  I plan on moving out at the end of the month.  Still very clean and secure here, but the price is simply not worth it.  No fedex service is a major inconvenience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889244cd0c99bbd:0x75ee32e50a2da461"}

On both days I checked my account balance. It was $0.00.\nSix days later I received a text message advising me to pay my bill to avoid late fees. I logon the SAME day to make my payment and see that I've ALREADY been charged a late fee. In other words, they give you five days out of 30 during which to pay your bill without avoiding a late fee.\n\nOh, also, apparently there's a door in the back that always remains open and unlocked next to a fence that's about 3 feet high so all of their security systems either don't work when they should or do work when the shouldn't.\n- the exit gate that has worked 2 weeks out of 4 months I've been there\n- I've been given 4 gate codes which have been turned off without warning or notification\n- There's no CERTAIN number of days during which the property manager is required to remove the lockout on your storage unit if you don't pay your bill within those 5 days. It certainly ISN'T the SAME or NEXT day which would be the case if there were an attendant. But then if there were an attendant that back door probably wouldn't remain open and unlocked.\n\nThe first night I got there I will admit the customer service agent was pretty helpful getting me into the unit since neither the gate code I was given or the building code worked for me. They were able to get me inside after a couple calls and they were nice enough so kudos for that.\n\nI think this is the only company I've ever had to deal with that doesn't send you a bill before they send you a late charge. Red Dot conveniently reminds you of your monthly payment...the same day they charge you the late fee. I've never received an invoice or payment reminder prior to the late notice which I receive via text message and email.\n\nI've also received text messages telling me when the gate will be closed for holidays and stuff. The message I'm getting is they want you to know when you can't get to your stuff and they want you to know once they've charged you a late fee but don't want to notify you when your bill should be paid on time. No worries, I've set a reminder of my own so sorry, you'll have to do without the extra $10 you've been accustomed to receiving.\n\nThe exit gate has been broken for almost 2 months. For a while it would still open automatically when you drove up to it but it could still be pulled or pushed open from either side. Now there's just a big chain around it. They could probably have had it repaired for the amount they've charged me in late fees but they're probably too busy slapping red pad locks on units they've yet to send out a late notice on.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb4b797cd74c5:0x6014f12e5009bb8f"}

We were quoted a fair price for the storage unit. We were also told that if we presented proof of our homeowners insurance (which we did) that we would avoid paying their monthly warranty fee. Well, I was unable to pay my first bill online because their website wasn't cooperating. I called and had them email my account info to me again. Still didn't work. So I called and asked if I could pay over the phone without having to pay the customer service fee they usually assess for phone payments. The lady agreed, which was great, but guess what was also included on the bill...the warranty fee!  I really didn't notice until I received the invoice for the following month, and wouldn't you know it, there is that warranty fee again! So I called the iStorage location to get it cleared up. She removed the warranty fee from the upcoming bill, but refused to credit my account for the prior month's overpayment because I paid over the phone! The way I see it, that type of behavior is, at the very least, wildly unethical, and may even be criminal.\n\nEdit/Update: I just received a call from a nice lady from iStorage.  She apologized for the error and credited my account.  I'm still dissatisfied with the individuals at the Central Parkway location for their actions, but I'm relieved that someone from iStorage (corporate, I'm guessing) had enough integrity to make things right.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1490024205835, "text": "Hello, Mr. Ferguson, I hope we were able to resolve this issue to your satisfaction.

I confirmed my lease was ended twice with a public storage employee and that I did not need to do anything else, I was payed up, and they proceeded to pass off my \"bill\" for another month to a debt collector. Lower management was initially helpful and confirmed that I did indeed vacate long before they said I did, and he was going to fix the issue, but then he saw it had gone to collections and there was nothing he could do with that. So he gave me the contact information for management out of Birmingham, and they never returned my calls. She answered once and the call dropped or something? And I could never get her to answer again. My fiance and I used their advertised discounts on our first two months, and ended the lease before the outrageous increase on rent the third month. We couldn't afford their regular rates. What I do know is that the company did yet again refuse to correct their mistake when I refuted the charge with the debt collector. My next step will be to pursue legal action if I can. Hopefully I do have enough proof that I did reach out and end my lease. They have hurt my credit and charged me for a space that I cancelled. Their discounts in the beginning are nice, but they will absolutely charge you for whatever they decide to. When you cancel your lease, they might simply just have \"forgotten to write it down\" and then refuse to fix it. I wish I could press charges.

I have also had storage units for over 25 years and in all sizes, shapes, and locations. This facility in little old Florence is by far the absolute best experience I have ever had. Not only with the storage units (clean, well lit, safe, 24 hour access), but also in that this location is a U-haul renter. I have rented 10 foot, 15 foot, and 26 foot trucks with ease multiple times from these nice folks in my two years here in Florence. Also, I have taken two 12 foot trailers and a 26 foot truck on one-way adventures. Every time the equipment is ready and the service is super fast. Alex the on-site manager is by far the nicest and most accommodating employee I have ever met at a place like this. It is always a pleasure to go in and see him. Leah, his competent co-worker, is equally as pleasant and adept at getting the job done for the customer with ease. I really can\u2019t speak highly enough about the staff at this fantastic location.

I found my 10X30 unit (with the assist. of 2 gentlemen who were there working in their unit), which was inside a hallway when it was advertised as outside entrance. The unit has 3 doors. One with a lock on it /no key, one door that functions, and one door my husband will need a crowbar to push up to meet the  latch so we can lock it. We will not be able to open 2 of the 3 doors.  Inside there are 3 lights of which NONE work. Again my husband will need to change out the bulbs so we may see.   The hall the unit is off of is very narrow and I'm concerned it may be difficult to move some things in and out. I would change Storage companies but it is very difficult to get the deposit back, if at all.  The online reviews were deceiving as well as the pictures used.

And have been locked out 3 times, even though our payment was current. And surprise, surprise it was a Sunday and they are closed. So we couldn't access our storage unit. The first time, the office decided we needed to change or pin bc the code they gave us was to easy to access the unit for others. Which I completely understand, but they didn't even call us, just locked us out. The second time, the new owners had taken over and decided we needed to update or CC agreement (we needed to sign it) so we got locked out again.. the third and final time they locked us out bc the cc was expired. I WENT IN AND SIGNED A NEW CC FORM IN JANUARY, THEY CHARGED US IN FEBRUARY AND THEN LOCKED US OUT ON MARCH. MAKES NO SENSE!!! My husband had taken off the day to have all of our stuff from our shed at home  moved to this storage shed.  And he couldn't bc they had locked us out. And I would also like to add. The March payment was due on the 1st.. so even if they didn't have an updated card on file, which they did, I still had the entire day to pay it. So i called the office this am to see what happened and the lady in the office says \"oh the card was expired.\" I told her I had came in and filled one out in January, and was charged February so there's no way that's possible. She then says I'm not sure why that didn't work. Really. So me being inconvenienced and my husband missing an entire work day is ok. Whatever. We are finding somewhere better that will actually allow us to access or stuff when we need to!

The guy there knows that i pay the bill.  I've never been called for a late bill and as I live in her house now to provide her care, i would know if she had been called. It's never been late.   Now they are calling and harrassing her for money because a LATE fee will be added on TOMORROW.  I tried to call Yesterday and NO ONE would answer.  I've paid it on the 5th of EVERY month since I've been paying the bills and I get a woman....(always been a very nice man in the past) who is a witch and says she is the manager.  I became angry with her and asked her what I needed to do to close agreement out as I was going to come get my things out of the unit.  She said my mother in law would have to come there to do it.  She KNOWS my mother in law is bed ridden and can't handle the account.  I even got my mother in olaw to tell her she could discuss the account with me...........she insists that SHE has to come by to sign off on the contract.  She advised my mother in law that she set her up on AUTO PAY.  I promise you I will have a new Debit card and I dare her to try to charge anything on this account.  They won't get one more dime out of me!!!\n\nSince I can't respond to the response I received on this.....I will say that My husband IS ON THE LEASE.  It is HIS belongings.

There are several issues.\n\nWe were recently charged a late fee of $10.  Not really a big deal. There are some HUGE issues with this and what they are trying to do.  Got paid on 10/31 & paid my bills through Wells Fargo bill pay.  Payment went out on 11/1.  Iron Guard called to say that it was a day late & that we owed $10 even though they had the $150 payment in hand. Again not really a big deal.  BUT, they said they will not process the $150 that we paid until we paid the $10 late fee.  The reason for this is that they can then charge us another $40 late fee if we don't pay the $10 in a week.\n\nA ton of issues with this. How can they not process the $150? If we owe $10 for it being a day late, fine. But they will literally charge us $40 on the extra $10 we owe while giving us one week to settle that! That is flat out extortion & I have no idea how that is legal.  Also, how could a $150 payment incur a $50 (10+40) late fee after two week anyways?\n\nNext, they called us to tell us that our $150 was late by a day.\n\nAgain, not really worried up the $10, but ...\nHow do we know that it was actually late?  How do we know that they didn't get the payment on time & they just said they didn't? Or they got it and someone didn't open until the next day or the person that opens bills wasn't out that day?  And we paid it on time like we always do (Oct. 31), it got messed up somewhere in processing (WF, post office, Iron Guard).\n\nBut now, over that $10, that we are not even disputing, they are holding us hostage to get another $40.  What happens if we miss that deadline? Is the next payment $400? Ha.\n\nAfter a couple of months, our rate went up $40 a month.  We were not aware of that.  I am sure it was in the fine print, but really?\n\nNext issue, they FORCE you to buy insurance with their insurance company for $10 a month.  Again, was not aware of that until I got the first bill.  I have had other storage units in the state of Alabama and never had to do that.  That sounds pretty unethical.  I would bet that an attorney could do some digging and find a kickback or an unethical business relationship there. I have no proof, but it sure sounds fishy.  And I can insure an entire house worth of goods with renters insurance for around $10 a month with a reputable insurance company.\n\nLastly, let me contrast my experience with another company just this week - Point Broadband.  My payment was rejected.  My debit card was damaged and I was issued a new card.I forgot to alert Point about the card change.  They sent an email and I got the it resolved with ZERO issues.  This was my fault.  I should have been subjected to a higher rate because I get a discounted rate due to auto withdrawal. But nope, good ole' customer service, something Iron Guard does not currently have.\n\nAgain, I paid my bill. For some reason it took longer than usual to process it.  They can't really prove they didn't have it on time. But I have ZERO issue with paying that late $10 fee. It is what it is. But, they are going to threaten us with another $40? What the heck?? We have paid on time every single month and now are a day late and are going to treat us like that.  And I don't think it is legal what they are doing by refusing to process my $150 I paid so they can then charge us more.  And don't forget the rate increase and mandatory insurance.\n\nThey will be losing our business ASAP & our $150 a month. And heads up Iron Guard, you have empty units now, so it isn't like you are replacing that $150.  All over not just either waving that $10 (would be nice & good customer service- but we weren't even asking that), or just adding the $10 to our next bill and moving on. Hope that hunger for that extra $40 was worth the literal $18,000 you will lose over the next 10 years.\n\nUpdate: We are out! Got another place nearby. Cheaper and climate controlled and found out that our homeowner\u2019s insurance covers our stuff anyways, so Ironguard was stealing $10 from us every month.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578511131169, "text": "Hi Robert, thank you, for, leaving us a review.

I absolutely recommend them to everyone needing storage space!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888906b59d2068fd:0x4ea412b302d15cc8"}
