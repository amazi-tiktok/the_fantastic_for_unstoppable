Because of the RRP she was going through so many surgeries. She had about 38 when she started going to him. Dr. Lee was curious what this virus was that was causing her condition. So unrelated to the allergies he started studying her condition. He came up with a theory that her T and B cells were very low and that she was born that way that is why she could not fight a virus that everyone has in their bodies from birth. He came up with a special formula of different immunizations that targeted boosting these cells. Instead of needing surgery every 6 weeks it went to every 6 months. Within 2 years she was free of RRP. We have never been able to or thought of thanking Dr. Lee for his research and help. But if I could talk to him today I would give him a big hug!

Dothan is open for 4 days and Enterprise is only open on Tuesdays. It makes it much harder for me to get allergy shots when you have to do it on one certain day. Waits are long, the staff got worse and several other things. Although they try to get people in. It's just extremely angering when it's opened 1 time a week in a town with 30,000 residents.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571103096564, "text": "Thanks you for your suggestions.  We have looked at this before, and currently our doctor is the only board certified allergist who comes to Enterprise with a population of 30,000. Dothan's population is 120,000 outside the circle and a city typically has to have a population  of 50,000 to fully support a specialist. Our caring physician comes to Enterprise mainly out of loyalty to military personnel and their dependents since he himself is a former military doctor and decorated war veteran of Desert Storm. Other specialties like cardiology typically come to Enterprise on a limited basis as well. We invite you to come to our Dothan office where there is more flexibility with scheduling shots and visits and we are open there on  Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. We however will keep your suggestions under serious consideration and do appreciate your comments and concerns. Sincerely, AAAPC Staff"}, "gmap_id": "0x88928dbdac15b9df:0xf740e54528e87b22"}

Dr. Robertson performed sinus surgery on me back in 1998. I was having severe miagrane headaches that would last for days.  After surgery I felt 100% better. I was amazed at the result. Also Dr. Robertson does NOT pack your sinuses after surgery. Today I'm still doing great and haven't had any other problems with my sinuses.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917e64c8d3ea7:0xdc28d0f45952accf"}

I originally went in to see him about sinus issues that were making me miserable. He suggested that I undergo allergy testing. I did and my results revealed that I was allergic to 90% of what I was tested for, and I was severely allergic to most of those. I have started Rush Immunology and I look forward to feeling better in the future! Due to my anatomy (as found on CT Scan) Dr. Robertson recommended surgical intervention, and he performed a Septoplasty on me as well as addressed several other sinus-related issues during the procedure. Yes, post-op pn is never fun, but I am hoping to reap the benefits of the surgery in the near future.\nI cannot thank Dr. Robertson enough as he has been so knowledgeable and helpful in explaining exactly what he feels is going on with my allergy and sinus issues. When I first met him, he came in and sat down and took plenty of time speaking with me...even after being in a long day of surgery. He is never rushed in my appts, and spends a good amount of time explaining things. His staff has also been so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable as well. I appreciate Dr. Robertson and his awesome staff more than they will ever know! Thank you ALL so very much!!!\n(*FYI regarding another review below, the blood test used for allergy testing is NOT AT ALL considered to be the most effective at finding accurate results; research this)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917e64c8d3ea7:0xdc28d0f45952accf"}
