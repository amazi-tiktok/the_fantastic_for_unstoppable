Because of this my pain threshold is high so if I say something hurts it really hurts. My previous dental office was aware of this yet the hygienist chose to ignore the pain I was experiencing. After speaking with the office manager I decided I would not complete my appointment and later called back and canceled any further treatment with that practice. I called my insurance company and located the office of a previous dentist that I loved and I am so glad I did. I called Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace and even the interaction over the phone was pleasant. Whitney was able to schedule me an appointment quickly and educated me on the processes and procedures and what to expect. I could hear her smile through the phone. The day of my appointment, the entire staff was absolutely wonderful! As a new patient for the practice I knew I would have paperwork and would probably be there for a while but as soon as I finished my paperwork my hygienist was waiting for me. Chelsey greeted me with smiling eyes (she had on her mask), explained the process in depth and after reviewing my x-rays she recommended the best next step to help with my issues. She listened and made sure to understand what I was experiencing and throughout my appointment she made sure the process was not causing too much pain. With tender swollen gums pain is to be expected however if the hygienist knows what they are doing the patient will experience minimal pain. Chelsey knows what she is doing! She took a potentially mouth throbbing, tears running uncomfortable situation and made it a pleasant and educational experience. I went in with my mouth feeling awful and because of what Chelsey did my teeth feel so much better. Because I am a cancer warrior my teeth and gums have gone through some major changes. Chemo, radiation and long term medication has caused damage that I thought was going to take radical treatment to repair but Chelsey explained how to minimize further damage and what to do to get me on a path of recovery. She was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace, you will not be disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621012488256, "text": "Wow to that wonderful review!

They use Transworld System collection agency when Tonya makes a mistake with your treatment plan and tells you your insurance will pay half and you pay the other half ($560) and then it turns out TONYA read it wrong but expects the patient to pay for her mistake you will get turned over to a collection agency! I liked Dr. Bentley and was very disappointed she let her office manager get away with dirty office practices, so I had no other choice but to find another dentist for my son and I. Tonya wouldn\u2019t let me speak to Dr. Bentley she twisted what happened to fit her narrative and let Dr.Bentley think they were doing me a favor by cutting the bill in half when all along Tonya knows this is on her! And she sent a $240 bill to collections on a procedure that wasn\u2019t even done correctly (we were told my son didn\u2019t need a crown turns out he did but because of Tonyas error reading our policy which is her job by the way we never went back to Dr.Bentley after getting a $500 bill in the mail no phone call Tonya knew I would be upset and she knew exactly what she told me) and the tooth had to be extracted after all of that! So NO  I do not recommend you go there! Not because of Dr. Bentley but because you cannot trust Tonya to do your insurance and billing correctly! Do you have an extra $1000.00  laying around when you get a surprise bill from Tonya? When I asked Tonya why she didn\u2019t catch that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover that procedure she said to me well neither did you! Wow!! Tonya claimed to have gotten an approval for the procedure when all along root canals weren\u2019t covered within the first year of coverage (so that was a lie to cover her mistake) I would have thought an office manager and the person who is supposed to verify insurance would check that first thing!

As a courtesy we strive to help our patients by handling all the dental billing rather than collecting all payments up front for procedures creating the hassle for the patient to handle all billing to his or her own insurance.  It's a partnership where we rely on what the insurance provides us and what the insurance provides to the patient about their own coverage.

I informed them that cold water really hurts my teeth and dentist said, \"Really nothing I can do about it unless I numb your mouth.\"  In addition, I told both that it does not feel numb where you put the shots..most dentists would probably give you another shot to help..not this one (wasn't even offered anesthesia)...of course they sprayed cold water in my mouth and I jumped you may need to know...dentist says I can't do anything if you jump to which I replied \"That is why I told you prior to starting about what you may need to know!\" Sprayed cold water in mouth and it sprayed all over my face no goggles and never wiped off my face.  Dentist went back and forth with me on why I was telling him anything about cold water or numbness..after getting through it there was no what to do if I experience pain afterwards, wife had to go back in and ask.

Cindy did my cleaning, if you can call it that (bloodbath might be more accurate). The pick kept slipping and gouging my gums and it was extremely painful. According to her, my previous dental hygienists didn't do a thing to remove the plaque from my teeth because she announced that my mouth was in terrible shape, and didn't I know that I was supposed to brush my teeth regularly? When she started in on flossing and waggled her blood-stained fingers in front of my eyes, I got dizzy and started crying.\n\nDr. Peters came in next and said, \"I hear you've been having some trouble! Did you know you're supposed to brush and floss your teeth? You have to be good about it, or else your teeth will end up looking like this...\" at which point he gestured to a horrifying picture mounted on the wall featuring blackened and rotting teeth. He told me that my teeth shouldn't be so bad for someone my age and the cleaning shouldn't be so painful unless I haven't been taking care of them. People, I have been seeing dentists twice a year throughout my entire life, keeping up with my regular cleanings and x-rays, and no dentist has ever been this critical of me. I think Cindy was rough and careless, and defended herself against my crying by saying that I had terrible and highly sensitive teeth, and Dr. Peters took her at her word instead of asking her to leave the room and talking to me alone.\n\nBetween the condescension from both of them and the heavy-handed pick wielding, I will never ever recommend this practice, nor will I ever return there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c63473f0a7:0x3a08d1ab8b3a429e"}

I noticed that the pain was beginning to be a bit unbearable so I called and ask if it was normal and if I could come in. The RECEPTIONIST proceeds to tell me that everything was normal. She\u2019s not a dentist so I called back to schedule an appointment to come in. My appointment was at 4:00. I didn\u2019t even make it to the back until 4:40 after asking if I was forgot about! A heavier set girl in at the front desk said very dry \u201cwell they had to squeeze you in\u201d as if I was a burden or something!   She left for the rest of the day. The other RECEPTIONIST I asked ignored me when I told her I\u2019d been there for 40 min and never even got up to see what was going on Smh! The entire time I\u2019m sitting in the waiting area the vision department was clapping and dancing to music (imagine how that feels to hear loud clapping after having your teeth pulled) VERY unprofessional! I finally was in the back at this point. The assistant that helped me was very nice and patient! I hate the fact that I didn\u2019t get her name but I loved her attitude and how she was willingly trying to help me! I was sent home with antibiotics! The same antibiotics they said they didn\u2019t give after a extraction smh and steroids for my swelling. He also gave me more tabs for pain as if I\u2019m a junky or something or if that was going to make me happy. I\u2019m not going back at all. Thanks but no thanks. On another note!

He started a filling and my son raised his hand and made noises to let him know he could feel it, but the dr kept going and told the nurses \"He's fine.\" Then when my son finally jumped & grabbed his hand, he got aggravated and said to refer us to a pediatric dentist to be sedated. Very rudely made a point to say he wasn't even touching his teeth when he jumped. He didn't even offer to give him another shot or try to comfort him/talk to him about what he was feeling. My son is 11, knows what he can feel & has never had this problem with other dentists. :( I am very disappointed that an office so heavily geared towards children & close to home, has such an impatient & unkind dentist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

You are kept fully aware through every single step of the procedures so much that they are actually teaching you about your teeth. You are encouraged to ask questions along the way so you can fully understand and deepen your learning for proactive care in the future. Rhonda was fantastic at facilitating this. A valuable asset for sure.\n\nThe facility itself is nothing less than cutting edge. So cutting edge that in every attempt they will reduce the total amount of visits and time spent in the chair in total (as they understand going to the dentist is not typically the top of the list for most people). There\u2019s even a screen on the ceiling so, if you wish to, you can watch and see everything that is happening while they explain it.\n\nIt is like being at a 5* hotel- but at a dentist. Not sure I could ever imagine an oxymoron such as this, but Dr. MacBeth and his team have accomplished this. Thank you, congrats, and keep up the great work!\n\n- update 10/4/19\n\nThese guys are not only the best, but consistent! Kathy was always smiling and positive at the at the front desk and made sure everything was totally understood so far as billing and working with the insurance.\nIt was great to catch up with Rhonda again who is so personable and professional in what she does. Thank you!\n\nI had multiple treatments that day - and I was DONE IN 3 hours - including a bunch of fillings and 2 crowns (which they made there and then!) and Shana and Dr MacBeth worked like clockwork to get it done, while having fun at the same time!\nThe next day I often didnt realise I had it all done as my teeth just felt normal - totally not what I expected.

They immediately scheduled an appoint for that same week to do her evaluation.  In that first appointment, Dr. Wilson laid out exactly what needed to be done, gave us a time frame for the work to be completed with cost estimates, and hand made her a set of temporaries that looked better than any of the final crowns from the other dentists we had worked with.  He performed laser dentistry on her gums to give her a bigger smile, used the KOR whitening system to give her a bright white color to her teeth, and put on two new crowns that he gets from a lab in Hollywood, CA.  I can proudly say today that my wife has a beautiful smile that she is so proud of thanks to the work of Dr. Wilson and his staff at Signature Smiles.

I scheduled my appointment with the dental rep and asked what I could expect. She told me to plan to be there about an hour. They would clean, polish and then give me the Sheer Whitening treatments. Wow, I thought, pretty good prize. I proceeded to ask what kind of whitening treatments they used, 5 day strips, ugh, I thought, oh well.\n\nUnfortunately, I arrived for my appointment about 10 minutes late, however, not intentional. The receptionist was a bit unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because I was late. Shortly, a dental assistant came to me with a clip board and 5 pages to fill out. I completed my basic information and soon realized they were wanting more info than was totally necessary to claim a prize. I began scanning over the pages and stopped immediately. They were asking me everything from signing to consent to pay for the charges they would render to me today and insurance could not be filed to authorizing them to obtain my dental records from my current dentist. I proceeded to the receptionist and told her there was obviously a mistake, I was asked to fill out patient paperwork and that I was only there to redeem my gift certificate. She told me to proceed completing the paperwork so that they could keep it on file. I looked at her in disbelief and sat back down placing the pen under the clip. I guess she signaled the assistant who came out and retrieved my paperwork. I waited for over 30 minutes before they called me back. I followed the assistant back to a dental room and she handed me a box of strips and about 5 minutes of instruction. Do you have any questions? I said, \"Are we done?\", she said yes that's it. Hmm, so they led me to believe that the cleaning and polishing were part of my prize when really they were going to bill me for this when they were finished. I guess I didn't fall for their trap. Talk about deceitful, a good reputable business does not do business this way. I will not be back. I will still use my strips, but could have got them at Wal-mart for $12.00. What a joke.

Of course there has always been a nice wait time but we decided to continue going there despite waiting a while to be seen. But this last time really made us change our mind.

I'm shocked, because I had just taken my phone out to return a text from my husband  as he wanted to know how the appointments were going. She would not continue my daughter's appointment until she escorted me out of the area. Now I completely understand businesses asking for cell phones to be turned on silent but to tell me that I cannot use my phone AT ALL is completely absurd! I have taken time from my off day to come to this business to bring my children and you're telling me I have to go to a consultation room just to use my phone.  I have already driven 30 minutes to come from my side of town, I  could have easily changed them to a Dr less than 5 minutes from home and had little to no wait time. In addition to all this, I'm trying to get information on my best friend who is in the ICU and no one knows what's going on because I can't use my phone to get the messages. Someone must have notified the manager because she came to talk, but she wanted to do it around my children and that was not going to happen.

Instead of the dentist stopping after the first shot, asking if I was okay, or even giving me a break to calm down before proceeding with the second one, he completely ignored what had happened & went ahead with the second shot. This was so awful, I still was crying uncontrollably & couldn\u2019t breathe normally. The hygienist was incredibly sweet & rubbed my arm the entire time while comforting me. But throughout the entire procedure the dentist NEVER asked if I was okay after 1) crying & 2) showing anxiety from what was going on. Not even once.\nStill currently in a ton of pain on one side of my face from that injection. I understand that these pains can occur, but when I told the dentist after both injections all he said was \u201cyeah that happens\u201d. This is HORRIBLE bedside manner. Patients should be treated with compassion & consideration for how they are doing during every process and procedure. I felt that I was completely ignored & just an \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you experienced that this time.\u201d Or even being asked if I was okay would have been nicer & made the rest of the appointment easier for me.

I am blown away by the young lady that met with me first to take x-rays. She was so kind and she just really helped me to relax by telling me about how nice and gentle Dr. Chet is with all his patients! Then it's time to meet with Dr. Chet,  he was so kind, professional and thorough. He didn't rush, and he took his time to answer all my questions. He discovered my bite was off and he had to deliver some bad news I have to get some major dental work. But, it has to be done and he is the dentist to do the dental work the correct way and I am at total ease about my upcoming appointment. He is a really nice dentist with an amazing office staff and clinic staff, so if you need a new dentist you should most definitely check out Carmichael Dental Care!

Let me tell you why!\nI have partial dentures and currently experiencing no problems. But, Alison, my hygienist for this visit, after cleaning my teeth, explained to me what I could expect in the near future.\nFirst, she made pictures of the back of my lower gums next to my teeth and partial. As she pointed out, they were very red. Although there was some redness in front, the redness in the back, which was worse, I hadn't been able to see.  Alison asked if I kept my partial in while sleeping at night.  And I do.  She said that was a NO NO....my gums and teeth needed to be free of the appliance so bacteria doesn't form into tooth decay. So I agreed to stop immediately.  Next she asked about \"dry mouth\" which I suffer from . She said this is another cause of tooth decay and she offered some mints for me to try which could replace those I currently and constantly use. I could go on and on.....but one more thing. I have suffered from fever blisters all of my life.  Alison noticed the cracks in the corners of my mouth.  She said she would have the dentist write me a prescription for a cream to treat this \"viral\" condition which should cure this.  Amazingly, when Dr. Chet (sorry, but that's what I have to call him) he brought up EVERYTHING Alison had already been over with me. You know, It's  great to be on the same team!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a6864dfea71:0x7b30669ba35a1b8a"}

We do thank you for your informative feedback, because it helps make us better. We never want to make the same mistake twice. It is unfortunate that one of our dental assistants did not know how long I had been practicing dentistry, and she gave you incorrect information about my years of experience. Please forgive her for misrepresenting this fact which is clearly very important to you. In her defense, it is a little confusing. You see, I am a little older and more mature than others with whom I finished my doctorate training. I had been a civil engineer for 5 years prior to getting into dentistry.\n\nMs. Clute, if you ever have trouble with the dentistry we have provided, please give us the opportunity to make it right. Additionally, if your new dentist wants to see what you had before our restorations were placed, we can always send them your pre-operative photos. We want to assist you any way we can.\n\nAgain, thank you for your feedback.\n\nSincerely,\nChet Swartzentruber, DMD"}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a6864dfea71:0x7b30669ba35a1b8a"}

I looked back at your account, and I think your outstanding balance is $48.\n\nWe were hoping you'd have the chance to come talk with our office manager sometime. We can probably straighten all this out with a face to face meeting.\n\nLastly, our two philosophical pillars are 1.) quality dentistry and 2.) exceptional patient experience.

However, when I first switched to Northcutt, it was because my previous dentist retired.  I was told that a filling I had received needed to be replaced.  I was reluctant, because it wasn't giving me any pain or problems, but I had it replaced.  After the replacement, the dentist said he needed to replace his own work (no charge)  so he did.  Then I started having a lot of pain from the 2nd replacement.  He worked on it a 3rd time.  The last time I went in, he expressed that the whole tooth needed to be crowned - lest I eventually need a full root canal.
