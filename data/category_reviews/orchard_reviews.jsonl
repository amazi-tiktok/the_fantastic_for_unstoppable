I picked 17 pounds of berries in less than 2 hours.  Nice people. Every one was social distancing.  Nice variety of berries to choose from.  You can tell the Zook family are not pushing the berries with a lot of commercial fertilizer because the berries have much more flavor than the ones you get from the grocery store.  Great outdoor activity they welcome families.  Highly reccomend", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88623a52a2423981:0x830a24b341eb9e3d"}
