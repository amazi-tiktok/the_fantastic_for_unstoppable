I called to check on my vehicle later that evening, and Yvonne said that her technician was having a hard time installing the water pump and that they had to charge me an extra hour worth of labor. Who fault is that? I told them no way, so they only charged me the $360 that I was originally quoted. However they did mentioned that my car needed 2 more repairs and quoted me $563 for one and $440 for the other. The $440 repair was for a hose that was damaged while they were changing the pump. The hose cost $40 from the BMW dealership and they said it would be 4 hours of labor, which didn't sound right for a hose. I called 3 other independent shops and was quoted $130 for the same repair parts and labor. The $563 was for a hood latch and cable, the parts at dealer are $80. Yvonne also said it would be 4 hours labor. I called several independent shops and was quoted $200 for parts and labor. I guess 4 is there magic number. When I asked Yvonne to double check those quotes all of a sudden she wasn't able to find the labor rates in the system. How did she come up with those figures initially?

We actually charged less labor to install the water pump than the labor guide prescribes.  We also told you about another coolant leak that you say we caused, but we did not; you also declined that repair.

There I was told that it would be at least three hours to change my tire.  They referred me to this location--8873 Highway 72, Huntsville--several miles away.\n\nUpon entering I was greeted by the General Manager, Tyler Thurmond, who assessed the tire, and notified me that they did not have my tire in stock.  (They did have it in stock at the first place, but they had never checked.)  Tyler told me that it would take an hour and a half to get the tire there, but that once they had it, it could be put on very quickly.\n\nTyler had the delivery of the tire expedited for us, because we mentioned that we had to get up north by a set time.  The entire visit took about 45 minutes, including the delivery of the tire.\n\nThank you so much, Tyler Thurmond, for your exceptional customer service.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.
