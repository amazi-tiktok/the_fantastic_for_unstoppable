The condo was fabulous, the beach was clean, the water was beautiful. We arrived late Fri. evening. Sat. we went out &purchased 4 beach chairs,2 umbrellas & ancors. We hauled it all back to the room that evening.  Sun. morning noticed that everyone left there's on the beach(Sat evening) that Sun. afternoon we left those items on the beach, planning to go pick them up after dinner. We returned between 8:30 & 9pm and went to pick up our things.We were told the city cleans up the beach & they throw everything. We were not advised about that when we checked in. The sign @the desk was at the end of the counter & there was something obstructing our view from where we stood. There were no signs on the way to the beach nor in the elevators stating that. The least the clean up crew could have done is  put the brand new chairs & umbrellas in lost & found. Needless to say that sure ruined a good weeken & lost $150.00 of beach necessities. I think between the town & The Phoenix X we should get reimbursed.  I certainly could not afford to lose that amount of money.

The fine is $5, unless you continue to be late and then your service is cut off, entailing more fines. $5 is almost 10% of my bill (usually), so it seems like an inappropriately high amount for a required service. I have not been able to figure out how to set up auto-pay on my account online, despite having all my other bills set to auto-pay and looking for the option many times. You also can't set up a payment through the online account with your bank online - it is card only. That makes it very inconvenient for a lot of people that do not have cards (mostly poor people, minorities, people who don't have good credit, etc) or do not want to use cards.\n\nIn my opinion it seems like the company wants to fine people since it makes it inconvenient in many ways to pay your bill and only allows for 14 - 15 days to make your payment.\n\nI can fully understand that companies need to pay for their expenses and empathize with the fact that these services cost money, but it would be much better if there was more time allowed to make the payment or if auto-pay or bill pay setup on the water works website through your bank was possible. With this being the only water service provider in the Auburn area, to me it is very unfair since I have NO choice in the matter. I fail to see how this is not exactly like a monopoly which is supposed to be illegal in this country.\n\nI have been fined at least 3 times in the last 6 months alone because I forgot to pay my bill in that short window of time and can't figure out how to set up auto-pay.

People can drive at 50mph on their phones, or blindfolded, because they're rich and entitled. I've stopped shopping here because of the insanity in the parking lot. No one yields to pedestrians, even those of us with children. Huntsville polive just let it happen, every single day.\n\nToday my husband and I wanted to try the new Cajun restaurant in South Huntsville, the Salty Gator. This is another hub of human laziness and stupidity. Locals try to avoid using roadways and the construction traffic, so they drive like mental patients through Lowes/ Sam's Club/ Home Depot and the abandoned mall to Home Depot's right. A large white truck came inches away from me today. He blew through the first stop sign going into the Home Depot South Parkway parking lot, drove diagonally through the lot at about 65 mph, and blew the stop sign facing the cajun restaurant. He came so close to hitting me I was shaking, and lost my appetite. My husband sat with me in the car for a few mintues before we drove home. Driving diagonally through this parking lot seems to be the greatest craze since iphones. People sped through here, one or two a minute, and turned so hard their cars screetched when cutting the corner.\n\nThe first complaint I put in about this issue was not long ago, and the Huntsville police said there was nothing they could do about it. I was shopping at Pet Depot when an old blonde woman in a large black truck (license plate GUN 1) did not stop for my daughter and I as we were ALREADY CROSSING THE STREET. She was on her cell phone and did not notice us.\n\nWhy do you allow this to happen? Someone said the speed bumps had recently been paved. But its to no avail; its the rednecks and the large-truck drivers or construction trucks that swerve diagonally through this lot to avoid speed bumps, traffic and general roadways. Why do you allow this to happen so often? Why? Do you not realize people are terrified of this parking lot becuase of the obverse traffic flow? What is going on here?\n\nThese are major problems for pedestrians. No one is stopping it. I've been extremely dissapointed with the Huntsville police and local government time and time again. Your construction efforts have landed the same group of hard-working people in hours and hours of traffric, day after day, and no one is protecting pedestrians in the most seemingly innocent of environemnts.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b56661de4b5:0xb30b15f3407c48c7"}
