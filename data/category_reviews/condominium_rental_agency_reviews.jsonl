Appears that one of their own property managers left a five-star review.  And four of their five-star reviews come from people with the last name Hayley, same as the owner. (Maybe it's a coincidence!) It's almost funny.\n\nRead through these reviews and you'll notice a trend that explains Hayley's poor ratings everywhere: they start with poor quality and end with scamming you out of your deposit. My pregnant wife and I spent 3+ hours on our hands and knees scrubbing our rental house top to bottom before we moved out. It was far cleaner than when we moved in. We discovered $100+ was kept from our deposit because we \"didn't have it professionally cleaned\" -- which is not even a requirement of the lease. I provided photographic evidence that we cleaned up messes that Hayley had never addressed when we moved in, proving that we left the place cleaner than Hayley did. (See photos below for before and after.) Their lawyer said our photos were selective and that we were \"belittling\" their efforts -- says the person who penalized a pregnant woman for cleaning 3+ hours. Nor did Hayley specify what we failed to clean, much less photographic evidence to prove it. All this to say that Hayley appears to automatically deduct $100+ from deposits for cleaning yet doesn't use that fee to clean the place to their own supposed standards.\n\nThis was just the last of many frustrations. Ants and roaches were present when we moved in. Here too we picked up for Hayley's slack and hired exterminators. Hayley's lease requires tenants to maintain the yard but when we moved in, we discovered the yard filled with bamboo and 1+ foot of pine straw (no wonder there were bugs). We asked Hayley to fix it; they sent a maintenance crew that cut the bamboo and left everything else. I spent all week raking it up.\n\nFinally, the property was quite literally rotting on the outside. (Again, no wonder there were bugs.) The owner clearly was attempting to put as little maintenance into the property as possible. I think Hayley is coasting on the Auburn housing market, but it won't take much for a competitor to pick up their slack.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvN2eQVtoi0SQGAcfy6tyL1GD7aSxMtFDS5nyR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSfYxcEl8eRiaOGP1OssoaPdCvsGHf96xhNusd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvQ7HCQqySLqwzzIj8c6iqas_rXgF4NpKj9L1j=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtSfISquaxR8YozlqLVBOYJ2IUaUhwzaAYLeer=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSw48agcU-r-6MKBgRiTUjkbWGuV3PWYknDcww=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9hJgmOGevlVyoSahL4BQ_deo6QZn3dgaSywZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBklQXQranYZFILQmYpaAMjIxW1vyCfFpNfWYZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzAOK_yUoBfVrwwsLXa9E_3ZhjPWJLrS4lTy7U=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8VVTgat3HNyRvPJzk4vn_CiHKXSqBNHgsBTQA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

The current tenets had four months left on their lease so we had Haley stay on as property manager since we were not living in the area.

We had insurance, if they had informed us how bad the leak and water damage was we would have contacted them to come in. Instead two years later we have reports from an environmental mold specialist ongoing us that the upstairs and room beneath where water leaked is covered in black mold.

Haley was paid to do a job and clearly did not. My guess is because they knew we would not be extending our contract at the end of those four months when our sons moved in.

The size and location weren't bad for the price, and the one time pet fee made having a dog in college actually plausible. Unfortunately, that was pretty much all Hayley got right.\n\nThe yard was always a mess, with massive patches of dead grass and poor irrigation that caused the yard and our sidewalk to flood whenever it rained. There was also an issue where the owner of our property had requested that Hayley not sign anyone to a lease after our first lease ended so that he could sell the property, but Hayley signed us to a second lease anyway. This lead to confusion between us and the owner over whether we would be able to even live there the next year at a point in the year were most properties in town were already taken.\n\nHowever, the worst offense was their predatory security deposit handling. During our second lease, our new owners would visit often and always thanked us for taking such good care of the property. On moving out, we followed Hayley's checkout list in full and left the place better than we found it. Despite all this, instead of getting our security deposit back, we received a bill stating we owed $1600 in damages BEYOND what our security deposit covered.\n\nWe were surprised to hear this based on how we kept the property, so we requested proof of the damages we were being charged for from Hayley. We were told that we would have to schedule an appointment for that, but any subsequent attempts to schedule an appointment were ignored.\n\nFunnily enough, a friend in the same neighborhood who also rented from Hayley received a very similar bill upon moving out and has had the same experience in being ignored.\n\nIt seems as though Hayley's strategy is to scare young tenants out of their security deposits by asking for a ridiculous amount of money and then silently slinking off with an extra month's rent. To make things worse, this money isn't being used to clean or renovate the properties either, if the state of our property when we moved in is any indication.\n\nSo in summary, just avoid this company. Don't be fooled by the reviews here (if you look closely, almost all of the good reviews are years old with no comments and the recent reviews are much more scathing).

I first want to state HMC was very point blank and aggressive and I find them to be unreasonably rude, making use threats and unnecessary means of manipulation to obtain rent EVEN THOUGH I WAS READY AND WILLING TO MAKE A PAMENT. After a recent Identity theft and a severe life threatening illness that left me homebound for several months I was very hesitant to send large amount of money to a company that I had never heard of. All this happened over text message too at that, though they Implied that I(who have had a great rental history prior to my current very difficult landlord) \"Had just been ignoring them and they had been trying to make contact\". All their problems were my fault. They show absolutely no desire and put forward effort to make my rent payment easy to make, just threats. even after the check I wrote them was RETURNED TO ME DUE TO SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. Excuse my language but i didn't even know where the goddam office was. This is an inexpensive company that at the moment appears to care nothing at all about about the well being of their tenants. This is just a personal note, but I can give the impression of that of a low income person in trouble (when in reality that was not the case) and I get the impression that this company has been using the fear and threat of security as a means manipulate their \"less desirable\" clientele regularly for some time now. they seem very practiced. My advice, don't do business with people who use fear as a business model. I will be living my very well enjoyed home to work with a company that values my business and perhaps more importantly, value me as a human worthy of respect.

My daughter lived at this apartment complex for two years. When we got the house assignment before my daughter moved in they had completely changed the type house that my daughter had agreed to rent. Then they said directed me to the place in the least small print where it says they can switch you to any unit they please. There was nothing we could do about it. While we were in the unit the hot water heater was replaced going to a gas hot water heater and because the gas was in my name they charged the hot water heater to my account. It was charged to my gas account and debited out of my checking account, $1800 without my permission. I had to wait three months to be reimbursed and I also had to wait on a coupon from the gas company to be reimbursed. We could not wait to get out of there.\n\n\u2014\u2014I did receive a phone call a few days after posting my review from the corporate office about my negative review. I want to clarify that Spire didn\u2019t charge my account without the On-site management people at Creekside letting the gas company into the home. I nor my daughter was there to let them in and the only people that authorized the charge and transaction was Creekside and Creekside refused to call Spire and correct the problem by billing them or the owner of the condo. Also, the small print indicating they could and did switch the unit that we wanted is a fact and an issue that future tenants need to understand. It makes you realize that they could and did show a nice unit in the style, location, and price and switch you to whatever they want.

This property has the absolute worst management I have ever seen. Clearly they don't train their staff to know anything. Any time my roommate and I had maintenance issues in our apartment, we had to call several times before someone would come out and fix the problem. Our AC in our unit breaks all the time. During graduation weekend it wasn't working and we were going to have several people in our unit celebrating with us. On Saturday, we called and were told maintenance doesn't work on Saturday's and then were told we could call someone not affiliated with Creekside.

{"user_id": "102341625859514885791", "name": "Steve Klein", "time": 1431021117418, "rating": 2.0, "text": "I lived here for three years and figured I'd let people know my thoughts. Some of it is good, some of it is bad, some of it could go either way depending on what you want out of a place to live, and some of it is just unavoidable as it is targeted to college students.\n\nSome aspects of the property are really nice. The clubhouse is pretty nice (though the weight room is a joke; I don't know why any Auburn student would use it instead of the top notch campus facility). The common areas are generally well-maintained. I say generally because while the landscaping is kept up, the gates are not. I've been trying to get my name added to the call box for three years and it still hasn't happened, yet I know residents that moved out years ago still in the list.  The gates are frequently broken and they keep nobody out. If someone wants to get in, they will get in. They will simply wait for someone to open the gate and go in after them. If you are going to be a \"gated community\" then be a gated community. In my opinion, Creekside should just get rid of the gates because they really don't accomplish anything except annoy the residents.\n\nCreekside does not tow. This could be good or bad depending on your point of view. I never had an issue with parking. On busy football weekends, perhaps I'd be 10-12 spots away from my front door but that was about the extent of it. However, other parts of the complex may not have quite as abundant parking so that could be an issue. I'm really not sure. It was nice to not have to deal with visitor passes, etc. but it would be very frustrating if there wasn't enough parking near your home.\n\nCreekside does not enforce many of its own rules. The one that really annoys me is the pool. It is supposed to be limited to residents and residents are allowed two guests I believe. What it ends up being is tons of people who might know one person in Creekside... or in some cases just show up without knowing anyone. I pay good money to live in a place like this and don't feel like my money should be going to clean up after non-residents who break chairs, leave beer cans and bottles strewn about, etc. Some would say I'm a party pooper... but I like to think of it as being irritated by trespassing. People (many times non-residents) bring beer bottles and dogs to the pool routinely... both are supposed to be fineable offenses... but I've never seen one handed out.\n\nMaintenance is a mixed bag, but mainly poor. To get a broken door repaired, it took about a dozen phone calls over a two month period. Simply absurd. I also reported a broken toilet two different times. Once, it was repaired promptly. The other time... I was told they'd be out there \"in the next couple of days\" and nobody ever came. After about a week, I fixed the toilet myself. Also, I should point out that *OWNERS* are occasionally treated as second-class citizens by the on-site management. Essentially, the homeowner's dues should get me the same rights as the renter's... but when I file a maintenance issue that is supposed to be covered by the HOA dues, they handle all renters first... I guess to make sure they get people to resign because they know the homeowner is unlikely to sell because of a small issue like this. Or, in the vast majority of cases, it isn't the actual homeowner who lives in the house; It is often the parent of one of the residents who probably never even hears about the issue.\n\nThe last issue I have is with the TV/Internet Service. It has been nothing short of awful the entire time I've lived here. In 2015, I don't think people can really appreciate just how bad I have had it and what a negative it is. The internet is slow, often less than 1 megabit/second so forget about streaming Netflix during peak hours; You'll be lucky if you can just get a YouTube video to play in 240p, nevermind HD.\n\nAll in all, it is a decent place to live. You could definitely do a lot worse. I think I'd rather pay for a location closer to campus rather than the resort style amenities, but that is personal preference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586452516041, "text": "Thank you for the valuable information"}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3710357e3:0xc8afc14b7cb32308"}

Oftentimes people who come to the pool don\u2019t even know anyone in the complex (I have no idea how they get in). Adding to their being unwelcome is the fact that they, along with actual residents, throw empty beer cans and cigarettes into the pool, making it disgusting and completely unable to be used.\n\nCreekside also advertises itself as a gated community. Unlike other gated complexes, however, Creekside uses a barcode scan system, which is usually broken. Thus the gates are open 24 hours a day, including weekends. If the gates are closed and the scanner is broken, there is no code to open the gates, which led to three broken gates because of cars driving through them in the year that I lived there. Why they chose a system with no backup way to get in is beyond me.\n\nCreekside is a magnet for irresponsible students who love to party loudly. I did not understand how there could be such a high concentration of people with such habits, but then I discovered that much of Creekside\u2019s advertising involves half of drink specials for residents and other alcoholic incitements. There were obnoxiously loud parties that could be heard two rows of houses over and up the street nearly every weekend and even on weekdays. These parties were rampant with underage drinking and lasted until four a.m. or later. The courtesy officer never picks up his phone, so the police usually come. This is an inconvenience and an annoyance for the officers, especially since Creekside hired someone who is supposedly responsible for taking care of such noise disturbances.\n\nThe Internet is abysmal, and it is nearly impossible to get someone to come out and fix it. Our Internet didn\u2019t work for three months, and the management refused to give us a refund on the portion of our rent that went toward cable and Internet.  They also refused to let us get our own router.\n\nManagement threatens to fine its residents constantly, but never follows up; therefore, what looks like a beautiful complex from outside the gates is full of porches that are littered with beer cans, cigarettes, trash, and beer pong tables. Any complaints about the state of the porches will go unnoticed.\n\nAll in all, Creekside is a place for rich kids whose parents don\u2019t care if they drink excessively underage and blow off classes in the morning due to a midweek party. Were I a parent, no matter how much money I had, I would avoid investing in a unit in Creekside like the plague.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586452699657, "text": "Thank you for your feedback on our college student community."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3710357e3:0xc8afc14b7cb32308"}

This includes paying all Association bills, working with and overseeing vendors, answering Owner, Realtor, lender, and closing attorney questions, creating financials statements, reconciling the bank accounts, administering quarterly and annual meetings, etc.  The annual budget is set by the Board of Directors and is then presented to all Owners to vote to ratify at the Annual Members Meeting.  Spaces then operates the Association within that budget for the year.  Spaces provides regular financial statements to the Board, and approved financial statements are available to all Owners.

We cannot speak to how the Association was operated previously, but a primary reason we are hired is to provide covenant enforcement for Associations.  If someone is considering purchasing a home in an Association we manage, they can expect an Association that operates within the budget set by the Board of Directors and ratified by the Members.  They can also expect the restrictive covenants to be enforced in a fair and compassionate way.  We always send a friendly letter for each first time violation to make the owner aware of the covenant violation and provide a timeframe to correct the violation.  This friendly letter results in 95 percent of the violations being corrected.  In the cases where the violation is not corrected, we do have a set policy that is equally enforced to bring the property into compliance.  The majority of violation letters we send are a result of a neighbor reporting the violation to us for enforcement.  By having a set system, it allows neighbors to be neighbors without having to get into demanding compliance with restrictive covenants.  We facilitate that process for the Board and neighbors.

We lived at Traditions Condominiums from February 2016 to February 2017. We were told in December 2016 that we have to sign a lease for fall 2017-2018. If we did not sign it by the end of December, they would start showing the apartment in January. Not sure what we wanted to do, we signed the lease. The apartment was small, no light, smelled horrible from old carpet as well as being a family with 2 teenagers, we were cramped and decided to look for a house to rent until we were ready to build. We found someone to take over the current lease as well as the next years lease. They were not subleasing, rather they were signing a new lease. Spaces Management charged us a fee for breaking the lease as well as a fee for each month. We tried finding this in the contract that we signed and did not find anything. When we called them about it, they told us that we had to submit it all in writing in email format. Even though we had an attorney, they threatened us to pay the fees or they would reassign the tenants that we found to a different apartment and not rent our apartment out. We would be financially responsible each month until our contract ended on their term.

Whenever I was in town or moved out and tried to call them, they never pick up the phone!!! I moved out of town in July then received a bill in September, with a service that I never used. I tried to call several times, never get answered. I also emailed, no answer as well. They are doing a fair job at maintenance.\nAnother thing that happened when I moved out was all the UHauls were gone during that week, so I asked the main office if I could have a grace period for one day. The premise for me to ask this was my roommate is still leasing the apartment, and she has not found the new roommate yet. I assumed, if she agrees, then I should be good. I went to talk to the main office, the front desk told me to talk to the office at the Midtown apartment. I went there, the lady rejected my proposal and said they will have vendors checking my room right on the day I moved out and through my stuff out even if I have my roommate's permission to place them in the living room. So, I ran crazy for that week looking for moving trucks and finally moved out on time (actually two days in advance). I returned the keys and everything to the main office and told my story. Another lady, seems like the manager or some management-level person told me a totally different answer. She said if my roommate is keeping renting the apartment and agree to let me put my stuff in there, I could have the grace period!!! This is nuts! I was so upset for that day but decided to not give a bad review on Google review. This time, I really cannot. It is not about money, it is their attitude.\n\nUpdated\n\nAround an hour than I left the one star review, they responded and someone finally answered the call. The answer I got for the charge is because of the wreath we had on the door\ud83d\ude44\ufe0fso I told them that is not trash, that is what we used to place outside as decoration. Since my roommate is still living in there, it should not count as something I left not as trash. The new manager of the office said she had no other answer for my question other than I have to pay the \u201creasonable\u201d charge. Oh, the most incredible thing for this management company is they will change the detail of the lease without notifying. Since I am moving out of the town and my roommate will stay, she renewed the lease. When we started to lease the apartment, we get told that we are only leasing our own room (we were paired up by the management company), which means we do not have to lease the whole apartment if we cannot find a roommate. After two years of leasing, our contract have never changed. However, they changed it this year without any notification, and my roommate did not look through carefully so she rent the whole apartment. This is the reason why I thought I should be ok to leave my stuff in the apartment with my roommate\u2019s permission. Based on my roommate\u2019s feedback, their maintainance worked as well as the office does. It took them over a month to get the sink fixed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569606837169, "text": "We are sorry that you did not have a good move-out experience.

I waited onsite for another 45 minutes and no one ever returned to the office or answered my ticket. THREE days later I get a phone call from the apartment complex stating they would love to schedule another tour.

I called the number and I was directed the call center and made an appointment. My friend and I sat outside for 45 minutes before someone came back. When Fredricka returned to the office, she was off the rip rude. I was washing my hands at the sink and I guess that is frowned upon at the Haven apartment complex.\nWhen my friend was explaining the purpose of her visit, Ms. Fredricka was not comprehending anything she was saying. Before viewing the apartments, I gave a suggestion to Ms. Fredricka that she should turn the sign around so people can know she is not in the office at the moment. She explained to me that she didn\u2019t turn it around because she was just getting her lunch. Although she was just getting food and not handling business pertaining to the apartments, she should have still turned the sign around so others can know that she is not in the office.\nWe went and viewed the renovated version of the Madison and it was beautiful. One thing that I might add is that the description of the \u201cpatio\u201d should be worded and explained as a balcony because that\u2019s exactly what it is. The bedrooms in this particular unit is not big enough for the price of rent.  Upon our return to the office to view the other unit, there were people standing outside because once again, the sign was not turned around to inform them that she was on a tour. We went to view the classic version of the Hamilton and how Ms. Fredricka explained this unit is not how I envisioned it. This apartment has cream counter tops and appliances and it is not appealing to the eye at all. The cream appliances and grey cabinets make the apartment look real country. The fridge had rust on the side and I asked Ms. Fredricka if they would replace or paint over this rust stain on the refrigerator should my friend move into this unit. Maybe she did not see nor comprehend what I was saying because she said that this apartment comes with cream countertops and appliances. That\u2019s clearly not what I was asking her. I asked the question again and she seemed perplexed as if I was asking if she personally would replace the refrigerator. When she finally comprehended what I was saying, she explained that no one has ever asked that question but she would have to check into that and see. This whole experience, completely turned my friend and I off from ever thinking about renting apartments from here.

The false advertisement of the weight room that\u2019s been under construction since I moved is the start, but most recently is with my utility bill. I\u2019ve been living here for 2 years and my bill has doubled, almost tripled in just one month. After reaching out to the new management about this issue, they told me there was NOTHING they can do and the cost is the cost. They couldn\u2019t give me any explanation as to why the utility bill has changed other than saying each apartment has to pay a share of the entire complex\u2019s usage. It was my understanding in the lease I signed that I was responsible for the water that \u201cI\u201d used. I was told to reach out to American Utility Management (AUM) for further assistance. After doing so, AUM said that it seems like there has been a substantial amount of water being used throughout the complex lately, which makes sense due to the major sewage and water leakage issues and construction that\u2019s been occurring for the past month or so, which adds to the water/sewage usage. Sounds like they\u2019re overcharging us so they can cover the cost of the sewage issues that we don\u2019t have anything to do with. There are other things that concern me as well but I\u2019ll just say that there has to be a better way to handle these situations. I WOULDN\u2019T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.

I was so excited about the price and the location is still great, a littler farther from downtown but the apartment is so worth it! The renovations that Chris did are great, I love the flooring, paint colors, it had new carpeting and the room and closet sizes are great, it also comes with a (very small) dishwasher and a washer/dryer.

I went to Badger Properties because I read good reviews on Google and had heard generally good things from people. I went to the office in person and told Chris \"the badger\" my situation. I was just getting out of a 12 month rehab program, and had been working for a Christian Ministry and looking for an apartment in Auburn since I was a student at Auburn University at the time. I was very up front about my bad credit but was working 7 days a week and had many references etc to back up that I was honest and good for the rent every month. After seeing me alone in his office after hours, and asking me to come along (still alone) with him to see one of the properties (still after hours) I agreed because I was desperately in need of an apartment. He took me to an apartment to collect rent from a girl around my age, then he took me to another apartment where he basically showed me a place and then just sort of \"visited\" with some tenants. Every one seemed to like him, the apartments were pretty nice for how old they are, regardless, I was impressed at the time. We then went back to his office (once again, all happening after business hours) and he gave me an application, but before he did that he sat me down in the seating area of his office. We were completely alone and it was very dimly lit, and the front door was locked. He asked me extremely probing and personal questions about my past drug use. Mind you, I was sober for over a year at this point, active in church (still am) and admittedly hadn't even smoked a cigarette in over a year. He asked me questions like, \"So what led you to do drugs?\" \"what kind of drugs have you tried?\" \"how did you do your drugs? did you shoot up? snort them?\" He just kept asking SO many invasive and frankly, inappropriate questions; it was almost sadistic. I answered them as honestly as possible without divulging too much, because I really needed an apartment, I was impressed by the ones he had shown me and I thought that being as honest as I could would show him that I was a good tenant despite my bad credit, etc. After filling out an application and getting my credit checked through the program he said he uses to run credit (which gave a very vague summary of ones credit) I went back to his office once I had submitted my credit report and application. He said he didn't think he could rent to me because my credit report showed that I was $25k in debt; I explained that those were my student loans and that the program he uses wasn't showing exactly WHAT the debt was, just the amount. He said he couldn't rent to someone who was that far in debt. I explained that I am a student and that those are my student loans. I said, I would get a more in depth credit report and bring it to him. He gave me back my money order with the application fee on it and said to come back with a new credit report. My aunt is a real estate agent and she ran my credit for me, this time I had a complete credit report with every single student loan showing in detail, but because I had now ran my credit twice in one week, my already poor credit score was even lower. Despite that I went back to \"the badger\" and told him that the large amount of \"debt\" he saw was indeed my student loans, which were not even in collection because I was still attending Auburn at the time. He said then said he couldn't rent to someone with a credit score as low as mine and with a history like mine (due to my past drug use I had a criminal record. I have not had a single run in with the law in almost 4 years). So all in all, after wasting time, money, energy and being thoroughly humiliated, I would say that Badger Properties only serves those they deem worthy, and they don't believe in giving people second chances, only sadistically probing and dissecting the past of people who have made mistakes despite turning their lives around. A huge waste of time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459895750596, "text": "After 15 years of running Badger Homes and Badger Properties, I stand by my record of treating all applicants fairly in terms of their qualifications for an apartment.  They area 1) Credit score, from a tenant or direct relative, 2) Academic progress, and 3) good references from their previous landlord.  As stated above, our screening reports DO only show a credit score, they do not show a full report - meaning, we don't know the type of debt.  Our screening criteria is designed to approve or deny based on the SCORE, regardless of the type of debt.\n\nIf this dispute ever got serious, *I could produce a chain of emails which would explain and clearly show the reason for Denial*.  There was never any \"trade\" or \"back door\" approval process offered, and their never has been since I started the business.  We document every case of approval or denial, so we are ready to defend against accusations such as these.  That is not how we operate.  To have one negative review in 15 years should be evidence of how we do things.  Are we perfect?  No.  But we don't run the kind of business we are being accused of in the allegations above.\n\nOn the rehab comment: I can confidently say that we have rented to people coming from / still in rehab programs.  We have also rented to gay, straight, and many different religions and ethnic backgrounds, as well as singles, married couples, singles with kids, and families.  We have rented to people with low credit scores, also, but they must have a direct relative with a qualifying score be screened and sign as a Guarantor for their lease.  Our records are clear on that as well.  The \"second score\" that was brought to me to qualify was well below our minimum qualification.  We require a 650, the score presented was well below 600.\n\nAs stated above, there was not a qualifying score, and possibly not the required academic progress - but maybe\nshe met that qualification, I honestly do not recall.  We do not search any Applicant's criminal record, only our employees.\n\nAs stated above, I DID refund the Application Fee, and provide a true explanation of the reason for denial.  I do not remember asking questions about shooting or snorting drugs - I don't even know enough about drugs to know what that would mean anyway.  I have never even had a beer in my life, which everyone I've known for 41 years can verify.\n\nAfter hours, most (not all) of the lights are off in our storefront office, and the door is usually locked, but it is a full glass storefront on a busy street full of shoppers - so hardly a threatening or scary place.  I admit I probably asked questions that I didn't officially need to ask, true.  I am sorry if doing so had a worse impact than I expected.\n\nI do remember that the reviewer above and I did go to see an apartment and collect rent from a neighbor, but in most cases our rent is paid online, and has been for years.  I always thought that giving tours after hours and visiting with tenants after hours was a sign of good customer service, not something I would have to defend later.\n\nIf an independent auditor surveyed all of our current and previous tenants - male and female - over the last 15 years, they would come up with a conclusion that we are a little slow on maintenance, tough on noise, but that's about it.  If they surveyed everyone that has applied and that we have turned down over the last 15 years, they would find that there was a clear reason for each denial, and it was based on our written requirements of Credit Score, Academic Progress, and References.  That's it.  There is no evil, juicy story to report.\n\nAshley applied to rent from Badger in Sept 2014 for a Dec 14 opening..  I admit, I could have done better with the questions or the office lighting(?), but I have made no further attempt to contact her or to be in her life in any way beyond the Application period.  I am not sure why in April of 2016 she has decided to bring these accusations/allegations."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf31c31a91691:0x5164e38502b4d2b0"}

I requested 1 night be reimbursed out of the 7 that we stayed - then after two more emails they never responded.  And apparently this is regarded as a threat by them.\n\nWe arrived and the first thing we noticed is the washer door is open and about 1 foot full of filthy dark brown water. We called and got somebody trying to fix it but was unsuccessful. Repair man was great but stated they have been unable to fix washer over past weeks. I left to go to the beach and let him do his work. After 2 days of not hearing anything back I had to call office and ask about what they were going to do about the water. Somebody came to drain it. After a couple more days of not hearing about repair status I asked and they said it's unfixable.\n\nThe troublesome part about the washer is they knew it was having issues for weeks and never notified us we would be unable to do laundry. A family of 4 on a beach vacation needs this. I would have found another option. The attitude was consistently like we were a burden and it's no big deal to not have a washer. I'm on vacation and last thing I want to do is spend hours at the laundromat - but apparently that's only worth $30 of trouble.\n\nAdditionally there was never anything in the ad about the washer being broken.  Only after my numerous complaints did Gulfsands update their descriptions to say washer did not work.  If you look at other reviews online apparently this has been an issue for months.\n\nAlso we found two huge dead cockroaches each about 2.5 inches long. I guess this was the result of the exterminators that arrived unannounced to apply poison in our condo. Between the washer and the exterminator we had 3 visits from maintenance personnel while we are trying to relax on vacation.\n\nAlso 2 of the 3 TVs were unable to connect to the Wi-Fi. Not a big deal on beach vacation but worth mentioning. Cable doesn't work in 1 bedroom too.\n\nAlso even though Covid restrictions are lifted, Gulfsands is still doing a \"remote\" check in that is cumbersome. It feels like they are using the situation as an excuse to not have to interact with people. The office you pick your keys up at resembles a maximum security prison with all the cameras and just seems over the top.\n\nPositives were tons of hot water, good location across from Waves (groceries, beer, ice, fishing, etc), and normally an OK value if these problems would have been resolved. Condo is certainly dated.\n\nOverall I can't recommend based on my experiences with how the company is managed and the troubles I described with the condo.\n\n*Update*  I think all you need to do is read the response from the owner below to validate they are unreasonable and probably not worth your business :)", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625955081226, "text": "Please disregard this review.  This was a guest who threatened us with reviews if we did not pay them a free night for their washer being out of service.  This is a $30 credit item, which is the highest to any guest, as most were $10.  This is for groups of 6.  The guest told staff to 'keep it', as we learned after departure that they wanted more than $200.  This is called post exit rental extortion and is common in the market, especially this year.  We did confirm with the guest that if we didn't pay that amount, he would go on web sites to write negative reviews?  As you can see, this is the result.  The other issues appeared only after the request for money, which is also how this game works.  We don't play, as most other agents have stopped as well.  BTW, a large bug as described is a palmetto bug, and it is not from the condo, as it simply walked in an open door to escape the heat.  That's where they come from, outside.  We wish the guest the best, and hope they enjoy our beaches another time.  The water in the washer was soapy, and emptied as soon as requested, as we had to purchase a pump.  We also treated unit with bleach so it smelled clean.  Pest control comes once every 90 days, and not to poison their condo, but to treat pests, as with every condo in the city.  The new washer was on order, and was noted as not functioning in the rental ad since March 2021.  A new timer was installed for the prior guest to gain some life from the unit, and the unit was working for them, then failed again, as we waited several weeks for the new washer to arrive, which it since has.  Stack units were in high demand due to damages from Hurricane Sally and new construction, so they were not available from any source.  We had to wait weeks for it, but compensated each guest fairly.  This is a review done to intentionally hurt us for non payment of an amount that was not going to happen."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

Very prompt response and courteous on the phone. The day we arrived we did a walk through and noticed hair on the floor in the bathroom inside the master bedroom, and there was a strong odor of urine. After raising the toilet seat cover we noticed there was urine on the seat, the rim, and the back of the toilet. We went to the store and bought some cleaner to clean up the mess but could not get the urine smell to dissipate so we closed the door and only used the hall bathroom. It seemed the previous renters had left various children's toys and McDonalds cups in the condo as well. While this wasn't really an issue it made for a disorganized appearance. The A/C was cold, the water was hot, and the view was perfect. I believe your cleaning contractor leaves a lot to be desired and could do a much better job. Knowing that you have various people renting, as a condo owner I would suggest purchasing matching dinner and flatware as well as all cookware. While the appliances were all in working order the dishwasher and washer/dryer were very dated and the stove elements were crooked and awkward to cook on. We absolutely loved the leather/vinyl couch and strongly recommend getting away from fabric furniture unless it is professionally cleaned. I understand the costs of owning beachfront property to be quite expensive, but for the price it could use some updating. You could utilize the cleaning company to check inventory of everything on the day of checkout and charge the renter for anything missing or broken items. Also I strongly encourage you to purchase darkout curtains for the master bedroom as the outside lights and early sunrise made it very cumbersome to sleep. The only reason this got 4 stars was due to the nastiness of the room. We would definitely give this company and owner another chance in the future because we love Gulf Shores and it is our favorite vacation destination so we will be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

Upon calling Gulfsands Rental, we were informed that the hot/cold was reversed, meaning H was cold and C was hot. The exact words of the agent were, \"Oh, that is reversed, try keeping the knob on cold.\" There was nothing posted to this affect in the bathroom, even though this as a known issue by the rental company.\n\nIn the master bedroom, the ceiling fan was not working. When calling the rental company they stated it worked only with a remote of which there was not one. A maintenance request was put in. When the guy showed up to look at it he said the motor was blown and he would have to either order a new part or a new fan. It was not fixed during our 5 night stay. We called on day one about the fan.\n\nOther minor issues were the floor was not clean when we arrived, the wifi connection was unreliable and when eating, the only place for multiple people to eat was on the balcony, 3 deep on the soft or perched on the most uncomfortable bar stools ever created.\n\nTo sum up the review, the rental company should have been more forthcoming about known issues prior to booking. We feel we did not get what we paid for.

This unit is not, and has never been noted as penthouse level, this was a guest mistake.  Unit 1202 is one level below the penthouse level and 12th floor is no different otherwise.  Nothing special is available on the penthouse floor.  Bunks are photo'd online and ARE described for children.  Sounds like the stay was very good, but not indicated as such.  The shower is actually correct, but we have found the simplest way to note how it works to the guests that have issues is to say its reversed.  There is an arrow on the rounded side of shower arm pointing to the H and C, but most folks miss it, so they assume the arm is to point to H or C.  We regret the issue, but it's just how it was manufactured.  The stools are brand new and heavy duty.  Don't know what else we can say.  This is a wonderful, updated condo with a great view.  We did report the fan not working to the owner, and he is fedexing his replacement for arrival today, as they are special units.  Light worked, and the AC makes the unit very cold, but one fan did not turn during the stay, and we did everything we could to repair it.  We received a 2 star review.  We view this review as inappropriate, as we have great deals and this is a very nice condo.  We feel reviews like this have no place on the web, but they have become commonplace as people will go out of their way to damage a company's reputation with little issue, but the thousands of happy guest won't take the time to note the great time they had.

We regret that our credit card policy created your review, as we hope your vacation was enjoyable and you felt you got a good deal (we have the best agent pricing in that complex).  Our policy is provided up front in our rental agreement and also on our Policies page on our web site to keep folks informed.  Card policies in the accommodations industry continually change and have become quite strict.  We follow all Visa, MC, AMEX and Discover policies as they protect both you and the condo owner.  We did offer the option of sending checks from multiple parties, since we can only accept CC payment from the person signing the agreement, and you did send checks from 2 different parties for payment.  We hope that helped.  With check in, our policy is the same as a hotel, and only the person on the reservation can check in.  We can add an additional tenant prior to check in, but they need to sign an agreement and also have a card on file.  Please know that our goal is to make your stay enjoyable, but we do note our policies up front and have to abide by them."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

From time to time there are guest who leave trash and do not respect others but as owners we do our best to screen each renter as best possible. Overall this CAN BE a very nice place to stay close to all the happening areas as well as short walk to public beach access. Just make sure to book your condo with a RESPECTABLE owner with positive reviews and good feedback. Try AirBNB look for unit 110 ;) .... check reviews. And most of all ENJOY LAS PALMAS no matter what room you stay in and remember to respect others and the condo rules so we can all have a nice place to enjoy the gulf coast.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b4effa05bf9:0xffc1af7b1ecf545"}

Took almost a year to renovate but everything is beautiful. However, the transition to a new wifi had left me unable to work from home or do schoolwork because of the terrible connectivity. I can barely even watch tv on my Xbox since they switched the network. I have called white sky and nothing helps. They installed the wifi in a terrible place so I can\u2019t even connect a router to extend the signal. White sky person came and recommended that I run a cord from the kitchen to the other side of my apartment. Never had these issues when we had Xfinity and it was much nicer. The apartment is overpriced for students not to even have good wifi and there aren\u2019t any Ethernet ports to hardwire internet. It is not a hardware issue. My TVs and Xbox are brand new and I had NO issues with xfinity for the 2 years we used them. As you can see in my pictures sometimes the connection drops just minutes between.\n\nUPDATE: The owner of my condo is now trying to move us out. The office has sent people up here AGAIN to work on the WiFi and they said the issue was not the WiFi but my usage. However, when I had all devices off as they suggested, other than the one I am using, and I\u2019m still unable to work on school or remotely effectively.

Lots of maintenance problems too: the air filter in the apartment I stayed at probably hadn't been changed since the place was built because it was completely clogged. First floor apartments have bugs too. The kitchen counters are warped and starting to break, the carpets are nasty, and the cracked window in the bedroom still hasn't gotten fixed either.

We waited just to move into a dirty apartment. Nothing was prepared for us. The mailbox key was the wrong key and the mailbox was broken so we couldn\u2019t get our mail, and of course we were waiting on something important to be delivered. We didn\u2019t have a gate opener so we had to use a code that worked half the time. When I finally received a gate opener it didn\u2019t work because they didn\u2019t activate it. The gate is trash and stopped working. Then our laundry room was flooding b\\c of the air conditioning. We had to call them 3 times before they actually fixed it, just for it to happen again months later. We paid rent EVERY month ON TIME but they would put all the rent either on my account or my room mate\u2019s account so we would get eviction notices. This has happened at least 6 out of the 9 months we have lived here. Then they decide they want to take up the carpet and replace it with something else while we\u2019re still living here!! They kept changing the date so the day ends up being on a week where I have worked three 16-hour days plus I have back issues and need an operation so I\u2019m having to try and move all my stuff out of my room and closet so they can do something they could\u2019ve done after we leave this place!! Which just made my pain worst. For a month or two they had no groundskeeper so there was dog feces all over the property!! Everywhere you stepped you were likely to step in it. The tub is made of horrible material and is terribly hard to clean. The faucet in the bathroom has been leaking since I moved in. The walls are thin and you can hear the people upstairs. The dryer is trash and you have to dry your cloths twice just to get them dry. There\u2019s no button for the garbage disposal. This place is trash for the cost!!

My overall experience here was above average and I did enjoy living at Vie at University Downs, but it was a roller coaster. The staff is AWESOME. Nothing else to say there, they are all really good people and willing to help. I moved in fast and it was very easy, especially from a gentleman named Rulondo who helped me numerous times during my residency. Also, I want to emphasize how impressed I was with the security in the complex. There are numerous guards roaming and keeping watch, I felt very safe here.\n\nIn the units, the floor layouts are nice and the rooms are pretty spacious, the living/dining room especially.\n\nI did however, have a few things I\u2019d like to share. The first negative experience I had was after I was all moved in, I realized my apartment\u2019s living room and dining room was unfurnished. I was informed that when the new ownership took over earlier in 2018, they furnished every unit with furniture. The one I lived in however, had a resident who had been in there prior to the change in management and had personal furniture already in his room. They told him that In order to get the living room stuff: couch, chair, television, tv stand, dining room table, chairs (basically everything one would need in a living space), that he must also accept the bedroom furniture. This meant he had to move all of his stuff out of there. Since he already had everything he needed, he declined.\nIronically, the other two bedroom units were furnished but the living room was still left empty. I tried numerous times to get furniture in this apartment but it felt like the staff really didn\u2019t care about doing this and just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I was told numerous times that because we had already \u201copted out\u201d of receiving furniture months ago, there was \u201cnothing they could do.\u201d Also, I know for a fact there was a plethora of extra furniture available. I let it go because I only signed a short term lease but to me this was unacceptable and simply just laziness on the management\u2019s part.\n\nIn October, the whole complex underwent a network change to a company called Single digits. In summation, we were without internet connection for about two weeks and even after everything was \u201cfixed\u201d I still experienced issues. I discussed this with the staff and I can vouch for them that they did everything they could to get it up and running as fast as possible. However, I don\u2019t know if they made the correct decision going with this company.\n\nSomething minor, but I felt necessary to be addressed is there are a lot of bugs. I am aware this was a problem a long time ago and the staff has previously addressed this, but I still had numerous experiences. Ant infestations: One in my bedroom from the trashcan and one in the kitchen pantry. This was fixed easily by a few and traps but still gross and took a while to clean up the dead ants. I am not sure if the property had been treated for bugs but mine definitely wasn\u2019t, not to mention that there were roaches in the kitchen, often.\n\nAfter seeing what other apartment complex\u2019s are like. Yes, I had a few complaints, but I want to make sure the management can see these because feedback is a great way to improve. Vie at University Downs does have a lot to offer and it was a nice place to live. With a few fixes and changes, this place has the potential to be a top notch choice for living in Tuscaloosa, but changes definitely need to be made. They are upgrading the clubhouse and I assume it will be very nice.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583962215841, "text": "Thank you so much for your useful insights.

I moved in late September to a 3 bedroom unit. However my garbage disposal has constantly went out every month, my hot water heater leaks onto the floor in the washing room and the dryer has to be rigged to keep running and this is just the beginning. I was moved into a unit that was already occupied in which it states on our move in lease if you moved in during the month of august you have 72 hours to get the lights in your name. So I think my apartment already has a power account attached to it that I just have to pay on. I gave something one month however in the month of December my power has been turned off due to it not being in someone's name. I was never notified of ANY of this and to make matters worse neither one of the two people I live with will reply to my text messages nor my calls. I'm just ready for my lease end honestly. If you already have roommates maybe it's not that bad but this is a very unacceptable situation. And to make matters worse the best option the leasing office could give me was to pay the start up fees and bill for Alabama power and bring in the bill and they will charge it to my roommates accounts. First off I shouldn't have to handle this myself, second off why would I want to continue staying in a unit where I can't get a answer from either one on A matter as serious as this. I'm the one without power right now while both of them are gone and nobody is helping me fix this", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481646356614, "text": "Hey Tony,\n\nWe are so sorry that you are having problems with your power.

I understand there is a large amount of residents that occupy this complex, but in-turn, office workers and management should be working urgently to process maintenance requests and to solve other issues to keep PAYING CUSTOMERS satisfied with their living space. This has not been our experience while living here. My sister and I have lived with UD for almost 6 months and requests we put in those 6 months ago have still not been taken care of. Don\u2019t bother calling the office because they probably won\u2019t answer. And they have neglected returning promised phone calls on multiple occasions. Office is known to close earlier than the hours listed on their door/website which is inconvenient for those of us who work, or interested people traveling from out of town. It is very unfortunate because we love the property, but until management changes I believe these issues will remain the same.

I went on about thirty different tours of different complexes in Tuscaloosa to view one bedroom apartments as this was my only option due to the issues I had leading me to needing a place. To say the least a majority of the apartment options in this town are sketch especially when its last minute last chance in May. However when I came to the downs, Bronson took me and my mom and sister on a tour and it was a great experience. I wanted to see the type of unit I would actually be living in as opposed to just a model unit and they understood my concerns so they made it happen. One of the other employees, Jade, let me go into her apartment and see what it was like since that would be the layout I would ultimately end up with, without hesitation or second thought. I ended up signing for this current year and have been here since August. I have nothing but great things to say about the office staff especially Andrew who truly makes anyone's day each time you see him. Being so far away from family no matter what year you are in is always hard but the staff always is so welcoming and caring. When you read other reviews they talk about disasters of maintenance and such where their needs aren't attended to but I have not seen where that's an issue. Like normal there are always going to be household things that need fixing no matter where you live, its just a part of life and being a tenant. I have had my fair share of unwanted critters (yikes its ok I am alive still) or leaks/minor breaks but no matter what the office always responded fast and urgent for me. People fail to forget that its usually just one person, Ryan, doing all the repairs so they need to cut him some slack and be understanding that the issue will be addressed quickly but maybe not immediately. As far as safety goes, I feel secure at the apartment and the one incident where I was nervous about someone near my apartment I called the office and legitimately a golf cart, and I am talking like one of those extended ones, full of staff came zooming in and investigated and checked in on me to make sure I was okay, including Taylor Duncan the leasing manager too. I find that the staff really makes the living experience worth while at apartment complexes which is why I gave 5 stars overall. I had a few hiccups here and there with maintenance or billing like I mentioned but those issues were resolved to a level of satisfaction which is the part that matters most. Now that this novel of a review is over have a great day and if you are in a predicament where you need not just a house but a home stop on over here at UD!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1518124468038, "text": "Thank you Tiffani Greene for sharing your fantastic experience with us.

When I first began paperwork with them they were undergoing renovations, which at the time was exciting to see. When I came in a couple weeks later to finish my paperwork they had lost it! Papers that had my entire identity plastered all over them as well as my co-signers (parents) info! This happened TWO more times. When everything was finally taken care of I had signed during an incentive to get a $600 dollar gift card or use it as credit towards my first months rent, so being the poor college student that I am I put it towards my rent, well when it came time to pay first months rent they told me I couldn't use that incentive because I was in a privately owned unit. Why would you assign a resident who signed during an incentive special, a condo that's privately owned therefore cancelling out that incentive?\n\nIt's just one inconvenience after another with these guys. Probably because they can't get a property management company to stick around long enough for things to flow smoothly. University Downs has gone through three ownerships since I've been involved with them. The staff is almost entirely undertrained or under-qualified to be handling the responsibilities they're supposed to take care of with ease. Nearly every question is answered with \"I'll have to check with my manger when they get back\". Which then leads to nothing because the manager is never around.\n\nAlso if you're planning to live on the condo side rather than the apartment side then please know that all those inclusions they promise like wifi/cable or Google Chromecast are NOT included. They didn't share that until after we had signed or lease.\n\nTruly an awful experience. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for housing. Aside from the awful management the condos are higher quality builds than most of the newer places, however be prepared to do all of the move-in cleaning yourself, I've never seen such a gross move-in room.

However, my experience with University Downs in Tuscaloosa has been an absolute nightmare. The experience has been so negative that it warrants more than just a bad review, but also legal action.\nAfter the new management company (Asset Campus Housing) bought the complex from Ellis-Trick, all of the services went downhill. From trash pickup to rent payment every facet of life at UD changed for the worse. Most importantly, the management staff (not necessarily the office staff) has been unhelpful, incompetent, and downright rude.\nFirst, even though my name was on the lease (I am looking at a copy right now), my name was NEVER put into their system, so every time I called they couldn\u2019t speak with me (or pull up my lease apparently). Furthermore, they never put any of the emails on my lease into their system. When my roommate wrote a check for $785 instead of $795 on accident, we were never notified of the \u201clate payment\u201d either by phone or email \u2013 even though they had both. So they after a few months that $10 charge grew into hundreds. They then had the audacity to place an eviction notice on my door. So they can walk to my apartment to threaten eviction but they can\u2019t notify me of a $10 dollar payment??? Needless to say I paid the $10 dollars I owed them, but not a penny more! And I wished it ended there\u2026\nWhen I moved to a different city over the summer (and paid two rents because I didn\u2019t want to sublease!) they actually moved another person into my apartment!!!! I found out about this when I went back to my apartment on checkout day (to turn in my key) and there was someone else living in there with all their stuff! I have had two UD employees acknowledge this, but they don\u2019t see a problem with it at all \u2013 even though I was still paying rent!\nFinally, after months of phone calls, emails, and weeks on end of no response, I still have not received my security deposit back. They have acknowledge \u2013 finally \u2013 that they owe me the security deposit, but now they said they \u201cmailed the check.\u201d That was over three weeks ago. This is on the point of ridiculous. The managers at the office do not care. They are rude and completely unprofessional. I have friends who have been through similar experiences at UD! And you should understand. I took pride in my apartment. It was always clean inside and out, and well taken care of.\nI could go on for another page or two\u2026\nI am going back to Tuscaloosa in a few years, and they could not PAY ME to live there.\nFinally, apparently the complex is being purchased by a new company in 2016. Don\u2019t live there!!! They are keeping the same rude and unprofessional managers \u2013 so nothing will change. In fact, it will probably get worse.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a82f5f021da3:0x9a4a2ef42a843052"}

The appliances all do not work correctly. Staff/maintenance comes in whenever (literally they will knock and, from the back bedroom, not give us enough time to put pants on and go open the door before they are already letting themselves in) to fix or change things without even telling residents. They have just come in our place numerous times this year with numerous excuses. They tell you they would give residents a heads up if they have to come in, but that is not true. One day while we had multiple friends over, they came in and said they had to paint all our walls. Needless to say, that was the final straw and we told them they could not paint that day randomly without telling us, while we had people over. We live on the second story and one morning we were woken up at 8 am bc some workers had climbed up the back balconies and were on our back porch working, of course without telling us. I have never lived somewhere where maintenance just comes in without warning so many times in a year. Our friends have a joke going on about hanging at our apartment because maintenance will probably be joining us. Also, one day when they randomly came, we had an empty cat litter box. No cat, not cat toys/food, not even cat litter, just the empty box, and then they tried to charge us $500 by saying we had a pet and kept coming by randomly to catch a nonexistent cat in our place. Even then, $500 seemed like much for a cat. Another thing, along with not telling any residents about maintenance coming to do anything in residents places, they have also decided to change the internet connection and password without telling residents. We went almost a week, a school week without internet is very difficult, thinking the internet had gone out without being fixed. We finally called and they told us it had been changed. We told them we were not happy they would do that without telling us, therefore making us go without. The next day, after we had gone the week without internet and then resolved the issue, they came by and put a paper in our door telling us they changed the internet, so at least our complaining did something, even if it was a week too late.\nOverall, you will not have the privacy you want in your apartment and do not count on the staff/maintenance to do great jobs. If you can get pass that, the pools and community itself is not bad, just needs better people running it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a82f5f021da3:0x9a4a2ef42a843052"}

The apartment itself was nice, despite the large bloodstain upon the guest bedroom duvet cover upon arrival, which the owner later accused us of causing. . The residents of the complex did not hold back in unleashing their full \"Karen\", and we were falsely accused numerous times by residents of the complex for \"infractions\", such as not cleaning up after our dogs- which was false and not supported by any evidence (we are very conscious of the need to pick up after our pets!!) This, along with a slew of other false accusations, resulted in nightly visits from security coming to our apartment to scold my parents (who are in their mid-60s) and I as if we were school children, putting a major damper on our evenings.  Whereas the security guards themselves were generally friendly, we felt as if we were unwelcome and being \u201cwatched\u201d. We were also accused of not having \u201cregistered\u201d one of the dogs, again untrue as they eventually admitted.\n\nLastly, and this may not be as important for some people, but the Wi-Fi network that is offered to guests is not secured. For people who work remotely with sensitive data, this did not provide an accommodating environment. Hours after we left the Phoenix, I realized that my Amazon account had been hacked- I am inclined to believe that this was a result of being forced to access an unsecured network.\n\nAfter our departure the owner contacted us to complain about the apartment. Her claim was that our dirty sheets were not clean enough. Yes, you read that correctly. She also complained about other minor matters that were well within the bounds of normal everyday use. Next time we will make sure to take photos on departure.\n\nAs a residence that claims to be \"dog friendly\" it certainly is not in our opinion a welcoming place for larger dogs (over 40 pounds). We were constantly harassed and accused of things which we could prove we were not responsible for. Thankfully we were able to get away to the beach for a couple of days and enjoy the beautiful Orange Beach scenery and weather. If you are looking for a fun, relaxing and dog-friendly environment, this is not the place for you!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a079383d8dafb:0x2b9750baf75e249e"}

We rarely could get the remote to work. I had to call maintenance and they came several hours later saying it was fixed. I still had trouble with it.

The second instance a family near us was scolded for playing audible music around the pool and for having snacks by their pool chairs. Third we had a family member have their bracelet break overnight and the front desk security guard jokingly wanted 80 dollars and bargained with me for 50 bucks before realizing it wasn't funny and offering a new one for 5 dollars. Final straw was when our family staying at the next door phoenix property were told to buy a wrist band or leave when visiting our property's pool. We verified this was ok ahead of booking, but we're lied to. Apparently there's a lawsuit between the two phoenix properties and guests of the two are the ones left to suffer.\n\nThis is the first and last time we stay here.

The pool itself does not open until 9:00, but we were in NO way using the pool. Just simply wanting to sit by the fountain and read. The homeowners association lady, Pam, made sure to let me know that the general manager, Michael, reported to her so it didn't matter that I had called him. She then gave me a line about the chemicals that they were putting in the pool didn't need to have anyone around them....please. So on vacation, I was run out of a chair which was not hurting myself or disturbing anyone else.\n\nAs our day went on, we were completely appalled by the behavior that is allowed at the Phoenix on the Bay 2. Adults were throwing empty beer cans from the lazy river into the kiddie pool area and slinging beer everywhere, cussing, flipping off the security guard, Quinton, who was doing his best, blocking the lazy river, and handing out shots in the lazy river. Tons of children and families were there, but no respect was given to their needs at all. My child felt very uncomfortable in the environment and hated having to go to the part of the lazy river where the \"drunk adults\" we're congregated.\n\nAt no time did the pool cleaning lady or the homeowners association lady come to stop any of that. Other moms were having to take their children to the small indoor pool to get away from the \"GD\" word. We will NEVER vacation here again. If you are looking to book here because of the slide and lazy river which children should be able to use, go somewhere else. This is NOT an appropriate environment for children or relaxation. We felt like we were in the middle of Mardi Gras weekend swimming in a lazy river of urine because these adults just pull their coolers up to the side and stand in it drinking all day.\n\nWe were made to move from a chair at 8:00am where we had coffee and a book and were not disturbing anyone with loud music or language or obstructing anyone's way...but endured terrible and obscene behavior the rest of our time. Never staying here again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a079383d8dafb:0x2b9750baf75e249e"}

Bring your own plates, cups, utensils, laundry soap, dishwasher soap, paper towels, cleaning products- including toilet paper.\nThere should be an outside shower somewhere,  but there is not.  There is an outside spigot for you to wash your feet.  There needs to be some outside hooks for hanging towels, etc.\nLet's talk about location.  The cottages are all in a row from the main street.  If you book, ask exactly how far the cottage is from the main road.  You have to walk across a very busy road to get to the beach.  The walk is fairly short, but would be a challenge for little ones.  Not sure where the pic of the road in the ad came from, but it is misleading.\nDon't bring a toddler here.

If ever an issue, we can usually pick up from one next door or straight across.  I doubled checked our email system report status of each emails sent out to see if reported sent/viewed. All were sent out but not viewed,  so that may be to why you didn't see the information provided about the internet issue.  Also, we keep a FAQ sheet in our homes with contact number for internet on the weekends for after hour issues.  Both Ally and I were at the cottages several times over the weekend, either of us would have been more than happy to bring ice for you or ran to grab some, had we known it was an issue when dropping off other items requested. The after hour number is the best source to text or call, which is our main number. The number is also provided via emails, website, or in house information sheets for any emergency issues such as water leaks, a/c issues, electrical, or plumbing.  We will be sure to have our maintenance take a look since we are now aware its not working properly. We send out check-in instructions with list of all items to expect upon arrival, which is one set up of household items. This list can also be viewed in the rental agreement, FAQ sheet and terms and conditions as well. I will look into other ways to push the information out in the future to help clarify.  We appreciate the suggestions for the outdoor items and will relay to the owners as possible items to add over the next year.\nLastly, we have several photos, videos, and detailed descriptions of our properties in order to ensure every guest is aware of locations and layout of the cottages. Our photos show different angles from different homes interior and exterior.  Video wise we have several tours of the homes and walks to the beach. The walk from the back entrance less than 2 minutes and from the front entrance 1 minute and 30 seconds. Upon arrival at the red light to cross over, the city installed a cross walk, revamped the side walk area which is over 6ft wide, and dropped the speed limit to 25 mph to ensure safety for all crossing to beach areas. Again we do our best to portray our properties as is and to provide more than adequate information readily available on several platforms for viewing.  We are always happy to answer any questions if any still are left unanswered."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04b7589069fd:0x8a3995f761fb26c2"}

They just kept messing up our reservations then turned into a screaming match and told we were lying and that we are all fine and should just enjoy the beach even the patio doors to the balcony locked us out. I understand the property has wonderful views. However, this is not how you treat the guests. Even if the property owner was at fault, you decided to manage the property, you are responsible for taking care of the guests. Due to the horrible experience we left and stayed somewhere else the second night. Even a simple apology and explanation would\u2019ve helped. Instead we just get called liars and to get deal with it. Should I also mention that there are 3 small kids here and the fridge was full of beer when we arrived? And the balcony door automatically locked if you went outside? How is this a way to manage?? All I wanted was help and what I received, was exactly the opposite.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f3041e5555:0x51bac315ff78141a"}
