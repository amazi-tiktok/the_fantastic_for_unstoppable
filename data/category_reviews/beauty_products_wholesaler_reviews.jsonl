I was sold immediately on their product! I\u2019ve since ordered from them several times. I buy their whipped shea butter mostly - it\u2019s creamy without being greasy and a little goes a long way! I\u2019ve also purchased their products for gifts - needless to say, my mom and grandmother are now hooked! While this review/comment is based on my experiences with this company on a whole, my most recent experience, specifically, is what encouraged me to form a review for the public. I recently placed an order for two of their gift boxes and a couple of single items. The order contained Mother\u2019s Day gifts for my mom and grandmother. The order was received, processed and delivered PROMPTLY - like within two business days (I didn\u2019t pay extra for expedited shipping). I received a text alert when the product was delivered - around noon, yday. It was quite warm outside and I still had hours before I\u2019d get home from work. I was a bit worried about the product sitting in the heat/sun. As soon as I got home, I unpacked the box. The way it was packed so carefully and with consideration was a plus, BUT I also noticed that there was a Koolit refrigerant pack placed in the bottom of my carefully packed order...packed in anticipation of a warm day and no one being home to receive the package once it arrived. This may seem like a small thing. This may seem like \u201ccommon\u201d sense and good business practices, but as someone who does a LOT of online shopping, I can assure you that many businesses don\u2019t put even a fraction of thought and consideration into packing their product for delivery. 1818 Farms has a lifetime customer!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88627d3f82d38f73:0x9815b0297e8927dc"}
