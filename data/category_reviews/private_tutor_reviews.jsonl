He has been progressing very fast. Mr. Brown built him a strong foundation of learning the rhythm and beats in the music first. From there he introduced playing the melodies and chords. Mr. Brown teaches theories and techniques along with musical creativity in a balanced way. He encouraged my boy to compose a 8 measure of song in the very beginning of his lessons. Now, my son can play a children song with both hands playing chords and melodies. He comes to the piano -voluntarily-playing all the major scales, 2 octaves going up and down by himself! Mr. Brown uses many unconventional methods to teach music to his students. But they works! I have seen it from my son. Mr. Brown is also good at communication. He listens to parents' concerns and ideas to make the lessons more suitable to the child. I am pleased about my son's progress and music experience with Madison Music Academy.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597859047058, "text": "Thank you so much for your kind words.

First of all, thank you for sharing your lovely children with us for after-school Robotics.  We had so much fun with that bright group of little learners!\nCoding is very heavily involved in Robotics.  It is important to introduce new skills and concepts in a way that is best for the students to understand and grow their basic working knowledge.  At times, it is necessary to use unplugged activities to set each student up for success in these new coding concepts, especially in such a young group of engineers.\nAs for the subscription / final session:  We have been conducting after-school programs since the beginning of the school year for this particular school.  We charge a flat subscription fee no matter the number of weeks included in the month.  Some months had 5 sessions and some had 4 making it even out in the end.  Canceling the last session in the month was a worst case scenario for us.  We regret it was unavoidable due to mass sickness, leaving us with no teaching options.\nI believe in what we do and I'm so proud of how we do it!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888e81c389684d93:0x98e1599fff497dfc"}
