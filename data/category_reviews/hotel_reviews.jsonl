Cracker Barrel. With that said, there's nothing else good to say about this horrible hotel  First of all, Drug Addicts beg and walk all night. I began to have a rash after staying there. Turns out that finally after leaving some papers on my bed one night, I was disgusted to see... BEDBUGS.  I notified the Manager, and he showed 0 - Little remorse. He did nothing to accomodate me. All he did was spray some Awesome on the bed and changed the sheets. Needless to say, I was already packed and ready to go. I Heard other guest complaints of general filth. Bottom line, If you are looking for a room to get high and pass out and let bedbugs crawl all over you while the dealers and addicts steal your stuff, Just go see the manager. The crackheads have analysed these facilities, and given it a 5 Crackpipe rating. It's all that a crackhead could ever want. For anyone else, it is not anything that a decent individual would wish to inhabit AT ALL... The worst part it I am a single man, and not even picky, However, I am sanitary. So if you are indeed considering this hotel, that smelled like a Hoe's Tail, and has all of my belongings smelling like it, you would be better off randomly pulling over to the side of the road and sleeping in you car. You would come out better. I have video, pictures, the bedbugs itself, blood on my paper after I killed the bug.  Once I found the first one, I found many more, all at different life cycles, which indicated a bedbug infestation to me. Needless to say, They will be hearing from my attorney soon.

She wanted to wait on the other patron first, COMPLETELY ignoring me and my 6 month old in my arms. He told her to get me before him.\n\nWe started going through the normal motions of checking in when I asked if the hotel were pet friendly. She NASTILY replied they weren't. ( Take in to account I've been on the road since 7 am and my mind wasn't working anymore with the cacophony in my vehicle ). So I asked if she had any idea who did. Again a nasty reply: 'You can try the MICROtel.'\n\nSeriously? Ya know, I wouldn't have minded being told they weren't pet friendly. It was her BAD ATTITUDE that set me off. I was IN TEARS pulling out of there. And yes, as soon as I put my 6 month old back in the car seat, he started screaming again. I'll think twice about staying at a Best Western after this experience. You'll get No compassion at all from them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a5410674a2abd:0x85c912db01ceea41"}

My husband took our daughter downstairs on his shoulders to see the pool, a few minutes after they left Ruby at the front desk called my room and told me that guest were complaing and to please tell my child to stop running. She wasn't even in the room. So when I went down stairs to ask her what the deal was she told me that she had just seen my husband and daughter. No apology for the false accusations. That night we were in the room and the kids above us were running and making so much noise I couldn't hear the TV. I called the front desk 3 times and nothing was done.  A few days later I talked to the \"manager\" I don't think she had a clue what she was doing. There was no apology from anyone except one girl that I talked to at the front desk. She is the only one that seemed to care about the crap we had to put up with that night. There were people on the top floor partying all night. It was very noisy.

They would get mad at the girl at the front desk and take it out on me telling me to leave the property or get put in jail. Well then they calm down and want me to stay but they treated me very badly. Jay and Mona the owners at one point had 10 flooded rooms down stairs and they were full of mold and had no carpet in them but still said I had to pay 65 a day or work for just the room up at all hours of the night. Marvin the guy up there at this present time came to me the last time I stopped to see my wife because I had been for a couple of days to see my kids because my kids weren't allowed to visit with me there and Marvin told me to get off the property or I would be arrested. My mother came by at one point with my children to bring me some groceries and Mona got mad and said I had to many people in the room. They were just dropping off groceries. I was accused of stealing from them and when they found the tools they accused me of stealing in the owner Jay's van never once did I get an apology and in the end they ended up ruining the relationship between me and my wife and I've lost her due to everything that took place because of them. Marvin is very racist because I was talking to some black rappers that were passing through town and got a room and while I was talking to them Marvin comes out assuming it's a drug deal.

There was also a strange odor. We stayed because it was cheap and they had already charged my card for 2 nights. The ice machine was broke and look like something out of a horror film. We stayed 2 days without the room being cleaned or any garbage bags or tissue so we bought our own. I called the front desk to get a noon check out and was rudely told NO by a white guy posing as the manager. So we left at 11 and by 1:00 my card was charged an additional $50 for a cleaning fee. First of all when do hotels start charging for a free service. The room was already a smoking room so there is no charge for that. We stayed 2 days and did not have the thrash changed or given any bags for thrash. I threw all of my garbage in the thrash can and tried to straighten the room up as best as I could but after Mr Manager rudely told me to get out I did not clean the room since you have a housekeeping department for that.

( She was there helping her mother after her mother had heart surgery 2 weeks ago.)\nSo by the time we traveled as we did and spent all of the time at the hospital with my mother we wanted to sleep.\nWe arrived at your location checked in and went to the room. When I first walked in I notice that the ashtray was filled with cigarette butts, walked to the bathroom and seen that there was urine on the floor by the commode, then I got to looking and notice that the shower was very nasty the ceiling looked as it was fixing to fall, the shower rod was barley hanging on, and a piece of duct tape just stuck to the wall. Also notice that there was hair on the towel. Very unhappy at this point I thought let me look at the bed, the first bed was dirty, it had hair and spots all over the sheets the 2nd bed it had food on the sheets and brown spots.\nAt this point I had enough was so upset. I had dropped my keys behind the chest and had to move it and surprise again a powder substance with a straw.\nI am NO longer upset I am MAD.\nI went down to the lobby and told the desk clerk what I was dealing with. She let me know she did not have any more rooms I ask for more sheets and towels, just so that I could lay down for a few hours to be back at hospital with my mom. She said hold on walked around the corner and walked back said she did not have any and there was \"NOTHING SHE COULD DO FOR ME\". Really!!!!!!!\nSo because we had all of our items unpacked already I decided that I would just run to the nearest Walmart purchase sheets and blankets. Just so that we can get some sleep.\nWe did not even take showers due to not having clean towels.\nSo I was putting the sheets and things on the bed and SURPRISE AGAIN the matters had a very big whole in it and then I was beside my self.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a54106e190e0b:0x152474591dc23d97"}

The only things that I\u2019d say wasn\u2019t great would be the shower, and the lack of kitchen supplies they provide. The shower is pretty narrow so it can difficult to shower. The kitchen only has the bare necessities, and nothing more lol. If you have family near by make sure to ask them for a blender, extra cooking spoons, pizza pan, extra pots and pans, larger knifes, food storage container, and mixing bowls, measuring spoons and cups. They also only provide two Keurig coffee containers then charge if you want more, so make sure to buy some at the store to get more for your buck.
