My boyfriend and I went into the store around 8:00pm on a Thursday. There were no other customers in the store, and there were two women working. The two workers were mainly interested in talking to each other through the door between the service bar and the kitchen. We were trying to decide what to order, and I asked the staff member named Katherine if she could tell us how about the Acai frozen yogurt. At first Katherine just stared at me, and then she said in a disrespectful tone of voice that was honestly identical to how children and pre-teens make fun of their peers \u201cHA HA Excuse me! What did you just say?\u201d I repeated my question of asking for additional information about the Acai frozen yogurt. To which she responded in the same disrespectful tone \u201cIt is pronounced Acai! Oh my gosh!\u201d She then just stood there giggling to herself and still did not provide any information about the Acai frozen yogurt as we requested. This was not a funny situation; it was flat out insulting. I was stunned. We left, of course, and did not buy any products from Freeze Yogurt Bar.\n\nWe promptly went across the street to Steel City Pops \u2013 where there was a line \u2013 and a staff member with outstanding customer service (his name is Jacob - just to give credit where credit is due). Jacob was patient, informative, answered questions, and provided samples. We ended up purchasing double the amount of pops that we planned on because the experience was so outstanding.\n\nAfter I had calmed down and gathered my thoughts, I went back to Freeze Yogurt Bar to try to explain to the staff member what happened and why it upset me. I knew rationally that I couldn\u2019t expect change \u2013 or even awareness \u2013 without expressing that information. The other staff member (name unknown) is who talked to me and just kept saying in a disingenuous voice \u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d Katherine was also behind the counter, but she avoided eye contact with me and did not offer any sort of apology.\n\nThe main take away that I would like the Freeze Yogurt Bar staff to take from this incident is that disabilities are not always physical and cannot always be seen on the outside. You have no idea when one of your customers has a reading disability (or any other kind of disability) and you are behaving incredibly disrespectfully. The damage was done. All that was left was to correct the mistake and apologize, and Katherine (as a representative of the entire business) couldn\u2019t even get it right to own up to what happened and apologize.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1560560163193, "text": "We\u2019re sorry to hear of your unsatisfactory experience with Freeze and we offer our sincerest apologies.\n\nWith a focus on customer experience, we were surprised by your comments.\n\nIf you would like to discuss further, please contact us at guestservices@freezeyogurtbar.com\nWe would like an opportunity to work towards earning back your business.\n\nFreeze Yogurt Bar"}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf382c216628d:0x7d863f4887e736c9"}

I asked a few more questions but I could tell she was annoyed by my questions, so I picked a flavor quickly to just be done.\nWhen she handed me the cup the custard was already melting over the sides- while I appreciated the generous helping, she stood and watched me as I cleaned up the mess she gave me along with what fell on the counter. No help or offer to help- just watching me struggle.\nAs a paying customer, I do expect to have some sort of kindness and helpfulness when I am giving you my business. I understand that it is \u201conly $5 worth of custard\u201d but some level of customer service instead of treating someone as an burden will get you a long way.
