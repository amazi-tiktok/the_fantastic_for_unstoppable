After talking with Ben, the manager, I was pretty impressed with the business and the level of knowledge and technical skills the staff demonstrated.  I was impressed enough that I returned last week with my Canyon for a much needed tune up and preventative maintenance.  JT and James took a lot of time with me to ensure that they fully understood what I wanted while simultaneously inputting their maintenance advice to absolutely ensure that my servicing plan was exactly what I needed.  I valued their advice because as part of my service I wanted new cables, chain, front disk brake (slight warp), and new wheel bearings.  They agreed with the cables and chain but went out of their way to straighten the disk brake and clean, inspect, and re-grease the bearings, which of course wound up being a much greater value for the money, at least on my side of the deal.  I have around 100 miles on the service and the replacement parts and the service adjustments and tuning are perfect. These small things combined with the quality of the final product earn Trek Bicycles of Auburn a great deal of trust from me, which in turn ensures that I will make that tedious drive every time I need service for my bike.  Additionally, for new bike purchases and bike accessory needs the store has many bikes on hand and nearly every accessory that one should want or need.

Ordered shifter never called me to let me know. Installed shifter, never called me to let me know it was done. When I picked the bike up the rear tire was missing entire sections of tread and both tires have red mud on them even though my son only rode in the grass. Again, tech refuses to take ownership of the problem and points to me. Taken my bike there twice for repairs/adjustments but nothing is ever fixed. They also take over a week to receive brake pads for bikes they stock. Why on earth do you not stock such a common part? Service guys cannot handle a task as simple as documenting my phone number.

On a five point scale, you all earn a six.\n\nAfter all these years, I thought it important to write down how wonderful these folks are and what an awesome bike shop they have.  The Auburn area is most fortunate to have this asset in our community.\n\nI purchased my first mountain bike 5 years ago from James Bros when they were still located in the bank building.  Although a novice at the beginning, I was helped to find a bike that would meet my needs.  I was not oversold.  I was fitted both in terms of how I would ride, my budget and my overall enjoyment with the sport of trail / mountain biking.\n\nWell three bikes later, two for my daughter and one more for me, and I am still extremely satisfied with everything the team does for me and my daughter.  I have upgraded to soft tails and happy I have done so.  James Bros does an excellent job of keeping my bike(s) operating safely.  I cannot stress the term \"safely\" enough.  If you have loose or worn out parts, you are putting your life in jeopardy on the trials in the area.  The staff at James Bros makes sure everything that goes out the door is ready to ride - safely.\n\nEddie and Raleigh offer sound, professional advice.  They do NOT try to sell you something you do not need.  They DO make sure what you ride is safe and enjoyable.  They listen to you.  Really listen.  They find price points and products to fit your needs.  James Bros does not sell \"cheap\" products.  They offer solid value for the money for quality bikes and service.  If you need something they do not have in stock, they will find it.  They will service it.  They will back it up every time.\n\nOne example of how they help.   I needed a locking device for my new soft tail.  Eddie could have easily sold me what was in stock or even ordered a cable set.  However, that is not really what I needed.  So, he  suggested going a big box building store - Lowes - get a long length of plastic coated cable, a good lock and make the custom cable I needed for transporting and storing the bike in my truck.  Problem solved.  And he did it knowing he could have sold me a short cable set that would NOT have met my needs.\n\nEach time I stop by, I am greeted as if I were an old friend.  That is how they treat everyone.  I would like to think I am special.  Perhaps.  But they treat everyone as an old special friend.   There has been more than one time when I have arrived near closing time when the team went ahead, took the bike in, and had it serviced before the end of the next day.  Eddie even came in when the shop was technically closed to help me with a part that was misbehaving.\n\nOverall, I want to make sure folks know James Bros is a well respected bike shop.  If you need something, they will find it and help you with it.  Regardless of your skill or budget, James Bros will work with and for you.\nThank you for many years of a happy biking.\n\nSincerely,\nDanny Butler", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3957860c0f1:0x11d9dc83b7f994c3"}

I was in Auburn for a bike race and needed a quick repair to keep my bike going through the weekend. I arrived at the shop about 30 minutes before they closed to get it fixed and the entire staff was open and willing to help me out. They made sure my bike was taken care of and fixed properly. A big shout out to Raleigh, one of the members on staff, for being extra helpful and making sure everything was taken care of. I highly recommend this bike shop!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3957860c0f1:0x11d9dc83b7f994c3"}

I was looking for a great relationship out of a bike shop and, I finally found one!  It's hard to find that 'feel' that your business is appreciated. We're new to cycling and, it's a perfect way to exercise as I recover through paralysis and such. We live in Florida, but as Auburn grads, my wife and myself spend a lot of time in Auburn visiting my mother.  We decided to check it out and, we're very glad that we did! You won't be disappointed!\n\nThese guys HAVE to be commended on the personal service helping a handicapped man and his family. For instance, as I already mentioned being cycling newbies, we needed to find a car carrying method easy for us with my limitations and, find a specific trailer hitch/bike carrier that my wife can easily use without help.  A couple of phone calls later... the 'Hollywood Sport Rider' fit our needs perfectly and, showed up in two days! When we came-in to pick it up, they had ALREADY ASSEMBLED it for us!!  The thing is like a jigsaw puzzle! They didn't charge us to assemble it AND, the company is big on giving to the Active Duty a Military discount... I wish more American shops/stores/services etc., embrace the James Bros Bikes business model.  Thank you so much guys!  Can't wait until the next time!

We were mountain biking in Chewacla Park for Memorial weekend.  We dealt with Danny James and the service and attention to detail was awesome.  We had a beginner without a bike with us and had to rent one,  normally the rentals would be for 24 hours but since they wouldn't be open the following day we would have needed to get the bike back to the shop before closing (4pm) Danny went out of his way to get our contact information and personally pick up the bike from us the following day so that our beginner could really get a good chance to enjoy the trails.  He also took the time to point out great trails and sites we should see before we depart.  When we got the bike he took the extra time to fit the bike to our rider and make sure the shocks and tires all had the correct pressures.  I've rented bikes from other shops and have yet seen anyone else take this extra time and effort.
