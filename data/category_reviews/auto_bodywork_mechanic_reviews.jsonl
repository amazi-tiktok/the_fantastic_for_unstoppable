I should have followed my first mind to not let my truck be taken there. Thinking that since they do work for Geico that they would be fair. The adjuster JY was unprofessional and is in the wrong business dealing with all types of ppl. Two supervisor called me to talk with me and was all nice but wanted me to give them a call and when something did come up no answer . They raised the price up and was about to put savage parts on from junk yards!!! Then broke my truck down of unnecessary parts , sent me 3 pic of my truck where the damage was and made a mistake and included pic of a Durango include with mine in the estimated online where they dropped the ball at so they could total my truck out. $7,500 their price after I was haggled on what should be fixed or not. The under part that I was told would be looked at by Geico in Macon under and told me that everything would be fixed and even sent a wrecker for it. When I saw this scam I sent for my truck to be taken to another shop of my choice in Trussville where I live at and the price dropped to $2500 . What\u2019s the use of having insurance for 8yrs without any incidents and was deem not my fought and still getting the run around but I guess it\u2019s just a moody thing then , I have a 1,500 rental car limit that I pay for in my and JY told me that it had to be back today mon 2-26-18 or they wasn\u2019t going to extended it til the next day when my truck will be ready I\u2019m the am, how about I called jay (sup) while I was at the shop because they needed to ask him something and he told me he was going to call them and did. They just threw my parts in the back of the bed and shipped with all the unecesary parts too! New parts hand to be shipped in . This is just a scam place too much unprofessionalism going on after JY started talking to nice nasty and rushing me off the phone like I was Bothering her! So after I go meet with the ppl in Macon and send all the paper work and the pictures that I have with m parts and the Durango and explain that I had to miss work tonight because of the treat that JY told me .Also the shop ppl a security system that pick up everything that she said to them about me and my truck which is very unrespectful because they played it back so I could hear her and what she said !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889737b9ba9a8db:0x558163db9059166f"}

I scheduled a service appt online for my Stelvio. I also checked the box for a loaner vehicle. I was scheduled for 4/27/21 for an oil change. Once I checked in I was told by Tom Williams, Manager, that I was not required to have any major services done on this visit but maybe the next time I would need to have my brake fluid flushed. I let him know that I would need a loaner vehicle. His response was, We don\u2019t have any so Johnathan will take you to work. Once I picked up my truck and I was driving off I immediately noticed a different feel to my truck. I just thought it was different because they had done a tire rotation. A few days later I noticed a noise when I braked. It gradually got worse and louder. I called and spoke with Jonathan. I told him about my concerns. He told me it was probably a rock stuck between my rotors and that if it was the brakes my sensors would have let me know it and its probably just a rock but if I brought my truck first thing in the morning it would be a quick and easy fix. He told me they didn\u2019t have any appts available and that they didn\u2019t have any loaner cars for me to drive while they inspected my truck. When I arrived on 5/7 Jonathan stated you are gonna have to leave the truck with us you need new brakes and rotors. I asked why and he said you are metal to metal. So that\u2019s when I immediately started asking what happened when I brought my truck last week, he apologized said the tech just didn\u2019t catch it. I asked what about my sensors, why didn\u2019t they go off, he stated the sensors are on the inside and this was on the outside pad. None, of this was making sense to me. I asked him for a quote for the service to be completed and of course it was approx $700 with a 10% discount. I\u2019m fuming inside by this time bc not only have you all inconvenienced me when I could have had this service done last week, but I was in danger and you lied on my vehicle\u2019s multi point inspection, or maybe you didn\u2019t even do an inspection at all, but now you\u2019re gonna double charge me for labor. I asked him who is the service manager and he stated Tom was. I explained that every time I have come here you all have told me that you do not have loaner vehicles but the last time I was there(for my oil change) he told a customer on the phone \u201coh no worries we\u2019ll put you in something when you get here and you\u2019ll be on your way\u201d. Johnathan replied, \u201cOh that was probably a Maserati owner and he\u2019s gonna put them in a loaner Maserati\u201d. I stated, \u201cso you are telling me that you all hold certain customers to a higher standard because of the type of car they drive\u201d. He stated they don\u2019t have any loaners, and someone could drive me to work. I literally paced the parking lot in disbelief bc of the lower standard of service based on the brand name of the car I drove, the oversight of my right rear brake being completely gone and scrubbing metal to metal, and the fact that over half of the cost for me to have the service done was a charge for labor for some techs that clearly half do their job. People think that it\u2019s a myth that women get mistreated when it comes to their vehicle service but I experienced it first hand. I could have chose to be an irate customer but because I am a black woman I chose to keep my feelings, emotions, and anger inside and take the poor customer service I received. However, I do have a choice in what type of car I drive and what type of customer service I feel I should receive. I was even just considering upgrading my car. I did not feel valued and I don't think they provide the same level of customer service across the board.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891231ed5d9cf5:0xecab1d88df1cefaa"}

Definitely the best car buying experience I\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 I was given a fair price for my trade, and the sales price of my new car was more than fair.\n\nMy salesman, Beau Beggs, made sure I completely understood every single item during the buying process.\u00a0 He is very well versed in all aspects of the Alfa line, and took the time to ensure I understood the operation of all the new car\u2019s systems.\u00a0 From the time I walked in the door, until the time I drove away I never felt pressured or hurried in any way.\u00a0 For the first time, buying a car was actually enjoyable.\u00a0 Thanks Beau!!\n\nNow I get to brag about the service department manager, Tom Williams.\n\nAbout 800 miles later I was driving home from work when my sunroof blew out for no apparent reason.\u00a0 Needless to say,\u00a0it\u00a0kind of freaked me out.\u00a0 I called Tom while I was still on the interstate.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t avoid the problem, didn\u2019t ask a bunch of questions, and even though it was late in the day, he didn\u2019t suggest any other avenue to solve the problem other than to bring them the car.\u00a0 Because the glass was still falling from the sunroof Tom sent a tow truck to pick up the car and ensured the driver wrapped the car to prevent any further damage.\n\nWhen I arrived at\u00a0Birmingham Alfa\u00a0I found out that all the loaner vehicles were out.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t stop Tom from taking care of the situation.\u00a0 He simply put me into a used car (another Alfa with only 2500 miles) until another Alfa loaner vehicle was available about a week later.\u00a0 In the meantime, Tom communicated the issue with Alfa, and made sure they would take care of the problem, and of course they said they would.\u00a0 I was told parts were on order, and Tom would stay in touch with me as repairs progressed, which Tom did because, well... He\u2019s Tom and he\u2019s the best.\n\nWhen the sunroof blew out the glass hit the trunk and the spoiler, causing several paint chips.\u00a0 I knew they would have to touch up the paint, and that the paintwork would cause the value of the car to depreciate, and talked to Tom about it.\u00a0 I knew he would do whatever he could to remedy to problem.\n\nWhat I DIDN\u2019T expect was what happened next.\n\nI received a call from Tom.\u00a0 He had communicated the issue up the food chain, to include Alfa themselves.\u00a0 The Alfa brand very, very rarely has any issues at all, and they were more than a little surprised to hear of this one.... and they definitely wanted to make things right.\n\nBirmingham Alfa, due in no small part to Tom Williams\u2019 leadership and superb customer service, replaced my car.\u00a0 My\u00a0brand new\u00a0car.\u00a0 With another\u00a0brand new\u00a0car.\u00a0 No hassle, no hoops to jump through, no problems at all.\u00a0 In a word:\u00a0 Amazing.\n\nSo.... I say all that to say\u00a0this;\u00a0 If\u00a0you are looking for a new vehicle (or even a used one) I cannot recommend a dealership more highly than Birmingham Alfa Romeo.\u00a0 Go there, find Beau Beggs, buy something.\u00a0 You will not be disappointed.\u00a0 As a matter of\u00a0fact\u00a0you will be pleasantly surprised in the experience.\n\nSooner or\u00a0later\u00a0you\u2019ll need that vehicle serviced.\u00a0 When you do, take it to no one other than Tom Williams. There is no comparison.\u00a0 I have never been so pleased in the caring customer service he has provided.\u00a0 both on my 2017 Alfa that I traded in, and the new one I am currently enjoying.\n\nI don\u2019t know who actually owns Birmingham Alfa, but if you happen to be reading\u00a0this\u00a0I want you to know you\u2019re doing something right.\u00a0 Keep up the good work, and keep your good people like Tom and Beau.\u00a0 People like them are what keep your\u00a0customers\u00a0 coming\u00a0back.\u00a0 I know I\u2019ll be back, and I\u2019ll keep recommending Birmingham Alfa to others.\n\nThank\u00a0you Beau Beggs, Tom Williams, and Birmingham Alfa, for being the exception to the rule.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891231ed5d9cf5:0xecab1d88df1cefaa"}
