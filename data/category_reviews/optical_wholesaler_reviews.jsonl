Staff and Dr. Harris are always nice and professional.  I don't have vision insurance, but price on visit is always reasonable.  Wait time is a little long but I never make an appointment either.  I'm always a \"walk-in\".  The eyeware part is a bit higher on retail prices for contacts so I choose to buy my contacts online.  They are always nice and helpful in providing my written Rx to purchase my contacts elsewhere.  Overall, I would recommend Dr. Harris @ Marx Optical to anyone looking for a good optometrist.......\n\nUpdate : I have officially quit seeing them after  10+ years.  After sitting waiting for almost 3hours with an eye injury,  I felt as though greater concern should have been given to at least administer a triage type exam to assess the situation,  but none was given.  In much pain,  I decided to leave after nearly 3 hours of waiting, since no concern was given.  I don't know if  my doctor knew that an eye injury was waiting,  but if not, his office staff have been poorly trained to deal with medical necessity Vs.  Standard eye exams.  I have seeked out an ophthalmologist and will begin seeing Dr Cain from now on instead of any optometrist office.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862847643db3f51:0x1eb815f284b146b5"}

I purchased some REALLY nice glasses and contacts. Blew about $450 in there. After my exam and purchase, I asked for my eye test results and PD (pupilairy distance) because my employer requires safety glasses and they will not allow me to wear my daily glasses with side shields. Also, since my employer is so strict on the glasses, they provide me with a free pair every year, but my prescription has to be up to date. The ladies behind the desk refused to give me my exam results because it was against their policy. Basically they didn't want me to take my prescription to a competitor and purchase glasses or contacts. I explained my situation and that I had just spent almost 500 on glasses and contacts (and thats additional to insurance paying 150 toward my frames) with them. Didn't matter. I walked to the back and grabbed the optometrist. He gave me my prescription so I could take it to work. That's like a doctor giving you a physical and not giving you your test results because he's afraid you'll use another pharmacy besides the one in his office! That's CRAZY! THOSE ARE MY MEDICAL RECORDS! I'll never set foot into Marx in Cullman again!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889ca35e56b75d1:0x80078d7d9351dd47"}
