Not only is Sand a great masseuse, but she is an RN who has taken her medical knowledge, and healing qualities to another level.  Opening Restoration Mind Body and Sole was the best decision she ever made, allowing her to completely immerse her mind and soul into treating and creating life changing treatment options for the patients that walk through  her doors.\n\nYesterday she did a lymphatic massage followed by a foot detox to rid my body of all the toxins hat have accumulated for years .  She did this same detox last week and I was overwhelmed and amazed at the results of that initial treatment and the toxins that were extracted from my body.  I simply couldn\u2019t believe what I saw.  That prompted me booking the massage and another foot detox yesterday.\n\nOne thing I immediately noticed when the detox was through was less pain in my joints, hands, and feet.   I especially noticed less tightness in my hands.  One thing she explained to me is that detox draws out all the toxins and inflammations from throughout the body - especially liver and joints .  Inflammation is the culprit of swelling and pain in arthritis.  I felt so much better all week.\n\nYesterday\u2019s appointment   left me more relaxed and destressed than I\u2019ve been in months.  No tension , aches or stress.  Totally peaceful. These two visits have shown me enough about my body and the things we absorb to make me more conscious of taking care of it and treating it better.   I\u2019m certainly not getting any younger .  I am so impressed with these results, that Ive decided to have the colonic cleanse to completely clean out my system and take better control of my health.\n\nThis is a wonderful place, owned by a wonderful person who clearly loves her patients and what she does to help them stay healthy.   The fact that she is an RN is an extra bonus bc she knows the body so well.\n\nPlease give them a call and book your appointment now!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c93124a2470d1:0x1fde73139a3a9402"}

I have been a client of homeopathic practices successfully for quite a long time. After moving to Florence and regrettably having to leave my wellness center back home I was searching for another wellness center that provides the same care. I found Florence Wellness Center and scheduled an appointment for a consult, being familiar with the testing and treatment I was well informed and experienced on what to expect. The EAV device they use is very outdated and known for being used to easily deceive people, it rises and falls at pressure points to show where your body is deficient or over a \u201c50\u201d point mark as too high and the gentleman who was doing the test was very scripted like he was reading from a book on what to say. As the test went on and he began to \u201cdiagnose\u201d my problems I caught on that my numbers would only rise when he dug the instrument harder and harder into the pressure point on my finger to the point that it was extremely sore the following day. He did not speak to me about my past treatment, proceeded to diagnose me with Lyme\u2019s Disease, ADHD, and Hypoglycemia. That was a major red flag for me at this point knowing I am NOT hypoglycemic but rather hyperglycemic and practice homeopathic remedies for Type II Diabetes very successfully to keep my blood sugar at a healthy level. He expressed that I was wrongly diagnosed which is completely absurd and told me I do not have enough sugar in my diet. That kind of diagnosis to someone less experienced with homeopathic remedies and naive is absolutely dangerous and unacceptable! He spoke to me about his own issues with hypoglycemia and how he does not eat properly and sips on a Pepsi throughout the day. At one point put a bottle of Mountain Dew on the machine to show me \u201cproof\u201d of his point. NO and I mean NO true Wellness Center would advocate consuming things like soda and tell clients about their own unhealthy diets. True homeopathic treatment starts at HEALTHY life styles and diet! He was completely wrong about what the St Johns Wort supplement I was taking was even used for which showed me his lack of knowledge in proper supplement support as it is very common and a basic supplement in homeopathy. I believe in homeopathic remedies and have had great success with them with proper care from a truly experienced and professional Wellness Center that can provide good quality supplements and knowledge but this is not the one!! Please be careful before getting scammed into paying $150 for a consult from this \u201cWellness Center\u201d!! Finding a Wellness Center that is knowledgeable about healthy living, clean eating and proper supplement support is life changing! Unfortunately this is not the place to find it!!

I had back surgery in 2009 (L5-S1 discectomy) and was strongly discouraged from running by a PT I saw after my surgery.  I had been feeling pretty good getting back into it, but was worried about possible injury both to my back and knees.  Andrew's running assessment and subsequent muscle strength assessment were extremely helpful.  He gave me a couple of things to change while running to help prevent injury and a list of stretches to strengthen my leg and core muscles.  A few weeks ago I ran my very first half marathon.  A few weeks before that, I had tweaked my back doing something stupid and was afraid I was going to have to give up running the half.  I emailed Andrew who encouraged me that all was not lost.  With his expert advice, I not only ran the whole way, but ran faster than I was expecting!  I have since run a 10K and have 2 more half marathons and a 10-miler on the horizon.\n\nSeriously, make an appointment with Andrew!  For anything!  Not just if you're a runner or athlete.  He can help with normal (and not so normal) life pains, post-surgery issues, etc.  Not only is he knowledgeable about how the body works, but he also takes the time to explain the whats and whys and hows.

Further, he is listens attentively to your problems and does not come across as condescending - even if you make errors in following his advice. He works to get the abnormality under control and then push it to strengthen as much as possible without flaring up it to eventually handle normal activities. I had a nagging hip pain, which he identified as a compressive hamstring tendonopathy from cycling and sitting for long hours on hard lecture hall seats. He addressed the problem by having my sit off of the tendon and on a cushion as much as possible and then progress to strengthening. We overcame the problem in about 2 months. I have also been seeing him about a shoulder injury, which has progressed rather non linearly for about 8 months now.

His approach is very individualized and specific with lots of feedback over email, fb messenger and texting.  I struggled for years with an ongoing hip issue and it got to a point were it interfered not just with sports, but also with my work and daily living. I followed his blogs on social media and finally contacted him in December of 2017.  I am so glad I did!  He responded almost immediately and as soon as I had a referral I was good to go. He assessed my strength and abilities and identified multiple problems.  He methodically works on one issue at the time and helps me build my hip strengths up.  Instead of going 3 days a week for several weeks (which is really hard to do if you are working), I was set up over a longer period of time (once a week, then twice a month, then 4 weeks/6 weeks later).  The phone exercise app he provides, allows me to track the exercises I have to do.  He is very encouraging especially at times when I think I'm not making any progress and teaches you self release methods to relieve pain.  I am now into my 4th month of therapy  (6th visit) and I'm running again!  My hip feels stronger and I'm looking forward to many more miles on trails and roads in the future.  Andrews approach does take self motivation because you have to do the work on your own rather than at office setting for an hour 3 days a week.  But being pain free is a great motivator.  So if doctors visits haven't worked out for you, I would highly recommend you contact Andrew.

I had bought my Trifecta Pass just a few weeks prior after assuring myself that I would recover in time to race.  After weeks of ineffective self care I went to my family doctor. After an X-ray and no real good advice they referred me to an orthopedic doctor. He confirmed I didn\u2019t have anything major and gave me the same useless advice and a prescription ointment that didn\u2019t do much. By this time it was all I could do to walk around the house. I was heartbroken to think that I wouldn\u2019t be able to race. Thankfully I found Andrew through his insightful Facebook posts and gave him a call last January. His wholistic and long term vision for getting better and staying better was exactly what I was looking for. The running analysis he provided revealed so many things that could have stalled my fitness goals indefinitely had they been left unaddressed.  I travel a lot for work as well, so his \u201cwork on your own\u201d method for physical therapy exercises rather than multiple visits per week was a perfect way for me to augment my existing exercise routine without disrupting my work schedule. By March I was able to finish the Atlanta Sprint race - still walking more than I wanted but at least I was on the course and it only took about 30 minutes more than usual.  After about 5 or 6 visits I had made good progress and was on my way to pain free running. By July I was able to run the Asheville Super and only had to pace myself a bit on the downhill portion towards the end of the race.  In August I started having shin splints.  I reached out to Andrew via Facebook Messenger and within an hour had a new set of exercises that took care of the problem in a few weeks.  No \u201cmake an appointment with the receptionist\u201d or other nonsense like that.  The last time I had shin splints they lingered for months and the only advice I got from my doctor was to take a few Advil every day and stop exercising - not an option for me. Now in November I was able to run the Carolina Beast without any pain.  Achieving this goal would not have happened without Andrew\u2019s help and seemed impossible when I was limping out of the store with a knee brace last December.\nAt first I was worried about not being able to have insurance cover my therapy. In retrospect, the investment I made with PhysioWorks is going to save me so much money in the long run.  Andrew\u2019s approach was exactly what this Spartan needed to finally join the Trifecta Tribe.  If you\u2019re an Obstacle Course Racer and have any pain that\u2019s keeping you off the course, I highly recommend you give PhysioWorks a try. Andrew works with a local Crossfit business as well, so he can help with more than just running.\nThanks Andrew!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509839627753, "text": "Thanks Tag!

He takes chiropractor care to levels no one has ever heard of in this town. Let's be real for a moment, almost every who's had pain at some point in their life has gone to a chiropractor for help. The standard way of thinking is that if you could just get that elbow to pop back or to have a hip or shoulder reset then all your pain would go away. But it never works, you might find some mild relief but it's usually short lived by a couple of hours to maybe days and then you wake up and say, you slept wrong and it's out again.\n\nWell the team at Invision chiropractic care will teach you how to do address the underlying problems so you can fix it yourself in the long run. Yes you will get adjusted, yes it will probably hurt (Dr. Aplin has a different approach to adjusting that I've ever seen) but I'm a walking, breathing, significantly less pain and overall stress less person than when I walked into his office 4 months ago.\n\nI'll be honest, I have a long history of surgeries to pains and only walked in to this office cause I didn't want to have another surgery and my dear friend suggested Dr. Aplin. I went when I truly didn't believe he was helping. I went when the pain spread to a neighboring body part. I went even though my TOC doc said I needed surgery to fix my problem. 4 months and I never missed an appointment. I can say today that I don't need surgery, my pain is gone and the results of becoming less stressed and worry free was worth more to me than the pain getting better.\n\nBrainTap. Google it. Dr. Aplin introduced me to it and has changed my life because of it. I feel like I have the answer to a life long question that I know so many of us ask \"How do I feel better?\" yes that's generic but let's be honest, everyone is stressing about something these days. But after 4 months of using the BrainTap and doing my homework from Dr. Aplin, I do feel better, lighter able to take on what the world throws at me.

Im afraid of the outcome of this transaction.\nI just want to cancel my appointment and request a FULL refund because i have NO intentions on driving to Atlanta, ESPECIALLY when there was no special notices or disclaimer addressing the address change posted on their website! I am unable to drive to Atlanta.  I will be calling upon posted open business hours to cancel and request a refund.\nI REALLY hate this!!!!! I REALLY want only the best for black owned business but we MUST do better in the customer service arena. I will be back with a follow up from this review.\nThank you reviewers who left your personal experiences for newbies like myself.\nSunnie", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919a0ee645351:0xb59b4358188dcc76"}

Whether it's scheduling an appointment, or needing to bring the kids with me, the staff is always helpful.\nOne thing that stands out about Amanda's chiropractic care which separates her from other chiropractors, is she is always going to seminars and learning the latest techniques.

The safety of children in our care is of utmost importance to the Y. I do thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. Our counselor should have ensured that your daughter was delivered to her soccer coach, and she was not. After reviewing our security camera footage, we did find that when your daughter was walked to the soccer field, the Southeast YMCA Sports Support Staff Member was present and other children were engaged with their coaches in soccer practice at that time (4:59 p.m.), but your daughter's coach was not present. At 5:03 p.m., a counselor walked your daughter back inside to her Afterschool group. At no time during this footage did we observe counselors or sports staff on their cell phones. We have taken appropriate action with the counselor involved and are reviewing our policies and procedures with all Afterschool staff to ensure that this does not happen again. We look forward to seeing your daughter again today for Afterschool care and thank you for allowing us to continue to serve your family.  Kind regards, Bev Snellgrove, District Executive Director, Southeast Family YMCA"}, "gmap_id": "0x88621285a4c529fb:0x38953d8c3300db10"}

They truly care about their patients. The thoroughness the whole staff exhibits is also shocking. They make sure everything is covered and you leave without pain. They ask after every session if it was okay. They are helpful, kind, and patient when I am confused or struggling. They also remember little details about my personal life and ask me about them every time I\u2019m there.

The office manager at this business is ABSOLUTELY THE MOST RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL PERSON I HAVE EVER SPOKEN TOO. I came in probably 7 months ago, It was my first visit to ever see a chiropractor, and was in a lot of pain. I paid like $150-$175  that day just because I told them SPECIFICALLY that I did not want a bill in the mail and I would pay whatever that day just to go ahead and get it out of the way. I saw Dr. Jumper and he was very nice and helpful. I thought that I was going to be very pleased with my experience. 6 MONTHS LATER, I received a bill in the mail from them asking me for $35. Soon after I received the bill in the mail I gave them a call to ask some questions about my bill. She began to tell me that I still owed $35 and that the lady that I was working with got fired because of doing stuff like this and not charging me the full amount. I begin to tell her what I paid that day and I asked specifically if I could take care of it the day of the visit. I then asked her if she could just take care of it for me because it was not my mistake it was the employees. Her tone immediately changed and she said \"You still have to pay your bill regardless and if you don't we will be reporting you to collections.\" I tried to explain to her that I am a loyal customer and I just do not think it is right for me to have to pay this and she kept talking over me and raising her voice. THEN, SHE HUNG UP ON ME. Today I receive a phone call from the business and I was on the other line and could not answer, and immediately call back, and no answer. The point of the matter is, IF YOU ARE RUNNING A LOCAL BUSINESS, YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE YOUR CLIENTELE. IF AN EMPLOYEE DOES SOMETHING WRONG, YOU DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED. REGARDLESS. If you are looking for a local chiropractor DO NOT go to this business unless you are wanting to get SCAMMED. It was not the money aspect, but the fact they were not worried about satisfying the customer and doing what is right.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1524498735553, "text": "Erika Berry, we're very sorry to hear about your experience.
