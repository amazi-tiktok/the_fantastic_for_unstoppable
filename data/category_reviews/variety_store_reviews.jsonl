To be followed around a store bc of the color of my skin. So to make matters worse after asking Carrie the manager where I could find a polo she told me the thrift store. So then I told her I was going to be India . Carrie was furious. She berated me and told me and all the other customers in the store it was their job to follow people that are stealing around dollar tree as if I was stealing . She yelled that India was doing her job and that it didn't matter which color the person was. Making it seem as if I am a thief. I'm in total disbelief bc I've known Carrie the manager for years. But the way she acted and talked to me tonight amongst other shoppers was ridiculous, mentally scarring, and just plain bad for business. I literally shop in dollar tree every single day. But this could all be changed very soon . Thanks to Carrie having a bad day. Then to make the situation my worst yet this year. I was apologizing to the cashier ringing me up telling her I knew the objectives of their job bc I was offered a management position about a year ago and had a application for the job in my car . Carrie the manager walks out and tells me to shut up and that the conversation is basically over. I said Carrie I was not talking to you I was speakkng to the cashier. I think it's sad when a person brings their personal life to work. I know Carrie has problems at home. So I told her I didn't know what she bad going on but I knew this wasn't her .
