Twice I booked at charter at two different locations we were vacationing at, once at lower Mobile Bay and the other time at Dauphin Island. How he can find fish to catch no matter where he is amazes me!\nThe other time we have been fishing with Patric was on Christmas Eve day, wind blowing, cold, but we filled the cooler with delicious white and speckled trout!\nDon't think the price of the Ugly Fishing's charters are expensive. Patric works hard to make sure you have a great time and he has quite a lot of money tied up in his boat and tackle.\nPatric is a humble guy but he is top-notch in my opinion. Whether you are a seasoned fisherman or a first timer, don't hesitate to give Patric a call.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHIA5_5tE8oSHkHxlqPeEhzbEAbsDePiVu4_ji=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1510441145446, "text": "Thank you so much for the review Kyle.
