After escalating the issue DR Horton had the flooring manufacturer come out and inspect the floors, which resulted in them telling us they would repair the floors where needed and extend our warranty for 6 months. The flooring rep came out to look at what needed to be repaired and told us they were fairly sure the flooring had been installed before our A/C was installed - and it all needed to be ripped out and it wouldn't be possible to just repair all 12 spots where it was ridging. The regional manager now wants to get another flooring installer to come out since the original one won't repair it.

When entering the neighborhood Truland Homes owns the lots immediately to the left, and all of the lots on the right hand side of the neighborhood, with the exclusion of the DR Horton model home.\n\nSecondly, the homes are spaced out at least twenty feet between each other, with a ten foot minimum setback on the sides of the homes to the property line, and at least 30 feet from the home to the front or back of the property line.\n\nMany neighborhoods in Baldwin County have the two predominate builders working in conjunction with each other to give buyers options. Firethorne, Jubilee Farms, Stonebridge and more both have DR Horton and Truland Homes building. This is a trend that will continue to give buyers a wider range of pricing and selections.\n\nBlackstone Lakes is one of the most affordable and convenient neighborhoods Truland offers in Daphne. Square footages range from a little over 1900 square feet to over 2800 square feet, so there is something for everyone.\n\nHope this helps!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwwRonSlAhy8eYlkUtJj8pxe6SbTDLJMB889Hn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a417a7f2c0a2b:0x34e95473da2ea6a3"}

After escalating the issue DR Horton had the flooring manufacturer come out and inspect the floors, which resulted in them telling us they would repair the floors where needed and extend our warranty for 6 months.

The regional manager now wants to get another flooring installer to come out since the original one won't repair it.

We're retiring from NY to SW Alabama and signed with Heritage Family Homes to build the Warwick on our land after numerous builder inquiries and reviews. Being 1300 miles away caused some great anxiety. The staff in this office made us feel like we were their only project.\nThe job supervisor stayed in constant contact sending phots of updates and continuously asked questions for approval before moving onto the next step. When a family emergency arose for the supervisor, Heritage called me immediately and gave me contact numbers for his substitutes. The super even coordinated a few extra requests with his contractors such as extra concrete for the driveway and extra soil spreading for the final outdoor clearing (We did pay for the extra but Heritage did the coordination for me).\nWe paid for upgrades and a screen porch on the Warwick, which really wasn't that expensive. We moved interior walls during the planning stage actually flipping the kitchen location, removed the tub from the master bath and put in a walk-in shower, removed a window from one wall and put it on another & put the garage door onto the front of the house due to yard space at no additional costs. From ground breaking until closing took 8 months with an extremely wet Alabama winter.\nAll said & done, Heritage came in about $30K lower than the next reliable builder. There were others but reviewing the complaints filed with Baldwin County on them really limited our choices. We were never pressured for progressive payments until we were completely satisfied.\nThe only reason I didn't offer 5 stars is that I had to arrange for gutters and basic landscaping (Sod and some extra property grading) because it wasn't offered.

Not to mention, after the first year we began to see cracks in the ceiling. We contacted the warranty department and because they weren't a certain length they wouldn't do anything about them. Now, about 5  years later they are way worse. We have even considered seeking legal action due to the fact we are worried that there is structural damage. We also paid about $1,200 extra to have them paint our home one neutral color, not knowing they would use the poorest quality paint. We can't even wipe our walls without the paint coming off. Honestly from the texture and appearance it just looks like primer. Lastly, anytime I call the office with any questions the guy whom answers is not knowledgeable of anything and sends me to someone's voicemail to either get a phone call back a week or more later or never. Being in the customer service industry, I am a firm believer that you should treat the customer(s) how you would want to be treated especially when they are spending thousand of dollars on a home. I am not impressed at all with this company and how they deal with problem issues.

First and most importantly, The HOA board or staff needs to work on professionalism and handling situations case by case. It clearly states in the covenants that fences will not be brought forward except in special circumstances. They would not even discuss my case, just redirected me back to the covenants like I hadn\u2019t already read them. Plus, most of the time, a fence is for privacy. I could care less about the right side of my home, but not being able to have my son\u2019s bedroom window inside the fence for security and privacy reasons is crazy to me.\nThe other thing I would greatly recommend is improving the design center/appointment. A design room where we can see EVERYTHING, and not the just basic options, would cut down on the confusion and disappointment after the home is finished. I was blindly choosing things I wouldn\u2019t have if I could\u2019ve seen what I was choosing before hand. A full design center with every option available visible to the buyer would help a lot.\nI love my home. There are major things I would do differently next time around, but overall, the quality of my home is excellent and my team was exceptional. I loved my community manager and project manager Ryan and Logan. They were the best of the best.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615211506253, "text": "Hi Taylor,\n\nWe apologize that you feel your experience with us has been anything less than excellent.

Jerry Lamb is the man on the ground that oversaw the actual building process and kept me well informed and did his best to make sure I was happy with the final process.

{"user_id": "117234347493630291856", "name": "Katelyn G", "time": 1602178484091, "rating": 2.0, "text": "Updating my final review of Davidson Homes despite their attempt to have me sign a disclosure that I will no longer say anything negative about their company since they fixed the issues. This paper also stated that since they are committed to excellent customer service that they would cover \"cosmetic\" items not normally covered. It should be very clearly stated that the items were not cosmetic and actually a manufacturing defect that never should have been approved by their supers. After nearly 10 months of owning the house, our 60 day warranty items are finally resolved.\u00a0Summary of issues that are now fixed --leaking chimney that caused severe damage upstairs and downstairs (took 7 months to be tarp free), water intrusion in the garage (claimed to not be considered a defect despite not being present in any other homes), cracked/misaligned window/door casings, manufacturer defect on marble vanity top that was supposed to be replaced before move in (attempted to not cover because it's \"cosmetic\").\n\nMy biggest frustration with them still reigns true despite the thorough completion by Chris Thompson--the amount of time and effort it took to get these things resolved is excessive and shouldn't have been necessary. The (majority of) representatives within Davidson have been friendly throughout the process including Ana Siersma, Chris Thompson, and Chad Vader. Although their production manager could use some people skills and learn to accept that in an instance such as this, the customer has every right to complain without being argued with; or without being met with rebuttals or attempted justification for all the issues or an attempt to silence their right to review. The good news for new homebuyers is that there are new managers in all departments and they will likely never need to personally interact with the production manager, but this unfortunately didn't make it any easier for all of the existing homeowners and I won't personally be able to speak on that. It may seem like I'm holding a grudge or I keep bringing up issues they fixed, and truthfully I should be allowed given the severe damage, unusability of our living spaces, and headache caused with the excessive timeline of repairs; but it's not just us with issues, I have yet to speak to a neighbor who has not had major frustrations with Davidson. So yes, I am happy that our issues are fixed, but there's no way to get rid of the bitter taste given the disaster that we were presented. However, according to a particular production manager and management who presented what can only be described as a non-disclosure since Davidson agreed to fix issues not ordinarily covered under warranty, the repairs are made so I should stop complaining. And yes, everyone has apologized profusely (some with \"buts\" attached to it) but that didn't change the outcome. And doesn't eliminate snarky comments such as \"this is why you have a home warranty\" or \"you wouldn't have been able to close on time if these were identified before\". Difference is, if we didn't close on time, it's not me, the customer, losing money having to pay a mortgage, it's Davidson.\n\nThe one thing that has been brought up multiple times (including our final meeting) that is one of my biggest annoyances is that we signed off on a preclose walkthrough stating there weren't the issues we're now pointing out. Our options on walkthrough were to accept that they're saying the work they did was satisfactory or not close on time. There was no in between, compromise, or room to question their work. It's not a good business practice to put homeowners in that situation and it's also worse that no one's really owned up to knowing/acknowledging that is an area of improvement and would rather argue the point. Maybe I have too high of standards coming from Florida where you don't have to choose the best of the worst which is what Huntsville/Madison is (not just me who has these sentiments, I promise). I hope that we can now enjoy owning this home because I really do l love our floorplan.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg74vRXko9572NJGY_DZ3QECcJ3DTnhspgfLXS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeCHolP-SAbHk1LBUMHn7H8GsRwRMwNNufF9S0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGzNTZwD9JdPQ1dF73EhYG30KnnYaXBDk7fkiC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMWgLVQ3r3XyuQO_rZLVijjjH-uXlswV8R0T-p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMedjz0c6vua5yUltOSUxvLGKRn7lZs0yw8ldmM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7N9tBJrbYYKMwNyHLPzw9Xhe3MmSVvpxfLnWW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg9dDOYNiJlIYfyTWDP5mCxqol2PyOtSz6CY4V=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0xT9ddYOcwZlXm-5KEdJeTjl790ErdKN-Igp1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyqfKx1ihP2LEt2zLvqDFs9aqRbG_YhdeWRpVA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1602184862246, "text": "Hi Katelyn,\n\nWe apologize that you feel your experience with us has been anything less than excellent.

We\u2019ve battled through this issue the entire summer and it continues today. I\u2019m tired of Davidson sending people over here who don\u2019t know anymore about the issue or resolving the issue than we do. We cannot and will not continue to have our AC down to 69\u2022 or lower to accommodate our room when it causes the rest of our downstairs to feel like an icebox.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure what was done incorrectly but we do know that something is obviously wrong and we\u2019re not sure why Davidson is not staying on top of the issue until it\u2019s resolved. We shouldn\u2019t have to keep contacting you all when you know that there\u2019s been no resolution.  Here it is at 0400 in the morning and I\u2019m awakened because of the uncomfortable, hot and muggy temperature in our bedroom as the remainder of the house is significantly cooler. The disparity is much more than just a few degrees difference from one room to the other.\n\nWe don\u2019t need anyone else to come here and to basically tell us that this is just how it is and this is normal because it\u2019s not! We\u2019ve withstood 100 plus degree weather for several months at a time in our house in Texas (temperatures were extreme) and never had this to happen. The temperature was significantly the same from one level of our house to the next; one room to the next. Similar square footage.\n\nDavidson\u2019s gotten away with putting terrible sod down in our yard and never watering or treating it but this will not be overlooked. We\u2019ve watched each and everyone of our neighbors yards get treated with the proper, upmost care for weeks at a time while we\u2019ve dealt with stony, brick laid horrible looking sod/grass. I\u2019m assuming since we didn\u2019t have a \u201cSean\u201d working on our property, we\u2019ve gotten the short end of the stick.\n\nIf we had to do it over again, we wouldn\u2019t. Starting with the initial person of contact for the build.\n\nLet us know what Davidson\u2019s plans are to rectify this situation.\n\nI must note that Ana has been the most positive experience that I\u2019ve had with Davidson thus far. I appreciate her customer service, communication, and willingness to help. I only wish that she\u2019d been the realtor (I do know that she\u2019s not a realtor) and that Sean had been the project manager when we started this venture.\n\nRegards,\nDZ\n\nThis is the email that I sent to Davidson Homes and no one has reached out to us to discuss or to resolve the issues.  Davidson has treated us more like an inconvenience than as customers. We should\u2019ve backed out of the deal when we initially started working with the realtor to build our plan but we went against our better judgement. Our options were not explained at all, nor were they laid out for us as they were for others in other Davidson builds. We were brushed off when we asked for details about upgrades or options. This has led us to make decisions based off of a lack of information and available options. The sod that they laid was ridiculous and they would not help us to get our grass up to part as they did for all of our neighbors. Unfortunately for us, we were the first to purchase and to move into our neighborhood and we\u2019re paying for it in the end. Davidson has put more care and concern in the neighboring homes and not putting any effort in meeting our needs today. Our master bedroom and bath stays very humid and hot and we have no explanation or understanding as to why it\u2019s that way. It feels like we\u2019re walking into the garage or the attic at times.\n\nWe\u2019re very disappointed in our new investment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602506039371, "text": "Hi Daphne,\n\nWe apologize that you feel your experience with us has been anything less than excellent.

My only complaint was that she pointed out the ethernet in the model home as a selling point (or maybe I just noticed them and commented on it), but the actual ports are not installed in your home (just pre-wired) because \"everyone uses wifi these days\". This should have been brought up during the design meeting, but since it wasn't, I'm having to wire up my own connections. Not a big deal, just slightly annoying.\n\nThe bigger issue (more a problem with Heritage Mortgage) is if you're doing a VA loan, Davidson Homes / Heritage Mortgage will lie to you. They consider any VA non-allowable fees (borrower CAN'T pay) that the seller pays instead, to be a seller concession that counts toward their $3000 concession for using their services. So fees I'm not allowed to pay are somehow a \"concession\" to me. Total BS that cost me about $900. Good thing they had me fill out their survey prior to closing, because I left them a good review.

Was told a full sod back yard and the back yard has at least 4 large trees, 1 of which is a giant pine tree with limbs hanging over the house, one cluster of 12 small ones, and another cluster of 5 or so.  We asked them to let us cut the small ones and they cut the pine tree.  They told us no and we would have to wait until closing...WHEN THE BRAND NEW HOUSE IS UP!  We also explained to them that sod will not live under all of that shade, but they don\u2019t care because they aren\u2019t the ones going to live there!   Chantae lied and said the backyard would be bigger than the model home, well that might be, but a jungle was not what was represented!  She first said she didn\u2019t say that at all, then later said it was taken out of context.  They are all out to cover their own behinds.\n\nNow the windows are in, we noticed that the front window has grids.  We requested no grids at the design meeting.  We asked about it today, they said that the front window having grids is standard and there would have had to been an up charge to have no grids on that window.  This was NEVER mentioned before when we requested to have NO GRIDS.  Logan with Davidson Homes told us we can just go to Wilson Lumber when the house is closed on and buy a new  insert without grids and pop the glazing bead out to change it out ourselves. Once again taking no responsibility for it themselves.  Customer service isn\u2019t even in their vocabulary.

Out of all their models, I think it has the best and most affordable floor plan. I really enjoyed the experience of being able to choose all the colors and our new home consultant Chantae did an amazing job at providing her input and answering any questions we had. We also chose to use Davidson\u2019s provided realtor (which is free) and the realtor was super helpful (USE THEIR REALTOR). She updated us on the progress of the house and took videos and pictures. For the most part, everything was smooth and easy... almost too easy. The construction manager, Jerry, was very helpful and took his time to insure the house was closed and finished in a timely manner, all while insuring the tegrity and quality of the house was up to par.\n\nCONS: We visited the house several time to insure changes we made were being implemented. (Took the advice from another review and I\u2019m glad we did.) There were several key features and changes we had asked for that were being overlooked on the addendum. I think the root of the issue was due to our construction managers changing, however be mindful if you do have a lot of add-on and changes, try and check up on the house once a week or so.\n\nWHAT I WOULD CHANGE: There were things that I feel should be standard that weren\u2019t such as: numbers on the house other than just on the mailbox, a garbage disposal, gutters, and window screens (all can be added for extra cost).  There should be a choice as to what the \u201cplant package\u201d includes. The randomization is pretty... random and the plants were basically dead by move in time.\n\nIn all, the experience with Davidson was fun and exciting. You can tell that the people you work with along the way really care about their job and about you.

Because of Davidson Homes I will spend Christmas 2018 sleeping on someone's floor instead of in the new home I contracted to have built. Why? Because the contractor blames the city of Madison instead of admitting they tried to take shortcuts.  My original completion date was suppose to be in October. Then a closing date was set for Nov 12. A few days before closing I received a call telling me the backyard failed engineering inspection due to flooding. This was an issue that I had asked about before I purchased the property and asked about during the building process after visiting the site when it rained. I was told it was \"OK\" Then the home would not pass inspection. Davidson let the property sit for over a month with no work being done. I was told they would put a retention wall in November by Jake Blagburn.  After extending my monthly lease on my apartment 3 times I was forced to move out or pay more than double rent because I was month to month. I contacted the Sales manager Lou Paratore at Davidson and asked to help put me up in lodging. He flat out said \"NO\" you have to pay to live somewhere. Which is true. Yet Davidson Homes cannot give me a date as to when the home I gave them a down payment would be ready.!He then explains that work would began maybe the week before Christmas and maybe the home would be done sometime in January. I am offered no compensation only apologies. Yet for Christmas and New years I am sleeping on the floor on a air mattress while paying for storage.

My wife spent a week (a solid 40 plus hours) trying to satisfy the requirements of the mortgage company. She couldn\u2019t so she called to tell the salesman that we would be unable to purchase the home. He replied with, well send me what you have, I usually deal with them anyway. So the mortgage got approved. I was told by my salesman that he had gotten us approved with no payment for 90 days. One of the guys at the mortgage company actually laughed when I told him I was told 90 days no payment. We go sign papers 4/21 and cannot sign the papers in our home because they have started prepping it for delivery. We had to be out of the house we were renting so ok, this should be quick and easy. We were told a few weeks to MOVE in. It took a month just to deliver a ready home!That was 5/15. We moved in 6/10. I asked the salesman while looking him in the eyes if I would need to arrange to have the power, water, or septic tank connected. His reply to me was \u201cno, we handle all that and it\u2019s financed in\u201d.\nSo Regional sends a man out to make our dirt pad. Supposed to be paid for in the mortgage. Guy says we need 17 loads of dirt and that we will have to either get the dirt or we could pay him around $2000 on top of what Regional was paying him for the pad work. Our lot is not that Unlevel to start with. We hired our own guy who did the pad and supplied the dirt for what Regional was going to pay their guy. They called our guy 4 times a day for a week till it got done. We are then told it was going to be another week before they delivered our home. That week comes and we are told for 5 straight days \u201c it\u2019s gonna be delivered tomorrow, I promise\u201d and it didn\u2019t show till the end of the following week. And my wife drove an hour one way every day to meet them as she was told one of us would need to be there.So we get the septic tank installed and the water meter installed. We call our salesman to let him know and we are told that we have to provide someone to hook that up. So we get power and make the call to get our AC installed. No reply for over a week. We try to reach the general manager and can only leave messages because he is always busy and apparently doesn\u2019t return calls between meeting (or ever). On day 3 of asking for him, the guy says, you keep calling, is there something I can help you with?. So we find out that he is the guy who arranges the AC and underpinning and finish work. He claims he hasn\u2019t been told we had power and were ready for AC install and underpinning but he would get right on it even though three days before my wife had texted the salesman and he said he\u2019d let them know.He called back 3 days later and said he had it set up for Monday. Monday comes and is almost gone so we call him back. He says he doesn\u2019t know where they are and gives us the number to the AC company. They advised us that they had nothing scheduled for us to install. They simply told him they would have the unit in stock on Monday. Now the AC folks did a great job. They had a cancellation and came a day earlier than the appointment they made with us actually. I am about to make my second payment and the house is still not underpinned and we have heard nothing from the manufacturer as to when they are coming to fix all the broken drawers and the screwed up electrical. If you turn off the light outside the laundry room door to the outside, none of the lights in the living room will work.\nLong story I know but I will live in a cardboard box before I buy another home from Regional Mobile Homes in Northport. We are now being told it will be another 2 to 3 weeks before they come do our underpinning. Oh and there is absolutely nothing holding this home to the ground. No straps or anchors. The Alabama Mobile Home  commission  says that it acceptable , but I have never seen a mobile home in Alabama that wasn\u2019t strapped and anchored. They will do the minimum they can do. Not above and beyond like they say on the website.

Our sales person, James, was not knowledgeable enough to be on his own yet and got openly angry and upset that we had questions and asked for clarification on important steps. Financial person, Heath, flat out stated that they didnt care about our business because they were busy already. Information about the buying process was not shared up front. And prices 'increase' suspiciously. We even called other companies to check this info and this was not the case. Beware! Buying a home is a HUGE decision that costs a lot of money! these people are not professional and are not trustworthy. Go somewhere else!\n\nThis company will waste your time and are sleazy as grease. dont let them get a hold of your money! We were almost ready to sign with them after months of strained communication and a growing uneasy feeling in my gut, when they threw out some pretty big requirements we were never told about over 6 months of talking and preparing for a real, serious home purchase. contractors were lined up and everything. We were told prices had increased magically per foot in the house the week prior and that it required a 10% deposit on the value of the home before building...we called around to other mobile home sites and they reacted like this was the normal, to get these phone calls about this company, Cumberland Homes. Evidently we are not the first people they have done this to. the other mobile home companies in Alabama STRONGLY cautioned us that no prices had changed due to the annual convention, everything was status quo, and what they are suggesting is an unethical and NOT practiced requirement of a 10% deposit on top of the down payment for your home mortgage. You have been warned, people.\n\n**update in response to company comment**\nno sir, I am simply being thorough in my review. i have not used any \"fictitious name\". i simply left the same review on facebook and google. what my review states is truth. you seem to be having the tantrum because people are responding to my review with similar experiences until you took down the reviews on facebook. Let me be clear. I am not worried about you. I have not given you a second thought. i simply shared my experience to warn others. looks like yall are still stuck on it. interesting. you can speak whatever things that make you sleep better at night. I am not bitter, I am not mad, i am simply sharing the truth. I am GLAD it didnt work out now. you can excuse what you did all the ways you wish, you cannot take it back. STOP WASTING MY TIME AND MAKING YOURSELF EVEN LESS PROFESSIONAL. learn from your actions. evidently yall have reputation  that follows your company name. so sad.\n\nAlso, the \"cousin\" you mentioned is aware of everything and has been very cautious with you. he stayed simply because of pricing, not because he was impressed by your business. i hope you treated him better, though! it seems like it. Learning from mistakes is great.\n\nLastly, something to note. I only add more detail to my review when you respond unprofessionally....", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568215950176, "text": "Ok,   You have already left one Review under a fictitious name and used the same type rhetoric.  Concerning the price increases,  Different Manufactured home dealers have different business arrangements with the factories based on volume and other factors so you have no idea as to what you are talking about concerning our pricing or any other Manufactured Home dealership.  Look Kayla we made a decision not to do business with you based on your behavior is the truth of the matter and this type of response from you just validates our decision.  What it seems like you are doing is simply having a tantrum because you didn't get your way.  No company wants to turn down business for obvious reasons but in your case we felt we had no choice.  Yes deposits are required on special order homes that nobody else would ever want if for some reason you can't or don't go through with the purchase is not unreasonable in our opinion.  This is the type of behavior that helped us make a decision not to do business with you and we don't regret that decision by any means.   It seems like the timing of this review is very suspicious since your cousins home will be delivering very soon and they have been very reasonable and great to work with through the whole process and we truly hope they enjoy their new home for many years to come.

This was the first home that I\u2019ve purchased in the area and I definitely won\u2019t buy another from this company. I had no clue what I was in for, but if I could save someone else the devastation, DO NOT DO IT!!\n\nA BRAND NEW HOME with NUMEROUS issues one could not even make up, all of which is a result from the obvious lack of pride and quality in their work. I am going to refrain from posting a book of a review and what energy I do have left and just say DO NOT purchase a home from Benchmark. Throw your money on the ground and walk away. Better yet, donate it to a good cause so you can at least feel good about the choice that you have made. I do hope someone takes these reviews seriously in their consideration when purchasing a home. Once I actually thought things were going to get taken care of, little did I know that this headache is never ending!! From Sheetrock seams present all over the house, to plumbing leaks, window leaks, wall bulges, fraying and dented doors, and the list goes on....all I\u2019ve gotten is excuses as to why things are this way in order to get me to believe that these mishaps are ok and normal in a brand new home!!! NOT the case!! I\u2019ve owned a brand new home previously in a different area and still to this day, 9 years later, I would make a bet you still could not find this type of work in that home.\n\nIf you have not gotten the message yet, you should by now!! However, let me add that NONE of this was able to be seen prior to moving in. So do yourself a favor upfront and do not even go this route, because 3 months of living in the house and things are only getting worse.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a417b7392656f:0xbe8f82fed27641c8"}

From the beginning we had issues getting calls returned or obtaining information. This should have been an obvious red flag, but we avoided our instincts and have sorely regretted it since.\n\nBenchmark obviously does not stand behind their product based on my experience thus far. They are not concerned with you as a customer . Once you've closed, good luck getting anything fixed. The \"Superintendent\" is an excuse machine from walkthrough to present day. The \"warranty\" department will provide you with vague generalizations and open ended time frames. If you're considering Benchmark, just toss your money out the window, it would be much more efficient.\n\nYour closing will likely be delayed because they forgot to submit something, or do something, or just simply needed a day off. These are primarily guesses on my part because we were told nothing. We never were provided insight on the revolving closing date, until the 11th hour on the 3rd scheduled closing date. Eventually we found out our initial date passed because the COO was not submitted properly, and then the house failed inspection. Our closing was repeatedly delayed and their solution was for us to wait it out or walk, they didn't care.

This, by the way, is the replacement work. The first installed crown molding did the same thing (started falling apart) within six months after I moved in.  The \"replacement\" took so long that the one year warranty had expired.\n\nI complained about this in February, when my house was approximately 14 months old, and the superintendent came to my house to view the problem.  He said that the ceiling was  unlevel and that this was causing the problem.  He asked what days worked for me and said he would send some of his crew, which was working out of town at the moment, to fix the problem.  It's almost August, and I have yet to hear another word from the superintendent to schedule a repair.\n\nSince I am beyond the period covered by the 2-10 home warranty, which is basically garbage anyway and only designed to protect the builder from litigation, I am stuck with the burden of correcting Benchmark's faulty work.\n\nChoosing Benchmark Homes is one of the biggest regrets in my life.

There\u2019s so many things we\u2019ve found wrong and have added to the warranty to get fixed...too many things in my opinion that should have been done correctly the first time. Like we wouldn\u2019t notice! I think the problem is that Truland has so many houses being built at once and not enough supervision on site to go around. This has caused many of the issues we\u2019ve discovered with the home. For things to be corrected on site they have to be discovered when they occur, not months later, not at the last minute right before closing. For initial walkthrough to closing, the 7 days Truland gives is not nearly enough time to fix things. Ultimately, for as much as we paid for our home, we were expecting much better quality/finishing of build. Also, the community pool (Cypress Village) is an absolute joke. All the listing/internet photos falsely advertise this feature. I\u2019m sure it was once a gorgeous pool and lazy river but the lack of maintenance over the years is obvious. We had to sign a waiver from the HOA that we wouldn\u2019t sue if we were injured there. Attempting to use the slide, we soon found out why. Also, the cypress trees as you enter the community are dying. I hope this is not a sign of the future of this community. I know this falls on the HOA, but as far as I understand it, Truland still has oversight of these items. These are low points from our Truland experience. On the positive, we are happy to be in Orange Beach and the community seems very safe with lots to do.

From the first interaction we had until the most recent as of yesterday, the employees at Brock Point have been dishonest with us. Once they lock you in through their deceitful sales tactics you are along for a horrible ride.\n\nWe were told 7-8 months from Contract to Close (possibly 6). After revised dates after revised dates it now stands at 11 1/2 months to Close. All we keeping getting from Signature Homes is they are behind schedule with no recovery plan or attempt to make up any time. They continue to work on spec homes while people who have Contracts wait. This occurred with many people in Brock Point and continues.\n\nThe amount of quality issues has been enormous. From plumbing being placed in the wrong location in the slab (required jacking up the floor) to retaining walls being poured too high to the house being painted the wrong color, it has been a comedy of errors. The framing was a complete QC nightmare with more issues than I can type. We can only imagine what\u2019s left to come.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many choices in the Hoover School District to build a new home. However, we suggest looking long and hard at other subdivisions. It is possible other Signature Homes subdivisions aren\u2019t this bad, but is unlikely given the people we have spoken to and conducted meetings with control the overall company. Good luck to all those that still have homes to build with Brock Point!\n\nEDIT: We officially moved in 2 weeks ago after 11 1/2 months from Contract.

I was initially supposed to have my pre-construction meeting in January. Unfortunately, my family had an unexpected death the same week and had to reschedule. The next available appointment wasn\u2019t until February. After I had the pre-construction meeting with the construction manager, I received and signed the meeting notes that had the \u201cpricing\u201d based on the selections made. I received an email over a week later notifying me that because I had to reschedule the pre-construction meeting my construction date had to be pushed out and the price of the house increased by over $30,000! So now I am back at square one looking for my next home.  This just may be my blessing in disguise. If a company doesn\u2019t see you for more than a dollar, then maybe they don\u2019t deserve my money.  I\u2019m truly shocked and disappointed by the lack of empathy shown given the situation. I\u2019ll never recommend anyone to this builder just based on this experience alone. I\u2019ve heard of nightmare stories, but I never imagined this would really happen. I get that companies are in the business to make a profit, but I do not believe that in less than a month the price we agreed to per our signed contract should have increased by over $30,000. I understand that there is an influx in this market however you don\u2019t tell me a week after sending me documents to sign (which I did) that my contract is null and void due to market demands. It\u2019s really devastating that a company that has built its reputation on people and prides itself on the best interest of the customer would do just the opposite. They violated our trust and have shown that they have no integrity.

It was nice having a decent number of choices and Charlie/Cindy helped a bunch answering questions and suggestions.\n\nAs a whole, we still love our house and the neighborhood. It's a great location, nice neighbors, quiet, and will be a great place to raise our family.\n\nOn the house itself, during and after build, quite a bit of poor quality work kept being attempted to be passed off as normal.\n\nLimited quality control appeared to be performed. There were obvious issues that they just ignored; mostly cosmetic but some big ones too with outlets (see below).\n\nIt was known this was our first home purchase and I really feel they tried to take advantage of that. Instead of doing things right, they appeared to cut some corners and I guess hope we wouldn't notice or know any better.\n\nIt is disappointing when, based on reviews, it seemed like it'd be a stress free and streamlined process from a local company.\n\nSome of the good stuff:\n- Working with Cindy on selections was great. She really helped get things in order. Same with the Richards lighting folks who were great as well.\n\n- We really like the flooring (Cindy really helped out with us picking them!). Wolde did a good job making it look good.\n\n- Overall we love the kitchen. They did an extended counter/cabinets and moved pantry shelves to the large side closet instead. Got plenty of counter space with lots of storage - exactly what we wanted.\n\nExample of issues:\n\n- Improper outlet installations. Backstab connections on most, box recessed too far and mounted incorrectly (exposed drywall screws through box into stud), and drywall screws to attach outlet to boxes.\n\n- Bad outlet cutouts. Large chunks of drywall missing and tried to hide it with plate covers. Some of the holes were even outside the plates.\n\n- Ceiling drywall seams are very noticeable with bumps, tape edge, etc visible. For open plan and this lighting, a higher level drywall finish was needed.\n\n- Venthood was originally installed with no seal to the attic, just left open. They did come and spray foam up in it to seal it but should have been addressed by MH checks.\n\n- Stove is different model than what we ordered. Nobody called to let us know original not available anymore - it was a slide in, this one is free standing. Had I known I would have changed to a cooktop (prefer stoves with overhanging tops which this one is not).\n\nEdit:\nDropping to 1 star due to behavior of sub-contractors. Electrician walked in arguing, wouldn't listen to any concerns, everything was fine even if another electrician said it wasn't - and I have their report.\n\nIf you feel someone is wrong, discuss it and show why.

We had never built a home so we really didn't know what to expect but are very satisfied with our home. Once you pick out your floor plan and lot that you are going to build on you get to meet with Cindy who is the design coordinator. This is really fun and one thing that separates Murphy Homes from most builders. With Cindy's help you get to design your home from many different options, so you can customize your home the way you want and Cindy is very helpful and fun to work with. The build took about 6 months and was relatively easy, and any issues were resolved by the owner Charlie and the realtor Stephen.

She walked us through the upgrades and floor plans and we were surprised at everything that was included. At other builder's, they upgrades were a standard and included at Stone Martin! We signed a contract a week later and watched every phase our new home went through while being built. Five months later and now we have moved into our beautiful home. Stone Martin worked with us when we had an issue with our closing date. They were so gracious in allowing us to push the date out!

The project involved demo of some existing kitchen cabinets, replacement of a cook top and stove with a range, replacement of a vent hood, installing new kitchen lighting, laying tile, painting cabinets and bookshelves, painting trim, and painting walls.  All of this was handled by David's crew without having to sub out any work. The quality of the work done was really top-tier.  We used David's decorating consultant, Lindy, to help pick out colors, and the result has significantly brightened and beautified the two rooms where we spend most of our waking hours.\n\nWhen you undertake a project that takes this much time, you quickly realize that you have invited some strangers into your home for a lengthy stay.   Well, the guys David sent did not stay strangers for very long.  They were cheerful, friendly, and helpful to us.  They added, without cost, some features to the project at our request, even though these features were not in the original contract-- for example, installing a dimmer switch in the kitchen, replacing flood lights in our dinette area so they would match the color put out by our new kitchen lighting, cutting out the trim along one wall of our living room so our bookcase could lay flat against the wall, and installing wall outlets in our bookcase.  They cleaned up after themselves every day and hauled away their own trash.  When they moved furniture around to do some painting, they always put it back where it had been.  It got to where we enjoyed having the company at our house.  At the end of the job, we were glad it was completed, but we were sorry to see the guys leave.\n\nAll the work was done with great attention to detail.  They found and installed tile to match our existing kitchen backsplash tile.  They worked on our project every weekday for three weeks.  On some days, they worked on our cabinet doors and bookcase at their shop, but on the days when they did not come, David always called us to let us know they would not be there and what they would be doing that day.\n\nWe will certainly call on Lisenby Construction if we undertake new remodeling projects.

The cabinets are barley glued together and keep coming apart as well as numerous places in our walls and ceiling have started to crack. However, our biggest issue is that our home which is less than two years old has multiple roof leaks, I have attempted to get them looked at and repaired for almost a month now. The general manager came out and said that they would get a roofer out to look at them, I have emailed numerous times with no responses, I have called and was told it would be handled and nothing is done then I was told the roofer would be at home and they never showed. I have now emailed 5 times and called 5 times with no resolution in sight.

My first home they did a great job and I couldn't have been happier.  With that being said, the second time around using them as a builder has been a HORRIBLE experience and I will NEVER consider buying another home from them.  Both homes that I purchased from them were brand new and built from the ground up.  I have had issues from the first day I stepped foot into my home that were not easily seen during the walk thru.  Multiple issues from the truss to the flooring/foundation(water coming up through the flooring/tiles) to a water damaged door.  I closed on my home in January of 2016 and we are now in July of 2017 and I still have issues that haven't been resolved and are on going.  One of which I believe is a serious issue but they are trying to quick fix it so I will move on.  I've had water/moisture come up through my flooring and it's an issue that they said they've never seen before(lucky me).  They seem to be passing the ball from one person to the next.  It took months to have a simple interior door replaced and I'm still waiting to have the door painted months later!  I've called numerous times and was told that someone would contact me only to have no one contact me.  Emails that have not been responded to and once I finally get someone on the phone, I'm told that my email was received and she had been meaning to call me.  Weeks have gone by at a time with no contact from Adam's and if you call their corporate office, they simply say that all warranty issues are handled in the field and not by corporate.  I still have exposed flooring that guest have to step over and it's ridiculous!!  I've NEVER done a review of any company in a negative manner and I could go on for days but I just wanted to save another potential Adam's Home customer the heartache!  It's tiring and stressful trying to run down a company to fix issues that are a result of their workmanship, especially when you work full time and have a family to take care of!  This is not what you envision when you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a product!! Your experience maybe different but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone!!  My next home will be a Truland or a complete custom builder!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a120b6e0fcd95:0xcea877bd307a5ffd"}

He provided me with two estimates, one for what we had (3 tab laminate) and one for the HD 3d roofing. There was not a large price difference between the two, which is normally marked up with other roofers. He also presented his business license and insurance up front without me having to ask. He was extremely easy to get in contact with and answered any time I called, by name. He made this an amazing experience where I never had to wonder what would happen next. He came in $3000 less than the other two estimates we received. There was never any pressure for us to go with this company and we have a better warranty than other roofers for labor and materials. The price was exactly as quoted with no hidden fees. Everything happened as he said it would. Seamless process for an otherwise hectic problem of having to have a roof replaced. I would recommend him to absolutely anyone. Several neighbors have had new roofs put on and ours is by far the best in the neighborhood. There aren't enough words for the appreciation I have for him.

A review is simply that, my opinion based on my experiences. You, however sir, have turned this into something else and are taking a path that I choose not to follow. It is not that I did not want to \u201cdo the work\u201d. I do not have to list my credentials to prove something to someone who in the grand scheme of things does not matter. I have 10 millions things going on in my life. From speaking with other people who had roof repairs, I was informed that the repair company does that part. So I based my expectations off of what many people, including people in your profession, explained to me about the process. In MY OPINION, which is what this is, I felt it could have been handled better. As stated before, you seemed disinterested from the beginning of the conversation but I chose to continue on because of the amazing reviews you received. At the end of the day, I am above this. For the record, I have contacted a company who will come out and assess the damages and give me a quote that I plan to pay for myself if that is what it comes to. Lastly, I have adjusted the ranking because clearly \u201cstars\u201d are more important that people. I am in no way here to damage anyone\u2019s reputation.

I called and left a message with a representative who said I\u2019d receive a call back. True enough, I did; however, everything seemed rushed and the gentleman seemed disinterested from the beginning. I explained that I had some leakages that an inspector felt could have resulted from hail damage and that I was interested in getting an evaluation. I feel as if the man I spoke to felt that I had no point of reference just by some of his questions and comments. After telling him that I had another company come out weeks prior who did an inspection and said I had a valid claim, the man I was speaking with all of a sudden seemed interested in what I had to say. Further conversation revealed that my policy was transferred to a new company and that there may not be a storm that I could link the damages to under my new policy, which is understandable. From that point on, all conversation had a negative undertone and seemed as if it was a race to end the call. My biggest disappointment came in when he recommended that I personally look for a storm with a date that correlates to the damages and call him back if I find one. He said he\u2019d do the same. Needless to say, that was 3+ weeks ago. I do not feel that it is my responsibility to find a storm. The other company did all of that for me. I did not go with them due to poor communication and failure to call back in a timely fashion (like more than a week passed when I was supposed to receive a return call within 24 hrs).

I do appreciate that she acknowledged that we promptly returned her call, which we always try very hard to do, but beyond the truth in that, her complaint against us is totally unwarranted.\nThis person wants to file a claim against her insurance company for hail damage to her roof. She told me that she changed insurance companies at the end of last year. I explained to her that in order to start the claims process her present insurance company will want to know the date of the hail storm that damaged her roof, in order for them to confirm (or deny) coverage. I told her that I am unaware of any hail storms that occurred so far this year that would help her to start a legitimate claim against her present company. I told her that I could be mistaken, and encouraged her to do some research and maybe she will learn of a storm that I am not aware of. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is an excellent governmental reference point for weather history.\nThe issue is not whether she has hail damage on her roof, but rather whether she can make a claim for the damage against her present insurance company, so it will pay for it. It appears that she can't.\nHer complaint against us is clearly rooted in her notion that she didn't want to be bothered to have to put any effort into the fact-gathering element of making a claim with her insurance company. She didn't want to \"\u2026 personally look for a storm with a date that correlates to the damages and call him back\". This is her \"biggest disappointment\". She obviously feels that someone else should do everything for her.

Referrals by mouth are rare and I did not have anyone I knew who had replaced their roof recently. Searching the websites was my only option. I decided to call roofers nearby or within my Zip Code.  Alabama Discount Roofing and three others were on the BBB website. I read the reviews and settled on three.  I called Alabama Discount Roofing and Marc was very nice to agree to meet with me on Sunday to accommodate my schedule. When Marc came, he was professional, respectful and did not put pressure on me to make a decision. I had prepared a list of questions to ask him but I only asked a few questions because he was very well prepared; he brought all his paper work for the licenses and insurances.  He also had prepared three different estimates: one for the 3 tab Asphalt Shingles, Architectural Shingles and the Metal roofing which he left with me and also samples of the shingles.  This gave me an idea what is available and what it will cost me. In addition, he brought with him a reference list with 17 names to contact if I had more questions. I told him that I had two other companies I wanted to meet with and then will call him back once I get their quotes. One company left their estimate on the door and I was not able to talk to them in personal but communicated by phone. The other company came in and we met but did not have all the details of paper work as Marc had prepared for me. I relied on what they told me. One had a lower price but did not tell what shingles they were going to use. Alabama Discount Roofing also gave me a five year labor and workmanship Leak Free Warranty while the other two gave me a two year Warranty. I made a choice to go with Alabama Discount Roofing and the Architectural shingles. The materials were delivered a day before and the next day, on 11/09/ 2016 before 7:00 am, the workers arrived. They were organized, worked fast and each one seemed to know what he was doing on the site. I had a few question and they answered my questions or I called Marc and he explained.  Since I was at work, Marc made sure he sent photos of the progress and at the end he sent me more pictures of the completed job. Marc did not ask me to pay up front and this made me more comfortable. The cleaning was amazing. I have not found any nails or debris left behind. It seems like they were never here. At the end of day, I met with Marc and he made sure I had no further questions or concerns. Would I recommend this company to any one? Absolutely yes, this is a professional company with a personal touch. Excellent customer service and my estimates and the actual cost were not far apart.\nVL", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890f1c0c45fdd7:0xe897e4d03dcb5ebe"}

First and foremost, homes are built 100% by people and as such are susceptible to human error. The homes here in the dairy are not by any stretch of the imagination to be considered top quality homes. They are also not the worst in the industry, but do expect to have some trouble in years 0-3. Final product looks good, especially from the curb. Attention to detail lacks which comes with  territory when homes are built as fast as these are but they are priced competitively. One of the biggest issues I have observed (biggest impact by time, cost and inconvenience) is the quality of the drywall work. In particular the ceiling seams. You will begin to see bulging and cracking between 6months to 2 years (the model home and several neighbors had cracks after 6-8 months). In 20 years of remodeling in climates from as far south as Florida to Northern Virginia, only times drywall seams crack is when improper drying, support, taping, and or mudding was done.\nAdditionally, dealing with the 1 year warranty work has been challenging to say the least which is another common issue (complaint shared by multiple neighbors). If this review were solely based on that experience, it would be 1 star or less but that would not be fair to the builder.\nThe question of course is would I do it again knowing what I now know. The answer to that is yes, but with 60% confidence provided there was a way to mitigate drywall and warranty issues to name a few.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88620dd59450f9bf:0x5010038752c67a35"}

I've have tried calling their sales office, I was told to call corporate, I called corporate and got voicemail.\n\nMy house is about 4 years old.  Well out of warranty.  But, most of the poor workmanship appears after the warranty period has ended.  My master bath and entrance to our master bedroom has severe structural problems.  The cracks you see have been re-plastered and painted more than once.  Forget about doors closing properly.  The doors have been trimmed to such an extent that a new door will be required for the bedroom.  The framing issues you may have will not be covered by your warranty and will not appear until a few years after you own your home.  Once they do, you will find yourself spending a lot of money to repair.\n\nIf framing were the only issue, I probably would not write the review.  I never do this kind of thing.  But the electrical was done so poorly that it nearly burned the house down.  The left exposes copper to aluminum high voltage line exposed in a junction box.  The result was blowing out the double oven's control panel.  This resulted in an expensive repair to the ovens, but could have easily resulted in a fire.   Again-- the kind of thing that happens well after your warranty period has expired.\n\nThe problem I have with Woodland, is that their \"quality\" is only skin deep.  They have a great marketing staff, but once your in your house and a year has passed you are on your own to deal with the poor workmanship that lies just below the surface.  No builder is perfect.

If you don\u2019t listen to anything else, just hear me when I say do NOT let them close on your house until they finish everything. It has truly been bad enough that I regret ever choosing them as a builder, no matter how much we do like the house itself.\n\nAnd again, if I\u2019m being completely honest, the staff that they have are nice people. I mean I have legitimately enjoyed dealing with most of their staff, but I\u2019ve also had to do their job for them. I have to do all of the follow-up to make sure people are showing up to do their warranty repairs. I\u2019ve had to coordinate with the warranty department and the subs to make sure they had all of the correction items listed.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting dealing with Woodland and their lack of support for Warranty customers. I\u2019ve told them this multiple times, but if they would put just as much care into how they treat and deal with Warranty customers as they do with new customers still in the building process, they would be a nearly flawless business. Until then, they deserve this negative review and more. I\u2019ve spoken with multiple people in my neighborhood who can corroborate this story and would say the same thing themselves. We have warned people we know away from Woodland specifically because of this and away from some of the specific sub contractors they use. Horrible customer service, dismal professionalism, and a demeanor that says \u201cyou as a customer don\u2019t matter to us as much as the new build customers.\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617991364735, "text": "Blake,\n\nThank you for the kind words regarding your home building experience with Woodland Homes. We are happy to hear that you had a fun experience and enjoyed our process of building. Next, we would like to say that we understand your frustrations with warranty. We are in fact struggling with time lines and subcontractors. At this time North Alabama and surrounding areas are experiencing a housing boom. This combined with the struggles of building a product in the midst\u2019s of a global pandemic have made it difficult to obtain products for some of our customers warranty requests.\n\nIt is also difficult to keep subs motivated when they have so much work to choose from in front of them. This is just the honest truth, and the reality of the world we are living in.  That said we understand it is frustrating to wait on your items to be completed. While it may take us a little longer to complete a warranty item we are getting to all of our customers and completing their warranty requests. In fact, we have even extended specific warrantable items past the agreed upon 1 year term in order to ensure our customers are happy, and have their items completed .\n\nSince we don\u2019t know your full name there is no way to reach out directly. We would encourage you to call your onsite sales person and get them involved to assist you, or even call our corporate office and ask for the president of the company.

The personnel in the home office were welcoming and professional. During the build I hired a home inspector who found major errors with the home.

Upon walking through my home I found basic issues with the craftsmanship that should\u2019ve been addressed by the site manager, if he had completed a walk thru of the home. Once the home was complete a final walk thru was scheduled. I found the same issues as the last walk thru. At this point, if you don\u2019t address the problem it\u2019s often overlooked. I refused to sign for the keys. As a buyer I felt rushed to sign for the keys to the home, that wasn\u2019t ready. I was promised the issues would be addressed in a timely manner, \u201cI\u2019M STILL WAITING\u201d. I still have a page of outstanding issues with my home. As a premier builder I expected more. The subcontractors provided poor quality of work. No disrespect, but the attention to detail lacked, for my home. I hope no one has to go through what I did. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s due to the number of homes Woodland is trying to build or is this the standard issue with Woodland across the board. I didn\u2019t want to come off as a complainer, so I asked around my neighborhood and many of us shared the same problems. This is not to bash Woodland. The homes, cosmetically looks great, I think more effort needs to be made to build a better quality home for the price and oversight of the subcontractors is a must. If this doesn\u2019t happen hold the site manager accountable. The warranty department shouldn\u2019t make people feel like they are the problem. The subcontractors need to do their job and provide a quality product.

It actually defies logic that I could desire so much to live there, be impressed with what I saw, and have the experiences I have had. Maybe it is coincidence but I don\u2019t think so. I will simply state what happened and let the reader decide. I have seriously looked at Woodland homes 4 times. The first experience was positive but I was afraid of the road in and out of the area so I decided not to buy. The last 3 times I had resolved that fear and wanted to purchase a house from Woodland homes. The first of these three, I spoke with an associate. He showed me a lot and gave me a price for a home on the lot. He said we had to see his boss. I did so and she literally panicked. She said he gave me the wrong price. I said ok and left. The second of these 3 times, Woodland homes sent me an email with an advertisement for a house already built. It was priced in the range we were looking for. We made an appointment with the aforementioned realtor and spent 30 minutes looking at the home. It had one feature we did not like but we were about to make an offer when she said oh no, this house has been sold. She added, but we can build you one like it on another lot. We spent a couple of hours looking at lots and found 3 we liked. She said she would send us the prices on all three. The result was that the lot we wanted was not available for the house we wanted to build on it and the other two had prices that were 40 to 50 thousand dollars more than the one we looked at. Not exactly the same price...The last time my wife met with a different realtor and got prices for several models one of which was built and the other almost completed. You have probably guessed what happened. I showed up with the checkbook only to find that all of the homes with quoted prices were much higher than documented on the plans provided to my wife. The one we really wanted was about $70,000 more. The other home already built was about 40,000 dollars more than documented on the plans.We left and will not return. The neighborhood looks great and maybe our experience is some kind of odd anomaly. Just wanted to share it.

However, if you are looking for top quality and attention to detail, you would be better off with another builder. They build homes quickly - maybe too quickly as evidenced by some of the problems we have experienced.  After living in our home for two years, a light switch in our dining room which was not in use at the time suddenly sparked and popped and caused a breaker to blow.  I called an electrician who discovered that the wiring was barely connected which caused arcing and sparking.  He then checked a few more light switches and outlets to find that about half of them were loose and sloppily constructed.  I ended up paying for the electrician to inspect every light switch and electrical plug in my home. I have also had to replace wiring in the electrical box because of a humming noise.\nWhen you build a home with Woodland, they schedule you for a one day marathon of dealing with the contract staff and their design team.  You must be prepared to make ALL decisions in one day.  Their design center has a limited number of choices and you have no time to research products. Don't assume that they offer quality products, either.  Price Pfister products were their plumbing choice at the time I built my home. Huge mistake.  If I had known how crappy this brand was, I would have insisted on Delta products. That goes for wood floors also.  I chose a \"premium\" product for an additional cost only to find after it started denting and scratching immediately that it was made out of a soft eucalyptus based engineered wood.  I have already replaced half of it with a nice Hickory engineered wood that has held up beautifully- even in high traffic.\nI was not happy with either their ceramic tile selection or carpet choices but had no option other than to pick what I disliked the least.  Apparently, most of my neighbors did the same because we all have the same back splash.  I have already replaced carpeting in my bedroom because of poor wear.\nThis is not the first home that I have had built so it is not like I was expecting perfection.

I was in the process of buying one of their new homes at 7104 Ridgecrest in the Little Mountain development in Owens Cross Roads. All of my opinions are based on this one home, the only Stoneridge home i have been, or ever will be involved with.\nThe one thing Stoneridge does do good is build a pretty home, interior trim work is beautiful. But in MY OPINION the problems lie beneath.\nTheir treatment of me as a possible customer is deplorable, that is my opinion. Their customer service towards me was to try to intimidate me with their money and lawyers, instead of even corresponding in a civil manner. When i refused to comply with their wish to keep my earnest money they responded with threats and intimidation.\nInstead of providing answers to the questions about the problems with this home in writing, as the contract said and i requested, they delayed the response beyond the 10 Day inspection clause. There were verbals \"Don't worry its a new home and we will take care of it\" but nothing in writing as i requested. So i would suggest you get everything in writing from all builders, including Stoneridge.\nSo i posted a bad review on their facebook page, and they removed reviews from their facebook page. So i posted this review and the owners of the company Jim Wright and his Wife called me at home and threatened to \"Bury me under a mountain of lawyers\" if i did not remove this review. Well now i have a letter from their lawyers threatening to sue me if i do not remove all written libelous remark, etc. etc.\n\nOn to the problem:\nI had the home inspected and several issues were found. The Master bedroom had a \"Soft Spot\" in the floor. There were \"settling cracks\" in the wall board in the entrance to the house. And numerous settling cracks in the entrance porch slab floor, the driveway and the back patio.\nIn the crawl space there were many pieces of insulation that had fallen from the space in the floor joists. There own construction manager told me the insulation contractor must have forgot the wires used to hold the insulation up. There were missing grates in the ventilation holes in the crawl spaces. On one of the piers the floor joist was not resting on it as it should, probably causing the soft spot. Another pier was damaged.\n\nThe big one was the inspector stated \"Client is advised to ask the builder if proper footing was built\". This was due to the excessive mortar cracking on the rear porch. So i asked, and the question was not ever answered by Stoneridge. However on November 8 a structural engineer (Hired by Stoneridge) inspected the house and suggested \"Underpinning\" the porch to prohibit further settling. In the dictionary \"underpinning\" is defined as a fix for a faulty foundation. So there you go, someone else has stated the foundation is faulty or not adequate.\nUnfortunately for me the inspection happened to be after the 10 day inspection period, so i had to accept he proposed fix or forfeit my earnest money. How convenient for Stoneridge.\nIn my opinion i do not want to purchase a brand new, never lived in house that even needs an inspection by a structural engineer to deem whether or not the foundation is adequate. Much less a house that needs underpinning before it is ever lived in.\nThey did say they would let me out of the contract if they could keep the money and i could use it for the purchase of another Stoneridge home. But who would possibly want to work with people who use threats as a negotiating technique.\nAll people reading this should look up the definition of Underpinning, and decide for yourself if you should purchase a home from this company. As well look at the 4 complaints to the BBB and see how they respond to defective workmanship complaints.\n\nOf course all of this is my opinion", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626986f27f68b7:0xc848816fb396fdef"}
