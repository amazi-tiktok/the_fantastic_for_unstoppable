It was a good enough experience even with my arm in a cast. I left happy and the only reason I disconnected our cable and internet was because we don't really watch TV much anymore.  Our internet was iffy at best. You could work on your phone but if you moved or turned over it had to think about it too often and long. I got a move- in special for 1 year.

The manager told her there was nothing they could do.  She was told that she could purchase another phone.  Fast forward, my mother called me, I googled the words in Spanish to get her into the the languages so that she could select English as her primary language.  This is an example of poor quality customer service.  If it were not for me, she would have been out of more money for no reason.

I had originally purchased a phone from the Florence location for my daughter and it started having issues on day one.  We took it back to that location 2 times and of course they did their diagnostic tests on it, reset it twice and then sent us on our way.  Apparently i got a \"bad APPLE\" because none of this fixed the problems.  Fed up with this location, I decided to visit the Muscle Shoals location.  Let's just say that this will be my \"go to\" store going forward.  I was greeted by Nicole and she was absolutely amazing.  She presented the issues we were having to her manager \"Trinidad\" I think was his name and he agreed that the phone was bad.  They didn't have that exact color of phone in stock so she asked if I would be willing to drive to the Decatur store to get one.  I said yes so then she proceeded to call that location and told them everything.  She set everything up with a rep at that store and we swapped the phone out.

I really needed to get my phone issue taken care of though. During the process of trying to get my phone active and getting my plan started we ran into several obstacles that required multiple calls to other departments inside of AT&T. Not once did I sense any frustration or irritability because these calls where having to be made and by this time it was past seven. Actually I was the one being told thank you for my patience even though these guys were staying past closing. Christine and Greg gladly stayed until 8pm making sure but I was taken care of. This may be hands-down the best customer service I\u2019ve ever received. Anyone who\u2019s fortunate enough to have Christine or Greg help them when they go in to the Auburn AT&T store I promise you\u2019ll be just as pleased!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596032054253, "text": "Hey Ryan,\nThank you so much!

His diligent slogging through 9 phone support personnel from 5 different departments, including 4 different people from \"Porting Activations\" (which is apparently based somewhere in Russia...) made us both laugh, and nearly cry, and turned what would have been a soul crushing experience into something I will look back on mostly fondly.\n\nI cannot recommend T-Mobile highly enough after all this, but if you choose AT&T (or if you're contractually glued to them), do yourself a HUGE favor and go see Jermaine at this location if you need any changes made that involve changes to your account itself.\n\n(Note: the other 3 CSRs there all seem very nice too, but I dealt with Jermaine and this is mostly a review of his performance, which was excellent.  Don't let this discourage you from trying one of the others, though.)\n\nP.S. I've noticed some other reviewers say you should try the Tigertown store.  I've been there twice, including earlier in the day yesterday, and they were zero help.

I've been a wireless customer of AT&T for 12 years and when this place popped up near my work, I decided to use it to replace my upgefukked LG G3.\nBig mistake. I cracked the screen, first time ever, and went back to this location and was told, basically I was out of luck. I didn't take the insurance. What insurance? It was never mentioned nor offered.\nOK. My bad. I went to 3 different repair centers, non-AT&T, and was quoted ~$100 at each place. After a lengthy wait at each place (7-10 days) I was told the screen on this LG G35 ThinQ was different in camera location from any screens they could get.\nHmmmm...\nI went to \"first-in-town\" AT&T store and was told, and I quote: \"...oh. Those stores aren't really AT&T stores. They are \"Authorized Re-sellers, only. You should have come here. We don't even sell the G35.\"\nI returned, once again, to the re-seller and we had a Come to Jesus Meeting. I'm big and was pretty TO'ed. They agreed to get it repaired, at my cost, by sending it to LG in Ft. Worth TX. They did fix it. $152.\n\nIn short: do NOT use these \"re-seller\" stores. They are akin to \"Big Lots\".

Last night, Wednesday, 5/01/2018, my internet was virtually nonexistent. I woke up this morning and called Xcelerate Networks right at 8am. This is one of the reasons why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I was on hold for approximately 20-30 minutes before someone finally answered. I explained to the lady, I didn't catch her name, my issues and she stated that it would be escalated to a next-level technician and told me that is all that she could do. At first, I was a little weary because of the negative reviews that I've read here. Thirty minutes later, to my amazement, I received a phone call from Candace. She asked a few more questions and then let me know there would be a technician out today to check out my issues. At this point, I was thoroughly surprised. The technician showed up maybe 30 minutes after that and resolved the issue within an hour.\n\nSo....for the 2nd reason I'm giving only 4 stars, having one technician available for this apartment complex on Thursdays only? That's a little ridiculous. 10 years ago, that might have been okay but many people, myself included, rely on the internet to make a living. If my internet goes down on a Friday then I don't make any money for an entire week and have a potential for customer loss. The last reason for 4 stars....the speeds, 30Mbps max down, really!?

He advised he had work orders, in another city, that afternoon and could not complete the install that evening.  The apartment office was close, that day, and the install never happened.  Money, for an install and equipment, was also taken out of my account and the job has not been started or completed.!!  8) A rep from Xcelerate, called me, to discuss rescheduling. She advised that their install time is usually 8am-5pm and they hardly ever install outside of that time (Poor Customer Service). 9) I asked the rep could installs be completed, in my town, in the afternoon? She advised they could. The rep asked when I would be available and I explained to her I would be available the following Tuesday (which happens to be today) at 1. She advised the technician would call me at 12:00 or 12:30 to ensure I would be at home at 1. 10)This morning I called Xcelerate to ensure my install time was still 1pm, and I was told that it was. I left work for lunch, to have my wifi/cable installed. Guess what didn't occur,?!?! The install!  It's 3:14 and the install did not happen and I have not been contacted by the company.  I had to call Xcelerate to ask what happened?!?  I was told they could not make contact with the dispatcher (install technician) and they would have to call me back.

We had difficulties and getting anyone to do anything about it was near impossible. Customer service was rude as was one of the Techs sent to the house.

Went to the store only to find out boxes would not be in ghe store until the 22nd.\nCalled customer service, no problem, we\u2019ll send one out. Box arrived, no instructions nor remote. Hooked it up with assistance of customer service, had picture for 5 minutes then went black screen. She made a same day apt for me.\nTech arrived, gave us a remote, worked awhile and got one channel working. Said it could take a day for everything to come up. Ten minutes after he left it went black screen. Several calls later got another apt. 8:30 at night I called because it was 2 hours passed the apt time. Told it was still opend. Told him to show in the morning. They called me at 9:23 pm when I was sleeping and since I didn\u2019t answer the phone they cancelled work order.\nMade another apt and it was cancelled for some reason.\nGot connected with a supervisor in SC who got me a 5 pm apt. Tech showed up 10 to 5, said it probably needed rebooted, thst had been done numerous times. I told him he was supposed to bring a new box.\nDidn\u2019t have any, off to the store 10 minutes away to get one. After an hour I called and cancelled my service.\nI\u2019ve been thru way too much in my life to be treated like this.\nBottom line-\n-Customer Service is there to make you feel good. They can\u2019t do squat\n-Supervises are there to tell you stuff to appease you and get you off there back, basicly lie to you.\n-The techs that came in my home had no purpose being here.\nAs for me and my family, we choose books.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d385b97c0906d:0xd92d2cc80054e9db"}

They are not very knowledgeable about issues that you are having with your phone.  I have two contacts in my phone that call and get sent straight to VM.  It doesn\u2019t show a missed call either.  I ran through 1.5 hours with apple on a chat.  Checked online after they couldn\u2019t fix it and found that the only thing that i had not tried is a new SIM card. I figured what could it hurt i have tried everything else.  He changed my SIM card and gave my phone back to me after checking the usual and asking the same questions that i had already told him that apple support sent me through. He even suggested that if the callers that went straight to VM had my number blocked.  I can call them but they cannot call me.  This doesn\u2019t make any sense.  After a couple of minutes with the new SIM card my service had not activated yet.  I mentioned it to him. He checked the phone line and said that it is a good on his end that it could take up to six hours and if it still did not have service to call att and they would take care of the issue over the phone.  Just one question i have is why are they even there if they have no idea how these things work and if they have to have me call att just to activate my card.

I paid my $100 deposit in cash and was told my installation date. The day came for installation and no one showed. I reached out to the employee Scott who created my order and he said because of the rain there were delays. I ended up getting an approx. date for installation from Bishop which was on a Sunday(which At&t is closed...so how was that). Of course, no one showed. So I called At&t directly and inquired about it and was told they saw the account created but they saw nothing about my payment or info of an installation date for me. I made another $100 deposit with my debit card directly with At&t & I was advised to go back to the store to obtain a full refund of the cash payment. I've gotten the biggest run around at this store. They tell me I'm going to get my money back and they'd call me but NO ONE EVER CALLS ME WITH ANYTHING! I've constantly had to go out to this store just to see what the status was and they always tell me they are working on it and would call! NEVER HAPPENED! I finally spoke to the manager Sam and he supposedly filled out the necessary paperwork on the computer so I could get my refund sent via check in the mail within six weeks. ITS BEEN 5 MONTHS!! NO CHECK!! Went out there yet again and Scott informs me that Sam's no longer with them and they now have a temp manager and he wasn't going to address him with the issue because he wasn't going to be there long. Scott said the district manager was coming to the store a little later that evening to drop off a customer's phone. He assured he get my concern to the district manager once he arrived at the store and he would call me also once he arrived so I could speak to him. NEVER HAPPENED! I popped up on a different day and spoke to the temp manager and he agreed that it shouldn't have been this complicated and he'd look into it. Come to find out the employee Scott made an error by taking cash instead of a credit/debit card. He rung it up as if I was making a cell deposit which allowed the acceptance of cash because if he rung it up as internet it wouldn't have allowed him to accept cash instead it would've prompted for credit/debit card. The temp manager said he emailed two different people on the cell phone side to see how he can go about obtaining my refund and he said he'd call me. Things felt promising because it seemed he was being genuine! He said he'd called once he heard something(which would take a few days). I've given it almost two weeks and no call no nothing! I called a day ago to speak with the temp manager and Bishop told me he was with a customer. Bishop asked for my name, contact number, and reason for wanting to speak to him. Bishop said he'd have him call and I thought he would since he was in the store. I WAS WRONG! IM STILL YET TO GET ANYWHERE WITH THIS MATTER AND MY PATIENCE IS VERY THIN AT THIS POINT! IM SICK AND TIRED OF THE RUN AROUND! I JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN PUT THIS MATTER BEHIND ME! I'VE BEEN MORE THAN PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING!!! I know they have other things on their to do list but I feel that my situation should be some form of a priority given that the mistake was on the employee. It shouldn't take over 5 months for this situation to be resolved but when the workers aren't trying to do nothing about it....nothing will get done! Every time I've went out there everyone is just standing around doing the usual. I feel nobody is taking it seriously nor are they putting in a conscious effort to ensure I get my refund!! They never have to be concerned about me coming back to this store after I obtain my money!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888959ea2b2360c1:0x62f4a6886acdd72a"}

However, I received a phone call a couple days before hand (they left a voicemail) that I would not be receiving internet services.\n\nI called at 11:44am and was placed on hold for quite some time and could not stay on the phone for any longer as my lunch break was over.\nI called again at 4:14pm. This call lasted 11 minutes. I was told that I could not get high speed but that I could get 12mb.\n\nSeptember 15th\nI called Frontier again and I was told I could only get 6mb, then the statement was retracted, and I was told that I could not get any internet service at my location. I questioned this as I had been previously told that I could get 6mb, then I was told once again that I actually could get 6mb. So then I scheduled an appointment for 10/6/2020 to have the internet installed.\n\nOctober 6th\nFrontier was scheduled to come between 1pm-5pm. I had to work, so I had a friend come over to my house on their day off so someone could be there. Frontier came at 9:30am and left a note on the door that they needed to bury a drop box. I called frontier at 11:31am wondering why someone had arrived so early. I was on the phone until 11:47am during my lunch at work trying to get this figured out, but did not receive any answers. I was not very happy, as I assumed I would be receiving internet services this day. I would think that Frontier would know if I had a drop box at my house already? Frontier left me a voicemail that someone would be coming to run the lines for my internet on October 20th, and I would get internet installed on October 26th.\n\nOctober 26th\nI received a text reminder on October 25th to remind me of my upcoming appointment with Frontier. I also received another text message reminder on October 26th that Frontier would be coming to my house between 1pm-5pm. Once again, I had someone at my house as I usually work during these hours. Frontier never came... I called Frontier at 4:57pm wondering what was going on. Once again, I didn't really receive an answer. I was told that the department that I needed to talk to was already gone for the day and that they would give me a call the next day.\n\nOctober 27th\nI called Frontier again.. and explained that I have never had so many problems with a company before. I explained that I have been trying to get internet from them for almost 2 months now.. and I have had nothing but problems. They told me that a subcontractor needs to come out and run the lines before they can install internet... they also explained that they should be contacting me soon.. which I obviously didn't believe at this point. I told them I was very dissatisfied and that I would be going with a different internet company at this point.\n\nOctober 30th\nI went with a different company and have internet and am currently using it with no problems :)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889079b02d467b29:0xe53f14dd904bac61"}

I have had so many service calls for lack of speed(supposed to be \"up to\" 6mbps but had maybe 1) and frequent internet drops or disconnects. First, I want to say, the technicians hands are tied as far what they can do. they are doing the best they can to put band aids on these old lines and keep them running. But still to this day, I have quite a few internet disconnects a day. I have just given up on them ever fixing the problem and should mention that this happens every year sometimes more than once were my internet will just stop working and they fix it And then it works fine for a few weeks then it goes back to frequent disconnects and so on. the technicians have measured as many as 400 disconnects in a 24 hr period. If they would just upgrade these lines and may run some fiber optic to some of the main hubs then these problems would stop. I wish I could say I'm the only one with these problem.s but my neighbors all say the same thing. I was told these lines were originally only run to be used for phone. But my parents live next door and they always  have issues with both internet and phone. they have lots of really loud staic in the lines and sometime buzzing so loud you can't hear anything and often times the phone just doesn't work. so even if these lines in our area were supposed to be used primarily for landline phones, obviously they aren't sufficient for that either. so why not replace them with new lines and have satisfied customers instead of reviews and complaints like this? because they don't care about those of us who are getting terrible service. they have no competition here to worry about so they know they can ignore us and continue to collect our money. the moment another company moves in, a lot of us in this area will be switching.

I thought Janet was the manager at the Corporate store because she has such a welcoming and caring work attitude. The woman manager never looked up, never said a word to me or anyone else that I noticed on my first visit to the store.

He fixed what needed fixing right away.\n\nI recommend Justin and Janet as your \"go to person\".  In Oct I plan to upgrade cell phone because this one is no longer made or sold.

So, about 21 years now. Anyway...\n\nOn Tuesday, 11/02/2020 (Election Day) my iphone went out due to water damage. So, I had to get a new one. I had absolutely NO intention of purchasing ANYthing in store, because of the not so good experiences I\u2019ve had at nearby AT&T stores (Schillinger Rd S) l. I\u2019d rather buy online. Even said that to a friend before I called, ha!\nHowever, I had some questions. So, I googled AT&T. I clicked on the first location that popped up, which happened to be the one in Semmes on Moffett and Schillinger. A young man by the name of Jarius answered the phone. Immediately, I could tell how friendly he was and quite humorous\ud83d\ude06 One of those people who you know right off, is just a kind and genuine guy, ya know? He went out of his way to answer the questions I had. Even answered questions I didn\u2019t even ask, but wanted to. Questions that I was afraid to ask. Mainly, because of the last location (Schillinger Rd S) I went to (about a year ago) to get my watch, seemed annoyed and rushed from the very beginning. Which made me feel like a burden rather than a paying customer. It\u2019s actually happened every time I\u2019ve been to that location. Never thought to go to another, because I just assumed that they all act that way. Due to such poor service in the past, it\u2019s now come to the point where I dread having to get any new device from them. Although, that all changed after speaking to Jarius for that brief moment on the phone. After getting the information I needed, I made it a point to go to the Moffett Rd location to purchase my new phone from HIM, specifically. Which ended up being a great decision! I knew exactly who he was when I walked in, based on seeing his pleasant demeanor and friendly facial expressions towards other customers.\n\nHe greeted me, and I told him  what I wanted. He didn\u2019t even ask me what color I wanted. Instead, he took it upon himself to bring ALL five colors out, so I could see them up close in order to make my decision. I chose my phone. He took it out of the box...next thing you know\u2014\u2014\u2014HE has my WHOLE phone set up for me! Even did the facial recognition. This has NEVER happened. From walking in, to leaving, it took about 20 minutes, maybe? Typically, it takes at least an hour to get the phone \u2014which they just give to me to take home and do it myself. Which for me? Takes another hour or two, ha!  By the way, [in the past] I\u2019ve asked them to help me, and they\u2019ve refused. Claiming it\u2019s against policy. Which, I know now, is a lazy lie. It\u2019s been a few days since I\u2019ve gotten my new phone, and yet, I\u2019m still thinking about and telling others of the excellent service I received\u2014sending people their way. Also, I HAVE to mention Tre (the manager) who came over while Jarius was doing his thing. He came over to make sure everything was going smoothly and checked to see if I was getting the best deals they had to offer\u2014which HE made sure I did\ud83d\ude4fHe was friendly, personable, and just all around pleasant. He didn\u2019t have to come over, because Jarius had it all under control. However,  he did, and I saw him doing that with all of the other customers as well. Those two really want people to be satisfied and it\u2019s completely evident.\n\nI, myself, have worked in customer service for about 15 years. So, I appreciate and know good (great!) service when I see it.  As long as Jarius and Tre are working for AT&T\u2014I will continue to go there. Because I literally put off getting a new phone for 2 years (had it for 4) because it always seemed like a chore any time I was thinking of getting a new one. I know this review is a bit lengthy...but the experience was like no other, that just couldn\u2019t be explained in a short summary. That, and they deserve it! Again, thank you Jarius and Tre!!\ud83e\udd17", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bac3edf139c77:0x4fa1700a7dc1ce3a"}

Prior to moving I was told by a AT&T customer service that since the building is already wired for AT&T, all I needed to do was take my router with me and plug it in at my new apartment. I double checked, \u201care you sure?\u201d, to which I was again assured that it was just that simple. Several days later I move and plug the router in. No internet. I call AT&T and tell them what happened, and they scheduled a technician to come to my apartment several days later (Tuesday) to activate my service. It\u2019s Tuesday night now, so I call and ask when I can expect to see the tech. After a long process of being put on hold and transferred to a \u201cmanager\u201d, I\u2019m told that I didn\u2019t actually have an appointment. Even worse, they told me that it would be THREE WEEKS until they\u2019d be able to get someone out to my apartment. I live in downtown Birmingham, a relatively big city, and they don\u2019t have a single tech that can spend 20 minutes activating my internet service. Are you kidding me AT&T? What if I worked from home, or if I had a kid who was learning remotely? What if I caught covid and couldn\u2019t leave for 2 weeks but still had to work? I literally have no other options besides using AT&T and they know this. I was misled multiple times by their representatives, then told to wait for nearly a month for a service I ALREADY PAY FOR. I\u2019ve never posted any sort of product or service complaint, but this is the worst experience I\u2019ve had as a customer.

The atmosphere has become that of a used car lot . The sales Reps work off commission  ,and as soon as they see you are not switching to Direc tv, or whatever else they are selling, they shut down and don\u2019t want to help you. Because of this I have been going to the Apple store to purchase my devices. A few days ago I went into this ATT store to get a new I phone because I needed it ASAP.  I went in to strictly buy an iPhone and nothing else . After declining all the other sales pitches, I pay the sales tax get my receipt and go on my way . The next day I got an email showing the changes to my plan . The sales rep decided she was going to enroll me in the next plan and add insurance to my phone . I didn\u2019t ask for or authorize any of that . She did not mention she was doing it either . This kind of behavior is far past unethical. So the next days I have spent much of my valuable time  calling corporate straightening this out . I have been an Att customer for over 20 years . I no longer have any trust in them .

The manager could not be found and no one knew exactly when he would be in the store. I had to pay a restock fee of $55.00 after being told that there was no way anyone else in the store could give credit back on the additional iPad that was charged to my account.\n\nInitially  the customer service representative told me that my bill would only increase by $5.00. However, I was charged $60.00 for the iPad on the first bill and $24.97 for another iPad I didn\u2019t even buy!! I had to call 611 in order to get a credit on my bill for the amount that I was lied to about. Also, the customer service representative that sold me the iPad was there and did not take the initiative to apologize for the lack of explanation of the bill. There was insurance placed on the iPad without my knowing. I didn\u2019t notice until I looked at the bottom of the receipt and bill on today!  I will never visit this AT&T again.

I then went online and ordered an ATT flip phone because they do still manufacture them. Dad tried to return the phone a couple days later but came back with the phone. Since I know that his mind works differently now I told him we would go back the following Monday, which we did.  My dad was a little upset feeling like he was lied to when we got there----that did not help for sure. The ATT employee was immediately defensive and disrespectful.  I felt sorry for the young man because I know he'll never get anywhere in life like that. I then decided to speak for my dad and push him out of the way to calm his attitude,  but the employee seemed spiteful and maintained his little smirk. Totally not helpful. There was a level headed employee who came over and explained the phone price vs restock fee.  We ended up keeping the phone due to restocking fee.

They asked for my social security number to make sure that I didn\u2019t owe att any money. As the man employee was getting me set up the manager came and took over the entire project. As I was sitting there the manager kept asking me if I owned a business and a bunch of other questions. I answered not knowing that they were signing me up for a business account. Through the entire time I was in there the manager never once told me what he was doing. While I was sitting there he started bragging about setting up drug dealers on business accounts as pharmaceutical companies. And how he has done it many times. So a couple weeks pass and I get a bill in the mail for $126 when the manager told me it would only be $65 plus tax. So I called the store to figure out what happened and the manager called me a liar. So I decided to go to the store the next off day I had. Well today I went to the store and the manager refused to deal with me because I refused to wear a mask for medical reasons. Then after me telling him about the medical issues he still made me wear a mask. And didn\u2019t help in anyway to fix any of the problems I had and called me a liar. And he refused to tell me how to get in touch with anyone over him.  And for everyone wanting to do business with this store please wait until they have someone in management that is honest enough to tell you exactly what they are doing with your personal information. If I could give zero stars I would and hopefully they will get someone competent enough to do business the right and legal way!!! Hopefully someone will see this and get this problem taken care of!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611832291149, "text": "Hi Dylastion! Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

Now I was already having a bad day and looking rough lol, but little does she know, she completely turned my day around and made it brighter with her kind gesture.
