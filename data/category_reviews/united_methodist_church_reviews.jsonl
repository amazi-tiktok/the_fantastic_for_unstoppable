Move after move, Sunday after Sunday.. It's exhausting. This time was ba bit better. Like every research I do I check the websites to see the climate of ea h church, I check reviews and I see about what kid programs they had. Whilst researching Asbury, I noticed that it was Methodist, which good or bad, we always measure up to our home church Cross point in FL. I looked at the kids services and noticed they are very active, looked at the adult services and saw a contempory one, so far so good! Getting there a parking was a breeze. Police to direct traffic and greeters to point you in the right direction. I pre-registered the kids online to make thing go more quickly, and was able to get my son where he needed to be and us to the bathrooms and seated before the singing. To top things off they had complementary coffee, tea and hot chocolate.  The contemporary service was just as expected and we enjoyed the preaching. We will be coming back to this church again this Sunday to check out the earlier service, as they only have a teen service at 0915 not the 1045 service.
