This is the same 2 lane state hwy where an 11 year old girl had recently been hit by a tractor trailer beside her mailbox, with a steady police presence for speeders since.  Nonetheless, a Trantham Farms semi pulling a tanker trailer came up behind us as we were still accelerating from our turn on to the road, getting less than a car length from my rear bumper even after I reach 63-65mph on the 55mph 2 lane road.  I finally pass the car ahead of me but as I leave Roberta on US 341 north, where it's 4 lanes in town with 45mph zone become 2 lanes outside city limits, the same truck suddenly comes flying up on my right just as the last of any pavement for it's lane ends, pushing me into the southbound lane.  This was after the previous 1/4 miles of 4 lanes had several signs indicating the trucks lane ends, and even after vehicles parked on the right shoulder with hazards on should have had the truck over to give clearence in the first place.  I had to slam on my brakes as there was no way to maintain my speed and my lane without the truck hitting me.  All of this occurred within a 10 minutes of turning on to GA 128 back near the Flint.  Now behind the truck, it places between 68 and 72 mph of 2 lane road including GA 42 to Forsyth, a curvy, hilly 16 miles with no passing lanes and only a few short passing zones. It's all on dashcam.  At no time did I brake check, race beside, or otherwise taunt the driver as they drove in a manner that proves they do not belong behind the wheel of these huge vehicles.

Sarah was so great and coordinated the consultation with me when I was in town. We walked through what my vision was and she even did a site visit with mom to the wedding venue. She was awesome giving me a clear vision of what things work and what don\u2019t and with very broad requests on my part ....as I do not know much about flowers and gave her basically a color scheme...she created a beautiful installation for our wedding ceremony and really brought the property to life with her arrangements scattered across the venue. I could not have been more happy with the service and quality of product that Southerly provides, Sarah is a true artist and this husband /wife team are amazing to work with!!!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlDJYq4iq3HhxIjcUEEh5L69ySnugpyNfXdVJ1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgbzavxASE7UUS7AvlX33dbJu18-Zob7QRByWB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyQHKaT1NeSbyagOKtnF-hiCDargG6E3O-FngI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG7sV3OhPvbN-SDdLtMccodagSd9AJVhNV4bMF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnSsniAlWnbIAVXjGhxDgg7uFLx78fkINBP4t_=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeJ6czYOlGVXBI2bkfBpgu-1ZVkV-rcov3MpxH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8860bd87e5618a57:0x7b41ad83ccc6de49"}

But they don\u2019t know how to load trucks right and I seen a lot of them saying: * we have done this for 30 years*, not knowing what is bridge law and axle weights.    First, ask drivers how they want to load 24 pallets. I could easy prove that but I just didn\u2019t want to loose my time and fuel driving up and down that hill from  near Loves Truck Stop. My advice to you guys for loading 24 pallets is do one single in nose then  ALL doubles all the way than single side ways and double , it\u2019s best way, try it and think about it. The way you guys loading trucks, to be legal on the road we have to slide almost all the way to the back trailer tandems which is against the law plus even hard for Rockies drivers to make some turns. So my trailer was 36k pounds going legal to FLORIDA and drives tandes were around 30k lbs. It\u2019s tough to drive like that. I got some pictures for you so you can see how you guys are doing for 30plus years. It\u2019s all about safety!

I was sold immediately on their product! I\u2019ve since ordered from them several times. I buy their whipped shea butter mostly - it\u2019s creamy without being greasy and a little goes a long way! I\u2019ve also purchased their products for gifts - needless to say, my mom and grandmother are now hooked! While this review/comment is based on my experiences with this company on a whole, my most recent experience, specifically, is what encouraged me to form a review for the public. I recently placed an order for two of their gift boxes and a couple of single items. The order contained Mother\u2019s Day gifts for my mom and grandmother. The order was received, processed and delivered PROMPTLY - like within two business days (I didn\u2019t pay extra for expedited shipping). I received a text alert when the product was delivered - around noon, yday. It was quite warm outside and I still had hours before I\u2019d get home from work. I was a bit worried about the product sitting in the heat/sun. As soon as I got home, I unpacked the box. The way it was packed so carefully and with consideration was a plus, BUT I also noticed that there was a Koolit refrigerant pack placed in the bottom of my carefully packed order...packed in anticipation of a warm day and no one being home to receive the package once it arrived. This may seem like a small thing. This may seem like \u201ccommon\u201d sense and good business practices, but as someone who does a LOT of online shopping, I can assure you that many businesses don\u2019t put even a fraction of thought and consideration into packing their product for delivery. 1818 Farms has a lifetime customer!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88627d3f82d38f73:0x9815b0297e8927dc"}
