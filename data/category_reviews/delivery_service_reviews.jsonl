They called us on a Friday to say our furniture could be delivered Monday.  In the voicemail, the company rep kept calling my husband Michelle, when his name is Michael. When she realized halfway through the message that she made a mistake, she said\u2019 \u201cI think it\u2019s supposed to be Michael and not Michelle...anyway...\u201d No apology or anything. When we called to reschedule because we were out of town, the same rep said she would call us back with a new time and day. She never did. We called three times before actually getting someone on the phone. Same rep informed us it would be delivered Tuesday at 12/ noon. Okay. Great. So, Tuesday at noon rolls around, and no one is here. We waited until 1:30 before calling to check the status, to which we got nothing but the voicemail multiple times. When my husband finally got someone on the phone, the same rep informed us that our furniture was scheduled for delivery on Wednesday, not Tuesday. Clearly my husband was upset since we rearranged our schedules and paid extra to keep my daughter in daycare. So, she says our furniture will be delivered Wednesday at 12. Because we had issues with times, I decided to call to make sure it was set for 12, and the same rep, very rudely, began arguing with me about what she said the day before and the times. I was trying to get an estimated time, and she kept interrupting me, and she finally hung up. At this time, I was livid with the situation and called back. Here\u2019s where the actual good part comes in. Said rep hands the phone to the company owner, who was extremely helpful. He listened without interrupting and sympathized with the situation. He informed me that delivery times are always approximately due to problems or delays with other scheduled deliveries and we would see our furniture between 12-4 on Wednesday. It was delivered before 12 the next day in great condition.\n\nThe reason why I am giving this company a 2 star instead of higher is solely bc of the rude and unprofessional receptionist.  She independently will run the company into the ground if she continues to act with other clients the way she did with us.

I called 6-8 moving companies in Montgomery and they were the cheapest by a LANDSLIDE. That\u2019s first off. Secondly the owner Chris spoke to me on the phone and answered my questions but after that it was tricky to get him to return my calls or texts in the same day. But regardless, he was always polite and helpful. A bit\nOre communication on procedures and when to expect emails and confirmations and a deposit would have been helpful if dealing with a new clueless person like myself but it still was fine. Then the movers: first: they were so punctual they were too punctual by about 30 minutes! Lol. That was awesome. Secondly DEVON was amazing. As far as customer service... super friendly and nice and I needed that. I was super stressed. DEVON is a priceless employee from what I saw. 3: BOTH Devon and Alex were SUPER FAST! very very careful with my things also but so fast! This company and these guys are not trying to ride the clock and charge you any more than you neeed to pay. Bottom line, INTEGRITY. From Chris and the movers. Just integrity all around. Alex was quiet but a very very hard worker too. Do to end the review; I am a tough one when it comes to customer service and I could not be more impressed with these guys and I will never use anyone else to move me, asking as I\u2019m in Montgomery. My only suggestion would be from the Administrative side... if someone is not using the web sight to book and doesn\u2019t know the routine... be a tad more communicative and call back sooner. But it all worked out and this , from a customers standpoint is a great company. With Integrity and not trying to rip you off. That\u2019s huge.

Yes, you could have got more flowers from Publix, but I don't sell Publix quality flowers. I only carry the freshest and finest.

They helped my father-in-law unload the smaller U-Haul trailer on Saturday, and they made arrangements to meet us the following morning to help unload the big trailer.\nThey sent  for able-bodied gentleman who were courteous, well mannered, and strong. I will also give them great credit for being industrious since  we were on able to get the U-Haul up our driveway. They subsequently used one of their cars and our van to transfer our  furniture and boxes from the bottom of our driveway to the top parking area and then unload from there. They worked quickly and safely. They finished the job in much less time than I anticipated it would take them.\nMy one critique is that some of the boxes marked \"fragile\"  had things stacked on top of them, and a few boxes with \"this side up\" arrows  were facing the wrong direction.\nOverall \u2013 this was perhaps the most positive experience I've had with a moving company!

I\u2019ll never use this business again. Hope y\u2019all have better experiences if u choose to use them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a39be36586b87:0x3422798ef943900b"}

I could not see the menu when ordering and probably might not ordered the parfait with oreo topping and fruit because it was 3.75 by itself with the combo 6.00. Good though with their famous lemonade I always bought in brookwood mall homewood Alabama as an employee of both end chain stores when I was in retail employment. Things are vastly different these days. I took my minimum wages way more seriously than majority and as a result the easiest to be the odd ball Not defying the odds that hard work pays. It leaves you struggling in poverty. But Im sure that's bitterness rubbing off on me. Got a good photo as my other favorite thing to do getting odd shots most get paid big bucks in print media. My phone controls the best of me but I got this from my destination mall and purpose on a gorgeous stressfilled easter weekend. In auburn Alabama where I worked in undergraduate school there at now gone jcpennys and got my earring piercing on top of my ear that took a year to heal because I kept hitting it with the phone receiver back in 1989 rather than continue commuting on weekends back to my hometown birmingham mall as manager of lingerie and top sales in accessories. When stockings used with garter belts came 3 to a box and my thighs slightly smaller but not much. Its control top reinforced toe now for sharp talon nails on eagle soarers. My joke of the city. And the river a few miles before this chick-fil-a restaurant. If you ordered a ice cream cake from now replaced Badkung Robbins in toomers corner I made it as the cake maker/ decorator for a quarter. Loved that job slicing tubs of ice cream and layering with cake then icing with melted cream inside the cooler before piping your favorite slogan on it. Lastly, was now gone a different cooler in environmental management for water samples which storied life experienced escaped discussion in the water sludge cleaning treatment process I endured to get mosquitos in my puddled location. I will have better to discuss another day when my dining room and laundry socket plugs work again reminding me of my molester's house dynamics that's my Unavoidable problem.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMWitWaNinlSmVPT5SsPVOJaiYb2-O5wTIZA4f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLbPGzV__3sEFWQP-HGRHsixSpoSn26600LBMQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888957bbabc8347f:0xe819f7b20241ba16"}

After my order being messed up and one of my coworkers not getting lunch, I called and let them know the order was not included. This was around 11:30ish. The girl told me her general manager wasn\u2019t there and she would have to get approval from him to fix my order. And she tried telling me I would have to somehow prove that the order wasn\u2019t included, asked me to bring it all back up there when I had already distributed over 5 orders to my coworkers! Not even 20 minutes later Kayleen Turner called them and she says the general manager is there he is just busy, so they lied and she called them out on it and the girl had nothing to say but she offered to bring us the order. She didn\u2019t even want it anymore so she said no just to refund her money. I get a call HOURS later saying I would have to go in the store and get cash because they can\u2019t process it otherwise. Okay, cool. It was very inconvenient but sure. Shortly after they called me, they called Kayleen and she wasn\u2019t able to answer because she was in the middle of selling a car. So after, she called back and said \u201cHey I missed a call from y\u2019all, it was probably about the order for Alyson\u201d and the girl HUNG UP ON HER! So I went in and not once did the manager apologize, not once did she seem to care about the inconvenience, I even brought up the fact that her coworker lied to me on the phone and she said \u201cthe gm didn\u2019t get here until 11.\u201d I told her it was well after 11 that I called and she had nothing to say, did not apologize, just said \u201chave a good night.\u201d and quickly went on to help another customer. Y\u2019all after working in the food industry for so long, it baffles me how some fast food employees AND managers can be so unprofessional, especially when they work at the number one fast food restaurant in the country and are known for treating customers with kindness. I promise I never want to be THAT person, but there\u2019s only so far you can push me. I have never been one to try to lie and haggle to get free food out of any restaurant, and it pisses me off that THEY messed up my order, lied to me, treated me unprofessionally, but I am looked at by them as one of those customers that was there to cuss someone out over them leaving a chicken nugget out of my nugget meal. It is literally not hard at all to treat a customer the right way and I just can\u2019t comprehend how that is so hard for some people to understand. \ud83d\ude11", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546486752558, "text": "Hi, Alyson.

I don\u2019t know who would want to eat and small piece of chicken that is burned. Whoever prepared this meal did not seem to care about the customers at all. The nearest chick fla is in mobile that I know of and I\u2019m really thinking about taking my business. Only good thing about the meal was the sweet tea and the hash browns.
