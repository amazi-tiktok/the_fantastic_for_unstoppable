I will say the French bread was really good. The catfish plate portions were great, but the fish was kinda bland. There wasn't much seasoning on it. I guess the worse thing was I really wanted the bread pudding..... wouldn't you know it, they were out. Out of bread pudding at 6pm on a Saturday night, btw they only have two desserts. I would go back, but wouldn't order the catfish and hopefully they have bread pudding.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8887e5b9bd8d8c0b:0x5d5316f4688294ea"}
