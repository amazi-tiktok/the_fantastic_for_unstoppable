My husband and I are fulltime RV'ers so our RV is our home and my husband travels for work. So when we found out that our exhaust manifold was cracked we needed someone quickly. So without proper research we took it to these guys. They gave us a crazy estimate but was told that it was JUST an estimate, that it really depended on how hard the exhaust manifold was to remove and if any bolts broke as they were removing it. We dropped it off on a Thursday morning at 8:00 a.m. On Monday at noon my husband was informed that the parts were still not in. Then on Monday at 4:00 p.m. my husband was told that it was ready to be picked up. Since we were over an hour away we told them we would pick it up on Tuesday. My husband was also told that the final bill was $2,990.00. WHAT??? We were flabbergasted because they had told my husband that the exhaust manifold came off easy and that no bolts had broken. My husband talked to the service manager and disputed the bill but the service manager would not budge so in order to get our RV back we had to pay it. Then I did my research and talked to several other diesel mechanics and also talked with some other freightliner and cummins mechanics and was told that they seriously overcharged us for the work that is shown on the bill. The bill states the following \"Pulled unit in shop. removed turbo and exhaust manifold. Cleaned the head and the turbo. Installed and torqued new exhaust manifold and turbo with all new gaskets and bolts. Cleaned inside and out. Ran unit. Checked for leaks none found. Parked unit.\" They charged us $175.00 an hour and claimed 14 hours worth of work for a total labor cost of $2,450.00. No mention of any problems whatsoever in removing the exhaust manifold. In my talks with other diesel mechanics I was quoted anywhere from $1,200.00 to at the most (from another freightliner mechanic) $125.00 an hour for labor. And that it should not have taken 14 hours to do the job if there had been no problems. Another mechanic I spoke with said that if the parts were not there at noon but it was finished at 4:00 then it took them at the most 4 hours to \"install and torque the new manifold and turbo with all new gaskets and bolts. Clean inside and out. Run unit. Check for leaks and park the unit.\" That would leave 10 hours for them to remove the exhaust manifold and that is overboard, especially since there were no issues in removing it. I was given some great advice and I am pursuing this. I was told that in order to hold the Freightliner name that they have to abide by a \"Labor Guide\" and to ask to see it (but we had already paid and picked the RV up so I was too late in doing that) so I have requested the labor guide requirements for this type of job. I have also requested quotes from other diesel mechanics based on what they said they did via the bill. And have contacted the main Freightliner offices. It is sad that we as consumers can not completely trust that we won't be screwed when we take our property to people.\nOn top of all of the above, when we were ready to leave my husband asked for the key and lo and behold they had lost it. They could not find the key to our RV. Really?? What kind of business that works on vehicles loses keys? It was a good thing that we had another key with us. I would recommend to do your research before you make a quick decision like we did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602110a7b0ed1:0xc685b4618fec7c7e"}

They are liars and thieves. My husband went to work for WTI in Alabama. Their repair shop is in cahoots with the Freightliner in the same town of Tuscaloosa. Just after a 90 day inspection my husband switched to WTI. They immediately on first day said there he needed over 6000.00 in repairs on his truck. We had no choice st the moment but to get it repaired where he could start work. Freightliner started repair on it. Finished it in THREE WEEKS!! So my husband was out of work for over 4 weeks due to this scam. After he was up & running again here in Pensacola we had to put it in the shop at Freightliner. After a week they found out that none of the parts had been replaced or were either old parts. It took another week to get it approved to not have to pay for the parts and labor on what was done! Then the manager in Pensacola found out that the Work was not even done by a licensed Mechanic in Tuscaloosa!!  Then of course the Pensacola Freightliner found some more things wrong of course. Like they always do. Sigh * we were out of work over 6 weeks due to this. I contacted the owner of the three Freightliner owned by him. One in Tuscaloosa and two in Atlanta area. He wouldn\u2019t call me back at all. If we had had the money and time we would\u2019ve had an attorney. Stay away from WTI in Tuscaloosa & FREIGHTLINER in Tuscaloosa. For the most parts there are is a lot of crookedness at Freightliners some more than others but TUSCALOOSA is the worst!! STAY AWAY!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602110a7b0ed1:0xc685b4618fec7c7e"}
