Any and all receptionist; no matter the department; are extremely rude, speak to patients as if we are ignorant for asking simple questions, and treat every phone conversation as if it's such a bother to do the EASIEST JOB of any emloyee in that hospital! My suggestion would be to either make them all go through better training AGAIN just to keep that job they have been blessed with when so many of us CAN'T find work, or can't work due to our condition. Or clean house and rehire any department answering phones and speaking directly with patients. I ran a customer service DEMANDING business for 6 yrs and my clients favorite thing about me was the fact that I never brought my personal life or feelings to the job, and treated every client with a certain personability easy to relate to and ALWAYS happy to help with a smile! Because THAT'S what customers wanna see. Make them feel like u love being there to help them, not as if it's such an inconvenience to even answer the phone! Or, I would be glad to come show u, first hand, how it's done! See,I hate not having the easy job and watching others do that job so horribly... Yet, still keep it!

I have epilepsy and know for a fact that I do, I have been diagnosed by two different Dr's. The last time I had to be taken in the Dr in the ER  Dr said I wasn't having seizures, what changed her mind was the fact that I had one right before her eyes4 they instantly transported me to a hospital with a neurology department  . Since their are no neurologists at St Clair I wouldn't have chosen it this time but I wasn't aware enough to make the choice. When I got onto the room the Dr came in and recognized me from the last time and make the rude comment \"oh you have another seizure?\" Forget the fact that I had two cuts around my eye and blood on my face and blood that had dripped onto the front of my shirt. I have been and always do take my medications regularly. After a CT scan which took quite awhile to get taken back for, the uncaring Dr which I do not even remember the name of discharged with no stitches no nothing. Even the nurse asked if they had done anything yet, and was clearly surprised that I was not at least given something for the horrible headache that was left behind from the fall and the seizure. This ER is horrible. I had to be taken to another hospital one because they couldn't deal with the Pneumonia I had. If at all costs stay away, if it is a last resort then go by all means and pray that a good Dr is on call that day. I will be getting in touch with my insurance company to tell them of the quality of care and service that i received. Now the nurses on the other hand are INCREDIBLE.

When the doctor finally came in, he \"assumed\" it was strep, never ordered a throat swab or any other tests and said he was going to treat them both as if it was strep. He repeatedly told my older daughter that she was \"not as sick\" as my younger one and that because her throat was not as red, she should feel ok. He prescribed my youngest medicine to take by mouth even though I had informed him that she had been nauseous and even thrown up; to me it would have made more since to give her a shot since she was not keeping liquids down.

He went to the same ER and after much testing including an MRI was told he had an inner ear infection.\nThe hospital bill was less than the doctor's bill, I guess because of the 4 kids.

Waiting an hour before being called to a room in the back was understandable. So, while in the waiting room a nurse took a swab of my child\u2019s nose. Once we were called to a room in the back, we waited 1.5 hour for any sign of a doctor. I stepped out of the room to make sure they had not forgotten about us. By then, the doctor approached as I was asking the nurse behind the counter about how many doctors were actually working. The doctor then introduced himself and I preceded to ask him why has a doctor not checked in with us, at least. He was defensive, and responded as if he was overwhelmed. I can admit that I was frustrated as well. We continued the conversation in the room.  During the doctor\u2019s initial examination, I explained to him that I was concerned about my child having a throat infection because of the way he had been behaving earlier that day. Especially since the flu and MMR swab was negative. He discounted my concern and told me how he had consulted with doctors at Children\u2019s hospital in bham about how it was impossible for a < 2 year old to have strep, and how he had 25 years of experience. He checked my child\u2019s ears but not his throat. He didn\u2019t even attempt to shine a light in his mouth and eyeball his throat. I feel he did not do a thorough examination of my child, and was rushing to a diagnosis because he was obviously overwhelmed. He said that 24/7 St Vincent St Clair only has 1 doctor working the ER. The doctors/staff at St Vincent St Clair should not have the feeling of being overwhelmed. That causes health care of fair to poor quality. An average to excellent doctor would have a challenge working efficiently and effectively in an environment such as the one at St Vincent St Clair.

I was bitten 3 times by a cottonmouth while in the water. 2 times in one ankle and one time in the other. We called ahead of time. Fianc\u00e9 driving me and parents not far behind. The pain was excruciating. I have a zoo animal technology degree and my fianc\u00e9e works with exotics too. There was no doubt what kind of snake it was. My fianc\u00e9e carried me in and I was quickly put in a room. The first doctor was nice and reassuring. They began taking measurments of my legs. Within moments there was a shift change. The new doctor came in. He grabbed one of my ankles as I cried out in pain saying, your grabbing the bite....he dropped my foot to the bed and proceeded to grab my other foot. My mother and fianc\u00e9e explaining I was bit on the back of ankle but he didn't bother to even look at the puncture holes or care. I was given pain medication thru IV but not antivenem. They explained to my dad how expensive it was and how I might not need it. I have insurance and would like to keep my feet so really didnt care about expense. They only kept me for 2 hours and decided to send me home with ibuprofen 800 mg and Ultram. No tetanus shot, no 10 hour monitoring, no bedside manners, no real help at all. My family and I  wanted to see the doctor. The nurse asked him 3 times to come in. I couldn't walk or put my legs down. The doctor came in with a bad attitude asking what do i want him to do. That he can't admit me and that I would need to keep my feet elevated for several days. He was rude to my mom and me. I asked that he stop being mean and help me. How do I get out of bed to wheelchair if I can't walk. He again told me to keep my feet elevated...so apparently I was supposed to levitate to wheelchair. The doctor was horrific so much that it even seem to horrify the nurses. Five days have passed I can not stand or walk. My ankles and feet are swollen and black going all the way up to the knee. No home health care. I can't shower and trying to make it with a bed pan. Thank god for my family otherwise I would be dead not being able to care for myself. According to every hospital in area I should have been given the antivenem. Too late now. Have no idea about when I will be able to walk or when this pain will subside. Never been treated so terribly in my life. Never seen a doctor with so little care for a patient.....not sure if he thought my legs were swelling and turning blue because of something else as he didn't seem to think I was bitten. Three people saw me get bit and again I have a zoo animal tech degree and 40 years old, so I think I would know. I will be calling the hospital and speaking to administration. I CAN'T STAND OR WALK STILL AND I WAS SENT HOME. WHAT KIND OF MEDICINE ARE THESE PEOPLE PRACTICING. DO NOT GO TO THIS ER!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88897d0ab7c4428d:0xeaed684a71b83a5c"}

I had to visit the ER to see about getting g a couple prescriptions, so that I would continue on my meds, and not have any problems. After 45 minutes I finally saw a doctor, and while he said one of the meds was ok, he said they don't prescribe these meds in an emergency room. Um...what? This is an emergency! What kind of sense does that make. I gave him my doctors name and number, I even showed him my bottles,... I was bewildered.  Who turns a cancer patient away to suffer. I understand not prescribing narcotics or whatever but this wasn't anything like that. And I thought doctors swore by the oath to do no harm. Well, my feelings were hurt, and I was beyond upset. Feeling much like a person who knows they will run out of air soon. Panic set in, and thank goodness there are kind hearted people at walgreens, because they called my doctor, had him fax over the info, and filled the prescription.

When he has a Cellulitis outbreak, he has to get medical attention immediately because it is a life-threatening infection that can spread into your lymph nodes and bloodstream quickly. Every single time he has had an issue, we have rushed him to the ER. Nearly every time he has been admitted for anywhere between 2 and 10 days. It is a serious condition.\n\nWill is a truck driver. He was out to pick up a load when he came down with this infection and was so sick that he had to have a stranger take him to the ER at Andalusia Health. Typically, the ER nurses recognize the severity and get to him quickly. Not Andalusia Health. M the waiting room quickly, it was three hours before any medication was administered. Since he was on the road \u2013 and has insurance \u2013 he requested that they admit him for the night so he could regain his strength and get enough medicine in his system to get back home so he could see his doctor. Remember, he had to drive an 18-wheeler all the way back home. The ER staff at Andalusia Health knew this. They refused to admit him, telling him he \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the criteria.\u201d Please, can someone explain what criteria one must fit to be admitted into this hospital? Is it the Harvard of hospitals? He was extremely ill and had insurance. This should have been handled immediately.\n\nWhile he arrived at the ER midday, since he didn\u2019t get to see anyone until late, my mom called the ER to explain his medical history since they would not be able to contact Will\u2019s regular doctor. The nurse she was talking to hung up on her mid-story. And, as Will was getting his bearings and getting dressed to go back to his truck to sleep for the night, he wasn\u2019t fast enough for one of the nurses who told him \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cI know you aren\u2019t feeling well, but you have to go. We need the bed.\u201d Is Andalusia Health a Level 1 trauma center? The ER in a town of 8,787 (as of 2017) is that busy? The hospital has 88 rooms. Was 10% of the town so sick they needed to be in the hospital? I\u2019m asking. No, seriously, I am asking. Someone please tell me.\n\nAndalusia may or may not have Uber drivers, but my brother couldn\u2019t find one. Nor a cab company. He had to call central dispatch and have a police officer take him back to his truck, where he slept overnight, with Cellulitis raging in his body. Without any medical attention. Because Andalusia Health failed. Big time. I don\u2019t know who was on duty other than Sara Purvis, the certified nurse practitioner who saw him. But, I know that Kim Carol is the ER manager. I know that Amy Herrington is the director. I know that every time I have gone to their website, they boast the wait time being 30 minutes or less. I know that they claim to have \u201cexperienced\u201d ER physicians and staff. I know that they failed to live up to that promise. I know that I expect a call from Kohen Johns Brannon today. I know that someone needs to clarify what happened and why it happened. I know that my brother is still sick and sitting in a truck in Andalusia, Alabama right now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8891ec06094fcf01:0x227d8f1880a09251"}

Our son was in her care, and after checking him in, our granddaddy took a turn. I called Dr Kathrine freeman to advice we would be checking our son out for the funeral so he could say goodbye to the only granddaddy he has ever known since he is adopted. Dr Kathrine Freeman said she wouldn\u2019t advise that. I told her I appreciated her advice but we\u2019d still be taking our son to the funeral as that is what families do in Alabama. Evidently she isn\u2019t from the south?  She had already explained her it was her opinion that my son didn\u2019t understand anything. My son is autistic with a low iq. He understands just fine, the issue is figuring out how he processes things.  On top of her calling Alabama\u2019s dhr supervisor in an attempt to block me from taking our son, she also attempted to issues an AMA (against medical advice) which could cause our insurance company to\nReject the charges, and refused to send any prescriptions for the mental health drugs my son receives.  When your child\nHas been on mental health drugs for more\nThan a week or so it\u2019s very dangerous to stop them cold turkey.

At this point we are now filing a formal complaint with the Alabama Board to review this Dr\u2019s lack of professionalism and dangerous practice of dropping a patient without necessary mind altering medications.\n\nI\u2019m really disappointed that she turned out not to be the caring dr we thought her to be and instead a very dangerous one.\n\nJessie Odell", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bea4bce36ed:0xc9ccc128bad63c1b"}

Yes...they have a helicopter landing pad for major medical emergencies! Their genuine concern is doing the best they can do for their patients, with the limited resources that they have! I was very impressed and I left feeling better than when I first got there...I mean, after all, that is the reason for going to the ER to begin with, right?\n\nThe avatar (photo of the hospital) that someone decided to use is \"stock\" imagery and is not a photograph of the hospital...in fact, it's not a photo at all, it's a drawing! That photo never concerned me! I don't feel the image was used to \"lure people in\" deceptively! It is just a generic photograph used as an avatar...nothing more, nothing less! I took a photograph of the hospital, that I decided to share, for those who want to see what the hospital looks like!\n\nNOTE: There is a pharmacy located in front of the hospital, though I do not recall the name of the pharmacy or the hours of operation?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c6536b0662dbd:0x10c103a8c29fc833"}

As a matter of fact I just had an appointment there two weeks ago with the incredible Dr. Priscilla Fowler and staff.   I've been diagnosed with Kerataconus and Dr. Priscilla Fowler is my primary eye doctor.  Dr. Fowler and staff are some of the nicest people I've met in the eye care industry. Earlier this year and this past month I received the Cross-Linking  procedure.  I spent over $6000 within the last three years at Callahan eye.  Dr. Fowler and staff treat me with respect on EVERY visit,  yet on December 10 with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff I felt the lesser of.  This visit was scheduled to replace my old sclera lenses with new.  You would think before my arrival they would've did their research on my condition.  Upon my arrival in the room, Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse asked if I ever had sclera lenses?? (I'VE HAD SCLERA CONTACTS FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS??) From there, he goes straight into and I quote, \"before we even see you, you have to pay X amount of dollars!?. Furthermore, he adds, \"The Lenses will be an additional $XXXX.XX amount of dollars to get them?   Now at this point I was feeling as though they did not want to help me as Dr. Fowler and staff did you for the last couple of years.?  Now do mind you I've already spent thousands of dollars to get my eyes corrected.  The money is not an option, but I felt inferior to his demands.  I also wondered have they even looked in my charts from previous visits.? \"Have they even checked my insurance\" I thought to myself?  At that point I asked him a series of questions in terms of verifying my insurances and deductibles. To no avail he says nothing will be covered. Now as I mentioned money would not be a concern as I've spent a lot of money to fix my Eye disease. ( As well as the removal of an tumor in my eyelid two years prior ).  More questions came to mind in this parlay with Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse.  At this point I felt that the nurse is trying to rush me so he leaves then comes back with a business card and prices on it. He then states, \" if you have any questions please call Melissa\" on the business card. I agreed and proceeded to leave. Upon leaving, I felt very embarrassed to even be there. I rushed out and got in my car. I kept thinking to myself \"have they even check my insurance\". So I called my wife, and she confirmed we do have Eye insurance.  I decided I needed to call them back to confirm and verify with them that I have insurance, the same insurance I've used last three years. Two calls later and one left message, I still have not heard from Melissa, Dr. Rosenstiel , or the male nurse that was talking to me. I never even got to meet Dr. Rosenstiel??? I will still come up to visit Dr. Fowler but I will do my business elsewhere in finding new Sclera lenses!\nVery disappointing!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bea1d7b458b:0x2741eb9855e3054"}

All of a sudden the receptionist, patients and staff are running screaming at me to run down the hall. They scream over the intercom code silver. I get up and start going down the hall. The first waiting room I came to was x-ray. The staff inside locks the door and I\u2019m tapping on the window to find out what\u2019s going on. Just so happens I know one of the woman working there. A gentleman asks her if she knows me and she replies yes. They slip me a note through the door telling me to call them in 15 minutes. I hear a woman inside say get forceful and tell him to leave. I turn to look down the hall and every soul is gone except for me and the man who stole a gun out of a car in the parking lot. I had no idea where he was. No one would help me or tell me what was going on. I was locked out in the hallway that is at least 80 yards long by myself with no means to defend myself. The man was obviously sick and out of his mind. I saw him when I pulled up and he gave me an uneasy feeling. I was not scared for me but thought to myself what if an elderly/young woman or a child walked in the door behind him what would they do. The only thing I could think to use to defend my self was a chair that was sitting in the radiology waiting area. I said to myself he will probably shoot me but hopefully I can beat him enough with the chair that he couldn\u2019t hurt anyone else. I was starring down the hall waiting for him to walk/run towards me and I was going to do my best to stop him with a chair. Another thought I had was if I had my gun on me I would at least be in a better position to defend myself. Luckily the police got there and disarmed the man. I was so mad at the hospital staff for telling me to run down the hall and then locking me out of EVERYTHING. I was nothing more than a target at that point. I could understand their policy a little better if I hadn\u2019t been waiting for 45 minutes in the same chair they ask me to flee from while rushing other patients into offices to protect them from a possibility bad outcome. I asked the Administrator what was the big plan for me. Wait till he shoots me then scurry on over to the E.R. All he said was this is not supposed to happen here. Needless to say I am extremely, extremely disappointed in the way St. Vincent\u2019s Blount handled things today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I waited and I waited and I waited. I filed two complaints and then finally I get a primary doctor in January. Yes you read that right January. I see my primary doctor, and I request to see a specialty doctor. He puts in the console and I'm waiting and waiting to to no aveil. I called up Community Care (you have to call them as soon as they open,or else you'll never get a chance to talk to anybody.) I told them it's been a long time since my doctor put in the referrals. Why hasn't anything happen? They said it was kicksd back because of an error. I asked him why didn't they inform me or the doctor?they said it was because it was a doctor's fault. Which I know it was totally their fault. That's another thing they don't take responsibility for nothing. I almost forgot to mention prior to that, when I was trying to get my primary doctor they couldn't even do the most simplest things like send the referral to the doctors. They told me that they did it but in actuality they didn't. They are so full of themselves and they're very unapologetic. They just don't care, and nothing ever happens to them. They never get in trouble. They're telling me that I need to check up to see if I get my referrals. That is absurd, I've never called community Care in El Paso once to see when my referrals have been approved and I was waiting on it the doctor. In El Paso I dealt with TriWest. I don't even know what we deal with here.

Three hours later a doctor and nurse finally came in to apply skin glue to the cut.  They didn't really seem to know what they were doing and just plastered the glue all over the wound like a 3-year-old with a glue stick and then sent us home.  Having had skin glue used before, I knew this did not look right and you could immediately tell the glue had not sealed the wound because you see fluids building up under it.  Sure enough, by the middle of the next morning the glue had fallen off and the wound was open again.  I decided to just deal with it at home.  I can't believe that I wasted 3 hours and a huge co-pay for this level of incompetence and lack of effective treatment.

Be aware that while Baptist Endoscopy Center and your gastroenterologist doctor may be in-network for insurance purposes when you do your due diligence and check on network status prior to a procedure, the Endoscopy Center uses out-of-network anesthesiologists who will balance bill the patient resulting in those dreaded surprise high medical bills.  Premier Anesthesia of Montgomery will get hundreds more than the hospital and more than 4 times what the doctor receives for a routine endoscopy that takes about an hour.  Shame on Baptist for not requiring the anesthesiologists to accept network rates.  Update.  After the Baptist response I contacted the patient advocate who told me this was a provider billing issue not involving Baptist.  That is exactly my point.

I went to the emergency room this past weekend because I was coughing so hard I was vomiting, and I was also suffering some neurological symptoms from an allergic reaction to medication earlier in the week. Of course, they wouldn't let my husband go in with me, which is reasonable because of COVID, but still stressful to be in the ER alone. They quickly got me into a room and said they were going to give me IV fluids. They placed a line in my hand (my veins are impossible), took blood, did a chest x-ray and did a urine screen.\n\nAn hour and a half went by and I didn't see any doctors or nurses. During that time, I became dizzy and lost consciousness, but no medical personnel knew because they hadn't looked in on me at all. Shortly after I woke up, a nurse named Chelsea came in my room. We spoke briefly, and I told her my mouth was dry, so she brought me lemon flavored q-tip. That was the only \"medication\" I was given the entire visit. After she left, I had a panic attack. I will have a panic attack at the ER on a good day, but this was particulary stressful, as I was alone and suffering from frightening neurological symptoms.\n\nI hit the call button, said I was having a panic attack and could they give me some medication or could my husband bring my prescription from home. They said he could not, but they would take care of it. 45 minutes went by, and I was finally able to self-soothe enough that I was at least able to take a few breaths. I left my room to use the restroom next door, and saw three or four people sitting around a cluster of desks in the center casually chatting. I immediately gathered my things and asked them where the exit is. They nonchalantly directed me, until they saw the IV in my hand and said I absolutely could not leave. I asked why, since they weren't treating me and no one had seen me in hours.\n\nThe charge nurse asked to speak to me privately in my room, and laid blame on radiology being slow, explaining thats why no one had been taking care of me. I completely understand that the emergency department can't rush the radiology department, but I explained to her that no one had even bothered to peek in on me, when I was having neurological symptoms and losing consciousness, that I had been denied water and given a cotton ball, was told I would be given fluids but wasn't, but they had placed an IV port in the back of my hand anyway. I explained to her that I had a panic attack, that I had notified the nursing staff, they said they would take care of me, and not only did they not give me any medication, they didn't even come in the room to see how I was doing. I said I needed to leave and go to another ER since they refused to treat me.\n\nShe said my test results were coming back, and wouldn't I like to wait since I'd have to start all over at another ER. I said she had ten minutes to give me information or treat me. Everything came back normal. I left still suffering significant neurological issues and was still gasping for air and vomiting from my severe cough.

The only thing that I can say that I would have to complain about is the overnight shift nursing staff on the first floor wasn't very friendly or compassionate.\nWhen it came down to the patient's it was like they were just there to get paid and could really care less\nAbout the person as a human being but yet they were constantly playing these sweet lullabies over the intercom and if you would look deeper into the name BAPTIST you would discover that BAPTIST EQUALS CHRISTIAN CHURCH,  pictures of crosses are on the hospitals socks but yet the overnight nursing staff seems to need some serious interventions because they act like everything but Christian. I mean they were loudly laughing and talking in the halls throughout the middle of the night when sick people were trying to get their rest. A PCT was dancing around when she should have been doing her job and being professional. A night shift RN refused me a small cup of juice when I requested for a drink.\nBut I found it funny how when the morning shift took over the morning shift had no problem whatsoever getting the juice I requested. Day shift fulfilled each and every single one of my requests with no problems whatsoever at all.

Personally I love the DOCTOR'S AND ALL OF THE DAY SHIFT NURSING STAFF. but to be honest baptist east could seriously consider moving forward without such inconsiderate\nOvernight nursing staff. I mean it's like their saying: IM IN CHARGE, I WORK HERE YOU DONT, IM THE BOSS OF YOU, AND I TREAT YOU HOWEVER I PLEASE OR SOMETHING! When in fact PATIENT'S ARE ANY HOSPITAL'S  MOST PRIMARY FOCUS\nBecause the money that comes from the patient and/or their insurance company IS WHAT PAYS THESE PEOPLE'S SALARY.

I went in very nauseated, and within minutes I was getting something for that.  She also checked on me frequently because she knew I really did not feel well and was in a lot of pain.  She explained all of the tests that they had to run, and made sure I understood what was going on.  I am a very hard person to start and IV in, but she got it on the first try and I honestly felt no pain.  I can go on and on about her care, but the one thing that really impressed me as going above and beyond....she knew my husband had to leave work to take me to the ER.  She also knew this was a concern.  When she brought my check-out papers, she brought him a work excuse.  We did not even have to ask.\n\nI wish I could name everyone who cared for me, but I can't remember all of their names.  The x-ray technician, the CT scan technician, the lab technician, the Nurse Practitioner, and even the triage nurses were all extremely nice, and gentle.  Another nurse that came by to check on me was Allie.  She was also very, very sweet and took care of my needs.  I was also very impressed when the pharmacist came to see me to make sure he was giving me the proper medicine.  I have never had that happen before.\n\nIf I could give you all a grade for this visit, I would definitely give you an A+.  Thank you for taking such good care of me.

The nurse that evening, Jayce, was kind and helpful, but the ICU desk was so loud at 3:00am that not only could I not sleep, but I had to sit up and crank the volume up to 100% in order to drown out the senseless and disrespectful noise at that hour. The nurses that came in the next morning were satisfied doing the bare minimum and gave attitude when asked for assistance or information, I was expected to use the restroom on a chair into a bedpan infront of the helpdesk with the door and the curtain wide open open. Sorry but I was raised with manners. I was then passed onto the next awful nurse with two request: \"I aked if I could shower and not have an I've in the crook of my right arm. 35hrs later no shower and a bleeding iv in the right arm. Both request to shower and have this Iv moved have been denied and passed on to the next incompetent\" . Worth is the most worthless nurse I have ever met! Coming out of ICU my vitals were never checked, I was made to fill out a fall risk form and confined to my bed without access to use the restroom and forced to wait 45min to an hr before I was helped. The worst of all was that I went 6hrs after major mascular surgey without any pain medication due to Worths incompetence. She spent more time making excuses and trying to get around her work instead of spending that time finding a solution. She did not hook up the medication correctly and it ran out of the pump onto the floor, when confronted she was unwilling to accept responsibility for her actions, even after she was called out infront of the Dr., her reply was: \"Well...what happened was\". She had told him a completely different version outside the room not thinking I would bring it up with the Dr in the room. My next nurse was Jonothan\ud83d\ude48Also refusing a shower and to move my iv that shuts off due to placement every 6hrs that my antibiotics are hooked up, creating three extra trips for one 30min treatment, not to mention the countless times I have made these requests for my personal comfort during my stay. I was told by Jonothan that was being given an opiated based paIn killer \"Valium\". I asked: \"isn't Valium a benzodiazapam used for anxiety and muscle spasmsam\". Of course I was wrong until Google provided the nurse, Jonothan, with an acceptable answer. I have requested an antacid for extreme heartburn, ulsers, and hiatal hernia in my esophageal tube, of course that agin was too demanding of a request. I am truly and utterly disappointed in my visit to Baptist East Medical Center. This place used to be nice, not sure why there is such widespread incompetence throughout the staff here. Thanks Baptist Eastfor the WORST hospital visit of my life! I am appalled at the quality of your health care. I will not be returning, I would rather be treated in the waiting room at Jackson Hospital!

Also, the place is a tad bit like a maze without clear directions/signs so that\u2019s super fun to be in too!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b5dfce2c4c3:0x356d1e296adfa416"}

I am 32 years old and suffer from CPTSD. I went in last week after binge drinking (I was suicidal) with symptoms of alcohol poisoning, had been throwing up, dry heaving, and hyperventilating for 12 hrs. I had not been able to keep any food or fluids down in that time. They used a child's blood pressure band on me and it was way too tight and squeezed my arm to where I cried out. Told me nothing about my blood pressure reading and said to keep the band on bc they would use it again in exam room. Waiting room was not that busy; 1 hr later I was feeling much better, finally got seen after waiting 1.5 hrs. One nurse removed the blood pressure band and said it was not appropriate for me and got me a different band which fit better. I saw about 4 nurses and 1 dr; one nurse did not come back after she received my urine sample. Another nurse came in 10 mins later and asked what had been done for me; I said almost nothing but there was my urine ready for them. Every nurse and the Dr. I saw knew nothing about my condition and obviously had not even glanced at my chart. A sick person should not have to do all the work at a hospital. I was told my urine sample wasn't great for them to determine a UTI and something about white blood cell counts were high. No one checked my vitals until I mentioned a chronic respiratory issue and asked if it had anything to do with the white blood cell counts. Dr checked my breathing and offered an x-ray, but I said we would get it done elsewhere as that would be cheaper. I have no insurance and my Dad paid out of pocket for me to be 'seen'. At least the charge wasn't so high, so that was the best part of my experience there. Never got a pregnancy test result yea or nay. I asked the Dr. And two nurses for a copy of my urinalysis and was ignored. Finally someone told me the research lab would be open the following day (this was Sunday) and I could get a paper copy then if I wanted. I was also told about the patient portal. We paid on the way out and I asked about my labs. The receptionist asked for my email address and said she would send me a link to the portal where I could see my report. I gave it to her and she said 'done'. I never got the email. Monday, I called the hospital and was transferred to a different department where I left a message. It is now Friday and I've yet to receive my email or official results stating what was on my urinalysis. I never go to the hospital and this made me never want to go again. I finally got fluids and Zofran and a GI cocktail, then discharged after 45 mins of IV fluids. I had to beg for a glass of water bc I was still dehydrated and thirsty.

I was having severe shoulder pain. They gave me a steriod shot in the hip and sent me home. As the day went on my back, right side , and chest swelled up so bad I could barely move OR breath in. So I went to another hospital. They right away gave me something threw my IV to take the swelling down. Then a muscle relaxer. I swear I felt brand new again. These people cared.

Then, since 2015 my dad has been going in with issues with his pancreas. They kept sending him home for years. Then this year when they sent him home saying they didn't see any stones or anything, he went to Huntsville and his stones were so bad they were going into his pancreas. They said he was not long from dying. They did emergency surgery to get clean the stones from his pancreas and took out his gall bladder. What are the chances only the people I know have had these experiences from athens? I wouldn't trust them with my loved ones or my life. They have killed and almost killed too many people. In January 2019 my dad did end up dying. Them letting his pancreas get destroyed by the stones caused him cancer in his pancreas which spread and after a few years if fighting it, he lost his battle. \ud83d\ude14", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b5dfce2c4c3:0x356d1e296adfa416"}

My thoughts are, if you're going to work in that field you know youre going to be around sick people. Sometimes it can get gross. If you can't handle it don't get in that line of work. Also, if a person already feels bad or has terrible anxiety, the worst thing you can do is be rude and dismissive of them. I guess everyone is human.

WE get seen by a doctor that walks in without looking at the chart just starts off the cuff trying to figure things out. Doc never check for cyst rupture, and offer ONLY 1 LORTAB. We alert her to the allergy, Doc doesn't care, says that\" Lortab is all they have\".\n\nWe advise her that we were treated at Huntsville hospital for this last year, and Dilaudid was given (commonplace practice) as lortab is simply not strong enough for this type of pain. Doctor laughs at us and says there should be no need for something THAT STRONG. We ask her to just look at the Huntsville Hospital records. Doctor informs us that they don't have access to HH records. Not sure if this is a lie, or truth, but either way its unacceptable.\n\nThis was from a female doctor mind you- getting no sympathy for one of the worst female pains there is- was unsettling.  At that point we tell the doctor we want to go home- no real tests were run, we're done.  Doc says she's concerned about patient's appendix. We humor her in the interest of compliance. They run a CT scan w/o contrast and decide she has appendicitis. Knowing full well this is an ovarian cyst and wanting a second opinion, we  left against medical advice.\n\nWe then go to our main doctor at Vanderbilt and they try to contact Athens Hospital and they have lost the CT image less than 24 hours later. They do fax over a paper saying my wife has appendicitis. We then have spent the last 48 hours carefully monitoring and testing for appendicitis(complicated by blood loss from ruptured ovarian cyst and resulting renal insufficiency) . Results negative.

After my surgery, I came out of recovery in agonizing pain and the nurses and another lady (I don't know who she was or why she was even in my room) was very mean and rude to me because I was crying because I was in so much pain, they told me to stop entertaining people and showing out there was no way I was in that much pain, well come to find out my morphine pump was not working which means I just had major surgery and NO pain meds in my system!!!! So finally a guy (not a nurse) came in and figured that out. So you think it would get better from there... WRONG! The same nurse took 30 - 45 mins to get in my room when I would push the button, at the time the only reason I was pushing the button is because the machine went off over and over again, so I did not receive any rest. The 3rd shift nurse was amazing she was my only saving grace during this whole experience. So around 1 am they check my vitals and my BP was bottoming out due to the Morphine, so they took me off the morphine pump, at 7ish am I was starting to have constant pain again and I asked for some more meds (mind you this is 6 hours after they take me off morphine) I did not know this was shift change and another new RUDE nurse comes in and says she has to read her \"reports\" before she can do anything 2 hrs later and now in horrible pain again she brings me pain meds, They finally get me ready for discharge (THANK GOD!!) and told my husband to go down stairs and they would wheel me down, I wait 30 mins and no one has came back to get me, so I get up and start to walk and try to find the elevator because this is my 1st time in this hospital, the PCA lady see's me and says you can't be walking out and took me back to my room and about 5 mins later a elderly and I mean ELDERLY man comes in with a wheelchair and takes me to my husband and he could not keep up with the wheel chair and let it go and my husband had to catch it before I hit the car!\nWhile all this sounds incredibly strange and outrageous this ALL happened to me at this hospital, I've never experienced such horrible treatment from horrible staff in my life!!

The nurses were mostly kind, but they dropped the ball several times.  When I came out of surgery the nurses left the IPC device unplugged until I woke up from my morphine induced sleep 6 hours later.  It was good that I educated myself beforehand so that I knew that they needed to turn it on.  The next problem was their lack of food options.  I eat a very clean diet, so the heavily processed and salty food just destroyed my stomach. I decided to go without food instead of making myself sick with their food.  On the night of June 16th, my nurse had a trainee and neither one of them offered to help me walk the halls.  I explained that I was in extreme pain and suffering from nausea and dizziness.  I made it to the restroom on my own 3 times and asked them to please review the cup and dispose of it.  The night nurses did not check on me, so I was left to care for it in my own.  When i finally fell asleep, I was woken around midnight by the loud crackling of the 2 nurses.  In the morning I explained that the meds weren't helping with my pain, nausea, or dizziness.  The nurse told me that I needed to take more meds or showering would be unbearable.  She was very abrassive and kept trying to push me take more meds.  Never once did she offer to help me to walk in order to relieve some of the pressure.  I was listed as a fall risk (due to anemia), and the nurses instructed me to shower on my own.  I barely made it back to the bed before passing out.  I clicked the nurse help button and the new nurse on duty came in to help me get back in bed.  The lab tech that drew my blood (the second time) was not any more considerate of my pain.  She immediately rammed her cart into my bed and blamed it on her supervisor not getting her a cart with brakes. She then inserted the needle wrong and had to restick me.  It looks like the hospital needs to up their training in compassion for the majority of their nurses.  The one nurse that was like an angel was Beatrice.  I think the younger nurses should watch and follow her lead.  Thankfully I was released soon after.  I'm able to walk with the help of my husband and he regularly reminds me to do my breathing exercise to avoid post op pneumonia. It seems easy enough to take care of yourself after a surgery, but I spent most of the time sleeping or in pain.  Thr nurses told me that I needed to walk the halls 3x/day and not a single one of them offered to help me despite the fact that I was a fall risk.  I needed the nurses to remind me and help me to take care of myself, and they failed at that several times.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592844490963, "text": "We're disappointed to hear of these experiences.

Speaking on the behalf of My wife . Her first visit two months ago, it was terrible. I went to the hospital to sit with my wife . As i went through the emergency room to see exactly how to find her . An African American lady rudely described how to get to the \u201cfast track \u201c room . I followed directions and it was an empty floor with dimes lights on one end of the hall and light on the other end of the hall . Let\u2019s not forget i am not from Alabama. I am from Illinois. There was no nurse to be found . I stumbled across a worker who was janitor and asked did he see any nurses . He stated he doesn\u2019t know . I called the emergency room off of my phone for directions to find the fast track room . Her voice grew as i was confused on finding the room . And as she got frustrated she said i can come back downstairs because my wife was discharged. As the janitor continues to work i ask him how do i get back downstairs , he politely gave me directions to the elevator. As i pass the empty dark patient rooms on the second floor , i stumbled past the fast track room . As i begin to knock i hear nurses laughing uncontrollably and loud . The nurse answer the door and asked what is it that i need as if i was interrupting as she chew her sandwich in her mouth and sandwich in her hand . I told her i was looking for my wife and why isn\u2019t there a nurse on the floor as i walked around for an half hour looking for help as you nurses have the door closed . She showed me to my wife. I ask the nurse why did the emergency room associate who sign people in tell me that my wife was being discharged . She stated that she doesn\u2019t know . I sat with my wife and asked how was she she said that the service is terrible and believe the nurses has no idea what they are doing . Blood was on the wall i asked why she said the nurse caused that from the needle she put into her and another nurse was making the previous nurse clean it up but she didn\u2019t finish . As i stayed i complained about the hospitality of the workers there . The nurses didn\u2019t state what they were doing every move they made on her . And i wanted to ask just to see if they were going to say something. And they didn\u2019t as they finished up with her we hurry up and left . Yesterday we went to the same enterprise hospital because my wife was in pain . We were the only two in the emergency room at 4 am . They er clerk said the doctors were situating a person that came in through ambulance. Which made me question exactly how many doctors and nurses are there . The nurses were better this time but the shadow girl never stated who she was . The doctor came in and said they couldn\u2019t find exactly what was causing her pain as they lazy butt barely tried to find out . They gave her medicine AT the hospital and said that\u2019s all they are going to give her for her pain in the stomach . We went home and she woke back up with pain just a few hours later . We went to flowers hospital and the hospitality was amazing it was faster and more professional and caring than enterprise hospital and they asked why did the nurse do this but not that . We didn\u2019t know but we knew enterprise hospital was a bad hospital not to mention they weight machine did not work at all . Crazy right?!? Despite the drive . It was worth it because Flowers found the underlying problem enterprise hospital failed to figure out . With something that only took an x ray to find out . And was seen by two different doctors with in the same hour . It\u2019s sad. I would never recommend anybody go to enterprise hospital even if they were dying . I hope it gets better for the community and those who depend on this hospital. On the other hand thanks to flowers for everything.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926c2431ffc953:0x4f7011db67be22d6"}

She numbed HALF of my body(I found out later the same thing happened to a neighbor of mine who gave birth here). 26 hours of having these idiots mess with me and me being in so much pain, I really was crap at standing up for myself, my doctor showed up at about 25 hours of me being at the hospital and decided that I needed a C-section! I hate these people so much, there are no words! Woman have been giving birth for thousands of years, this place does not treat birth like a natural process, they treat it like a medical problem.

In September last year they said they would refund monies paid in and I'm yet to see this. (July 2016) I made contact telephonically with the business office again and now they claim their holding the funds due to a recent bill submitted for routine blood work (lab), that Enterprise Express Care (affiliated with MCE) sent them, instead of sending it to a regular lab that charges a normal amount. The hospital billed my insurance Co $4333.70 for 3 vials of blood, consisting of 7 tests!!!! Ludicrous, to say the least. Very disappointed and I'm waiting for the business office to get back with me, however I believe an Attorney is going to end up making some money, since I'm tired of blood-thirsty leaches!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926c2431ffc953:0x4f7011db67be22d6"}

I told the nurses she needed medicine for her fever. Almost 1 1/2 hours later they come back with the medicine and strep and flu test. I ask for the nurse to check her ears, she says she will and just WALKS out the room! Zia was burning up and miserable. I continued to wait . the \"Doctor\" comes back roughly 30  minutes later and tells me both test were negative . Im wondering if she was a nurse instead of a doctor)\nShe looked at her ears after I asked her personally twice after I explained she has been tugging at her ears. She glanced in , I'm not sure if she even looked well enough to tell if an ear infection could be bothering her.\nNow here's the part that got me .\n\nI asked her to take a blood sample from zia to check her white blood count . Her unexpected response was.\n\"No , I'm not gonna take her blood\" I had a confused look on my face.\nShe proceed to say \"ohhh viruses are known for high fevers, like 102,103,104\"\nFalse. Bacterial infections are known for being accompanied by high fever.\nShe also told me \"a 104 temp is nothing to worry about in a baby\"\nOh yeah nothing to worry about besides ya know febrile seizures and brain damage if it went just 2 degrees higher -eye roll -\n\nIt went quiet for probably about 30 seconds and she buts in \"even if we were to take her blood and it come back with a high white blood count (meaning infection) I wouldn't prescribe antibiotics because I AM NOT attempting to figure out what's wrong with her tonight, its more than likely viral just follow up with her pediatrician just in case our test came back false,\" then walked out.\n\nAt this point the nurse walks in to retake my daughters temp.

That was about the only good part except friendly nursing staff. I just seemed like there was no rush to help a three year old. Not only did we wait for a doctor for a long period of time. We had to wait for the doctor to ask another doctor about our son's injury.\nWhen we finally got some info it was fairly vague and we were told to take him home and make an appointment with this other doctor for the next day. They asked us if we wanted the nurses to set up the appointment. We said yes that would be great. When we were ready to leave we were told to pick up our son's meds at CVS and given the paperwork to make the appointment... Which they had said they could do.\nAfter we left we headed to CVS, found out that they had NOT put in the Med request at CVS. They had actually put it in at Walgreens. We drove to Walgreens, waited for them to fill the order (they did not have it ready after it being in their system over an hour). Found out that Walgreens does NOT accept our insurance after waiting 20 mins. Called the emergency room back and asked them to put the request in at Publix and asked them to call me when they had done it. I got the call and headed over  to publix a few hours later. Once we got there we found out that they had NOT put in the order at publix. This place has the worst service ever. It's scary, if I had another hospital to take my son I would have.

These are classic symptoms of congestive heart failure and the expected course of workup would be ECG, chest xray and echocardiagram.  These are fast, inexpensive tests.\n\nInstead the ER staff seemed to suspect abdominal carcinoma (granted a possibility but pitting edema indicates heart) and investigated her liver using CT imaging with contrast media.\n\nAs far as I know, she was never given a simple ECG and/or echocardiagram which would have revealed  (to competent staff, anyway) the underlying cause of the edema - - congestive heart failure due to atrial fibrillation - - the most common cardiac arrythmia in the USA.  She was sent home with a prescription for a diuretic and orders to follow up with her primary care doctor in 4-5 days -- NO MENTION OF GREATLY INCREASED STROKE RISK from the undiagnosed a-fib.\n\nIn the end the ER billed Medicare for expensive, unnecessary CT imaging when a simple ECG would have revealed the root problem.

I could walk 2-5 miles with no limp before this onset, don't take pain pills, have not been admitted to any hospital since 1976 ,clean my own gutters, horseback ride etc. He repeatedly referred to my old knee.

She called me at 11:30pm to say she felt lightheaded, a little dizzy, and had what felt like a slight pressure in her chest. She called the ambulance and the EMT's took her to St. Vincent's to be checked out.\n\nI had left Montgomery immediately after receiving the call and arrived at the hospital minutes after her ambulance had arrived (the EMT's were just bringing out the gurney to their rig when I got there) I went into the Emergency Room, told them why I was there and gave them info on my mom (name, date of birth, address, phone, and reason for admittance). The woman told me they were going to get her in a room and then ask when I could come back. I was the ONLY person in the waiting room. About 20 minutes later she said again that they had her in a room and would see when I could go back. Fifteen minutes after that she said a woman had just gone back to see if I could go back. Needless to say it was over an hour before they let me go back. The worst part is that I had assumed they would at least let my mom know I was there. Even though she had been asking them and voicing concerns about how I had not yet arrived no one from the waiting room told her I was there and none of the nurses back with my mom bothered to check if I had arrived. This was not a far walk either, considering my mom was approx. 30 ft inside the doors from the waiting room I was in.\n\nWhen I finally did get back to see her she was hooked up to a heart and pulse/ox monitor and they had a fluid IV in. They took her out to get chest X-rays and a CT scan minutes after I got back there. When she returned to the room about 15 minutes later, the nurse that brought her back first said she didn't know how to hook my mom back up to the machine and the IV...then was going to try...then decided no, she would have someone come in and do it. A half hour went by and no one came in to hook her back up. I stepped outside the door and explained that she had not been hooked back up and the nurse at the station said thanks, and they would come in and do it...which they never did. The original doctor she saw was also standing there when I told the nurse and did nothing. You would think if you were monitoring someone who you think may have had a heart attack you would want them hooked up to a monitor.\n\nFinally, the doctor came in a little before 4am and said that the X-rays, and CT scan were just fine, but there were concerns with her blood work (PS no one had ever come in to hook my mom back up to the monitors). The doctor explained there are three types of cardiac enzymes. One that tells if there is actual muscle damage and that they use to determine if you've had a heart attack (which was normal and my mom did not), and two others. One of the extra two was normal and then the doctor said that the third was \"significantly higher.\" She said that could indicate that although she may not have had a heart attack that enzyme could mean there could be something brewing or big That could happen on the horizon. She wanted to admit my mom so she could see the cardiologist in the morning...which we did. Kicker is when the cardiologist came in and looked at the tests he said it was slightly elevated, but nothing that he found alarming.\n\nAll in all I just felt like even though the ER was extremely slow, and at times there were 4 or more staff members sitting at the desk area within the ER, the overnight crew seemed fairly insufficient at simple things, like communicating that family members are there, or rehooking a patient back up to monitors and IV's.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec8f4e3dd0d69:0xabe5f655cd2e4f08"}

I only chose this awful hospital because BCBS will pay me $250 to have my gallbladder removed at this place and since I needed to have it removed why pass up $250. Like everyone else I did NOT have a pleasant stay.\n\nEverything and everyone seemed so unorganized and detached. I drove myself to the surgery and naturally they would not let me drive myself home so the supervisor contacted my surgeon and he ended up admitting me overnight due to nausea. After I came out of surgery I was given Norco and Morphine at the same time and then they transferred me to the fourth floor. They would not let me take my 50mg prednisone I have been on even though the anesthesiologist gave me permission to take it. I brought the medication with me and ended up taking it anyway.\n\nMy first nurse Linda was OK and she came in and told me she was there to give me percocet which I did not know the doctor wanted me to take but I took it anyway. That was around 530ish or 6pm. Hours later around 1130ish and it was wearing off my overnight nurse came in and I let her know I was ready for my morphine and norco and that I was ready to go to sleep. So she says OK I will give you the norco and it will take 30 mins to kick in and then you'll have to wait for the morphine. Fair enough even though I told her that's not how they administered it to me upstairs. Well 30 mins pass and she came back and I asked if I could have my morphine and she said no I can only give it to you every 2 or 3 hours. That was not what she said 30 mins prior so I said you mean I have to wait till 3am and she said yes. Ok 3am came and she comes and I asked again for my morphine. Mind you I was in severe pain and it hurt to move, get up, walk, etc. Basically felt like a chainsaw grinded my insides.\n\nAgain she refused to give me the morphine and said she could only give it to me every 4 hours. At that point I called her out on it and said that is not what you said and you said every 2-3 hours. She kept saying no she didn't say that and I said I remember your exact words and you said 2 or 3 hours and at 3am. She then looks up and says \"I might have said that\" and she said since I am being discharged with pain meds they don't like to give shots only pills. What??? What does my discharge meds have to do with meds the doctor specifically ordered for me to take in the hospital? So finally I said look what is the problem I just had surgery and I am in pain can you please give me my morphine. So she says OK, leaves for 2-3 mins, and comes back and says good news I can give you morphine or toradol. She proceeds to try and explain what toradol is and and I stopped her and said I know what toradol is and that is not what they have been giving me and is not what I asked you for. Can you please give me my morphine.\n\nShe finally says yes and goes to get it and when she comes back she seemed annoyed. That nurse Sharon Hendrix refused multiple times to give me the pain medication the doctor ordered for me. A nurse does not have that right or authority to go against doctor's wishes like that. I just had my gallbladder removed for crying out loud and this is how I was treated. Not only that but she even tried to get me to leave the hospital at 3am. She kept saying \"you know you are discharged and can leave anytime you want\". Mind you 3 hours prior she gave me a Norco which was still in my system so basically had I left it would be considered a DUI if I was pulled over. She automatically labeled me a drug seeker and deliberately denied me pain medication. This was a last minute surgery I had to have even though I did not want to.\n\nAlso if you page a nurse it takes them like 30 mins just to check on you and you'll have to page them twice. No one seems to know anything etc etc. I will NEVER go back to this place.\n\nI will be filing a complaint with the nursing board though I doubt they will do anything.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4f35d9f00e39:0xb97179d388354a4f"}

Upon arrival the waiting room was completely full so i knew it would be a wait which was expected and fine. I walked to the front desk and let her know that they had faxed over information that we were coming. She then told me she may have but they hadn't looked and i was looking at atleast an hour wait if not more. The way she kept talking was to try to discourage me from stay at waiting. I told her that was fine we would wait. After waiting a while we were called back to the area behind the front desk. They sat her on the bed, the doctor walked in said she was fine pretty much and walked out. They never brought her to a room or even gave her a bracelet as a patient. They told us to wait out front and they would discharge us. They brought us back again to get some info from me and discharged us then as we were leaving they called us back to the are because they realized they had not even checked her vitals, temperature or anything! They always told me they were understaffed and the doctor was frustrated and overwhelmed at how behind they were with all the patients and if she didn't feel better I COULD COME BACK LATER. Needless to say we left and i will not be paying any kind of bill i receive and i will be contacting them today. We drove an hour away to another hospital where we were taken right back. They did vitals, an exam, lab work, ct scan, and medication and are helping us with further testing.

Undoubtedly they're more worried about running off homeless people and harrassing family members who have no other choice than to rest in waiting rooms.Although this Hospital is cosmetically pleasing to look at,The service and  staff are not pleasing in any form.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d49ae48e6dfcb:0xf76b92ee40ce4da6"}

He asked me everything that was going on from the timeline to his symptoms. After listening to me, he assured me that I was on the right track with the colonoscopy.\n\nHe had every opportunity to schedule an appointment just because he could, as we were at such a vulnerable state. But he didn\u2019t, and I respect and appreciated that. I can tell that this doctor really cares about his patients, their care, their results, their well-being, and he loves what he does!\n\nIf you watch his video, what he says lines up with what he delivered to me over a simple phone call.

I was not given \"ANY SEDATION \" as I requested from the moment I arrived ahead of time until recovery staff ushered me out the back door. Initially I was given a  IV install and a nurse did provide a excellent medical evaluation of my health status and current medicines. Later, when I was  carted back for the nerve block in a very alert status, my doctor never advised  me of his presence. or his readiness to start. Within less than a minute from onset of the numbing injection, the larger needle was inserted that contains the medicine normally used for my type procedure. I was not under any sedation during this time and afterwards in the recovery room. In my 74 years on this good earth and a veteran of major operations, I have enough sense to know if I have received even the mildest form of sedation. After seeing my referring physician I told him about my patient experience at Spinecare.  I did not feel the standard of care was there at least in my case. I cannot in good conscious recommend Spinecare to anyone bases on my experience there but I am sure there are others that say \"Spinecare hung the moon\". Again, I feel it advisable not to be their last patient as I was closing time. This is the way I saw things there that particular day. I am sure they do good work regardless of my complaints.\nRobert W Maddox   2061 cross creek Drive   Tuscaloosa  35404", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1512286310169, "text": "Hi Robert, we appreciate your honest review.

I was also severely dehydrated needed intravenous hydration administered. The doctor there literally said, \"your bowels are dead, they arent working at all\". So she referred me to Hospital ER for further testing and treatment that she said they just werent equipt to do. They printed my blood test results and  xray results and gave me a copy to take to Doctor at ER. She told me she wouldnt be surprised if the admitted me.  So, being tired and not wanting to wait long hours in an ER waiting room, I decided NOT to go to Huntsville or Madison Hospital (where I should have gone) and went to one closer to my home in Marshall County. I had been to Marshall Med Center North for broken ribs a few years prior and they seemed to be ok so I figured, \"how much different could they be, they are all educated medical professionals right? \" They had a way shorter waiting time and at first everything seemed to be going as it should. I gave the girl who did my intake my urgent care paperwork and she asked if she could hold on to it for awhile. I said no problem cause of course the Doctor needed to see it. They put me in an er room and the doctor came in and told me that even though they had the urgent care results they were gonna start over and then if they saw the same thing they would do CT and further testing. He said I was dehydrated and the hooked me up to a bag of water to hydrate me while I waited. The xray girls came to me and took three xrays of me in one position with an xray machine that looked like it was older than me (I am 48) . After my bag of water ran out the doctor came in and informed me that he saw nothing on the xray but they found a UTI with cystosis and he believed I had viral gastroenteritis. He said they werent going to admit me and made me call a ride even though they had not administered any meds to me. He wrote me a rx for an antibiotic that specifically warns not to take if you are anemic and an anti nausea med. There was no mention of why my red blood count was so terribly low, or why I hadnt  urinated but maybe twice in a month or had a solid bm in over a month. I just feel like there is more to it than a virus. Anyway I asked the doctor for an excuse for two days from work and he said he would write me one. When I got to the pharmacy (my 80 year old neighbor came and got me) i realized there was no dr excuse and they hadnt given me my urgent care results back. Called them when I got home, talked to Heath  and he assured me he would have my paperwork and excuse waiting for me at front desk in morn. Got up early, drove back to hospital (18 miles away) and no paperwork or excuse to be found. So the girl comes out hands me a freshly written excuse for only one day (I was on my second day of missing work at that moment) and tells me they misplaced my urgent care paperwork (overnight) and apologized. I told her I could probably get a reprint from urgent care, not to worry about it. Been a week today and I have been urinating more but my other conditions havent changed. I hope it wasnt a total waste of time to go to mmcn.  Cause this doesnt seem to be over quite yet.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889e4aa54cd0ad9:0x39a6cadb8301dd8e"}

We have had some good experiences with them in the past, but the last  2 times have been very disappointing.  The first disappointment was over a year ago with my son who definitely had a concussion after a wreck he had. The care was non-existent.  They did not care.  That's a shame.  Well I decided to give them another chance with my husband yesterday.  He has early onset Alzheimer's and had a fall on our driveway.  I told them at arrival that he has Alzheimer's and I have power of attorney which I brought with me.  They didn't want my power of attorney.  I try to be discreet about his diagnosis as he is aware.  He prefers to call it a head injury or concussion. He gets extremely upset and depressed when the A word is connected to him.  Triage was fine.  The wait was non-existent.  The nurse and Dr talked to him.  He was not explaining the events correctly to them so I chimed in as is normal for us.  They kept looking at me like I'm crazy so I whispered he has Alzheimer's to the nurse.  Do these medical professionals not understand what that means?  There are varying stages of Alzheimer's but my husband's is mid to late.  He can't write, he can't drive and has not driven for almost 2 years,   he can't retell any event accurately,  he can't fix a sandwich,  there are so many things he can't do that he once did.  To look at him,  people say he looks normal.  His obsession is working out so he's fit.  I guess they thought I was crazy or controlling,  I don't know what they thought.  But they were rude.  I'm with him 24/7 as his caretaker. This would be like ignoring the mother of a child.  In his mind,  he is a child.  Anyhow I had to tell them many times he has Alzheimer's.  They just continued talking to him,  he kept looking to me.  His hand was covered in blood,  his head was bloody where he hit the driveway.  They did do a CT  scan,  I guess???  They did an x ray of his ribs.  They did not clean up his wounds to check the damage.  The nurse did put a steri strip on the brow/ temple cut but did not clean it first.  He put an antiseptic but I do believe cleaning the wound should have been the first step.  This wound later popped open with the swelling.  ( WE did ice it, but it did swell)  I cleaned his hand up and it appears to have debris embedded; nothing big but I could have used some help considering his mental condition and he is bigger than me.  I was mainly concerned about the head injury.  He hit his head on the concrete.... hello?!  That is how the biggest onset of symptoms began 2 years ago when he fell from our roof.  The doctor did not discuss the CT scan and walked off when I told him I had a question.  Not professional at all and highly upsetting to me as his caregiver.  I am responsible for him.  I need to know.  The nurse discussed discharge instructions with him, not me.  Not cool at all.   He has Alzheimer's, he is not going to remember.   I was upset,  they did not care.  I told them they were rude.  I have been married to this man for almost 29 years and his Alzheimer's caregiver for 2 years.  I was told congratulations and sorry I had a bad experience.  I don't appreciate the snarkiness.  It is disrespectful and highly unprofessional.  Are you not in the business of caring for people?   I really wanted to make sure his brain was not damaged.  I still don't know.  Maybe to them it doesn't matter,  I don't know.  He seems to be acting \"normal\" for him but I will have to get Marshall North to send records to his neurologist to get pace of mind.  I'm not going to give the names of the doctor or nurse but I do hope they exhibit more care with people on a regular basis and for heaven's sake,  clean up the wounds so they can be evaluated properly.

Only two of the many members of the staff had serious attitude problems, but my complaints were addressed properly when I stood up to them and went over their head. Some of the staff are great; and the rest are all pretty decent people. You have 2 nurses and 2 respiratory therapists in addition to a charge nurse taking care of up to 36 patients on any given shift. There are a few other assistants to suppliment them. On occasion I felt they were under staffed for the number of patients and the amount of attention each one needs. This becomes a big problem when a patient goes critical and requires a whole team. There really should be a doctor on the floor 24/7, but there is not. One of the more uncomfortable issues I had to deal with is how the doctor to patient-family relationship is non existent. A number of doctors take turns rotating and call themselves Hospitalists. You will barely get to know who they are unless you live there. They make their rounds; write the orders; and then disappear. I got the distinct feeling they want to have as little to do with the patients as they can get away with, but that is not just them. It appears to be the trend everywhere. Not to say the doctors will not do their best to address your questions and issues when you do get to see them, but I have to say I always felt like I was being hurried by them which makes it easy to get flustered into forgetting to mention, or ask something important. The most serious issue was the stage 4  bed sore my loved one contracted during his stay at Noland. They were not turning my loved one over, nor were they cleaning the wound everyday like they should have done. I did not realise how bad it was until it got infected and smelled up the whole floor. They tried to tell me the smell was normal. I don't think so. That was when I put my foot down, but by then the damage was done. Even after the doctor wrote orders to change the dressings every day they were missing days. The staff did not take care of the bed sore the way they should have. Best advice I can offer you is to have a family member pretty much live in the room with your loved one. They have a fold out bed and an easy chair to use for that purpose and it is allowed. That is the main reason I give it 3 star thumbs up rating. You will not get a 4-5 star facility unless you are wealthy and connected. Not sure there even is another choice in Montgomery besides Noland anyway.The cable TV service is adequate. The cafeteria is nice and the prices are not outragious, but they are not cheap either. It was a scary 50 day experience for me, but my loved one made it despite a few close calls. Two of them because my loved one was not restrained. If the staff says your loved one needs to be restrained LISTEN TO THEM. There is a very good reason for it. This place is serious business peeps. Your loved one would not be in this facility if their condition were not serious. Be vigilent and most importantly try to drop in to visit (inspect) your loved one at least two to three times a day if you can't arrange for someone to stay 24/7. I was only able to spend on average 5 hours a day total and I got myself pretty stressed out and exhausted coming and going. I am glad that I learned to interpret the important readouts on the monitors and looked at them often. Beware your loved ones CO2 level building up when they come off the ventalator and progress to the collar. Watch that oxygen concentration readout on the monitor. It may be your eyes that save their life by sounding the alarm and getting them back on the ventalator in time. Were it not for me arriving one day at just the right time my loved one very well may not have made it since the staff had dropped the ball and were oblivious to the seriousness of the emergency until I walked into the room and immediately sounded the alarm. I recall the night two patients passed away one after the other despite the staff's best efforts. Forget trying to get a staff member to come to your room when that is going down. Visting hours are 24/7.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81bcde2d7eb7:0x759b78f32b17049a"}

While I was in the ER a male nurse came in to put my foot into a boot and while I was screaming and pleading for him to stop he would not stop trying to forcefully shove my foot into the boot. When he finally finished I felt like my foot had been sprained all over again. After that I literally tried to roll myself out of that hospital in tears because I was in so much pain and I couldn\u2019t call my parents to get me out of there because my phone had died and they wouldn\u2019t let me call my parents from one of the hospital phones. After being left in the chair not able to leave the room because i couldn\u2019t open the door open for a while the guy finally came back in and rolled me out. We sat outside in the cold while I had to wait for another nurse to find my parents in the parking lot. By the time we left I was still crying in pain and just wanted to pass out. I am going to another doctors office to get more X-rays done and get more advice on what to do to help it heal because they didn\u2019t explain anything to me.
