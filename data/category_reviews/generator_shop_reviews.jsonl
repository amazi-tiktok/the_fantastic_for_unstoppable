They even wore shoe covers which I really appreciated. They arrived on time. They were did not take a break. They worked straight through the entire job. It was fantastic to see that they worked every minute until the finish the entire job.\n\nMy dad was super please. They gave us a great price and cleanup all the debris when they were done. The service was excellent. Timely and professional. In future, this is the only electrical company, I would contact. Everything we asked from our estimate was completed and was excellent. We were more than pleased with the efforts and performance of the two electricians as well as the final results.\nWe have been extremely satisfied with the cost and results.

As you all know, many businesses won't even take the time to contact a lost customer.  Marc not only reached out but followed up with us to confirm we were taken care of, even though we had to pull our truck.  He made no excuses and stated that the communication errors were taken seriously and will be addressed.  Ultimately our repair had to been completed elsewhere but Williams still followed up and showed accountability.  I would be comfortable continuing to use W.W. Williams as I have at various locations.  However, I would advise that you seek assistance from Management if communication is lacking.  I wish we had done so sooner.\n\nBe aware that every experience isn't the same.  We had a truck towed in to this location due to the good reviews and communication with the tech on our call.  We were told that our truck would be looked at first thing the following day.  Day 1, truck not looked at, we were told someone went home sick.  This was after we called to get an update.  We were told it would be looked at the following a.m.\nDay 2,  I we provided the potential location of the issue after speaking with our home mechanic.  We asked how pics could be sent to get things rolling.  We emailed a pic of the part and diagnostic which was from a recent repair of another unit with the same problem.  We followed back up after not hearing anything mid day.  The truck was not looked at by mid-day we were told this time 2 people were out.\nDay 3, Calls and face to face contact again resulted in no action, the truck was not looked at.\nDay 4, We went to location to try to nail down a realistic expectation of when the truck would be touched.  We were told they would try by late afternoon but could not say for sure, this came from advisement with the shop supervisor.\n\nThis has been the worst experience we have had with a WW Williams which we use often locally.  Our confidence in towing the truck was due to the quality of work and professionalism we experienced in the past.  This location has not met the standard exemplified by the WW Williams name.  Truitt has not followed up with us nor provided a realistic time table to address the misinformation provided prior to the town in.  We understand staff issues occur, especially in the current pandemic climate.  However, there is no excuse for not providing updates nor treating all customers with the same level of priority.  The business is open, there are technicians present, and trucks being worked on.  Yet, we have not been serviced nor updated with an expected diagnostic date.  The cost of being out of service has been extended due to the poor service standard.  Beware before taking your truck here.  Sitting and no communication is not a reasonable expectation and very costly in trucking.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610485566188, "text": "Thank you so much for updating this and we do hope that we can do better for you in the future!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888e82757537d6dd:0x704f734fd94a65f7"}

AAA got us in touch with W. W. Williams. I described our problem over the phone to W. W. Williams. The front seal was leaking badly, our transmission was functioning normally as long as it had fluid in it, however was leaking too rapidly to drive. The mechanic on call nearly insisted that he come out and have a look at it on site, however I told him there was nothing that could be done on the side of the road. We decided we would spend the night on the side of the road and have it towed to W. W. Williams the next day.\n\nThe next day we had the RV towed to W. W. Williams. The mechanic on call insisted that we let him come out and put the RV inside the gates, even though we were not worried about it as it was a very industrial area. The mechanic came out and was nice and spent about 10 minutes installing the driveshaft since it had been removed by the towing company. We again explained and showed him the problem and he assured us that it would be no big deal for them to repair. The shop was very nice and appeared to be well equipped. The mechanic estimated 8-10 hours labor for the repair. He waited another 20 minutes for our ride home to arrive and we left.\n\nA few days later W. W. Williams called to say that they could not repair our RV. They said that since it was leaking from the front seal, they wouldn't have the tooling. They charged $600 to tell us this, which is very upsetting because I told them that was what the problem was from square one and several more times after that. They justified their price by a minimum 4 hour charge for the guy to meet us to put it behind the gate, and then a inspection fee on top of that to glance underneath the camper. Their seasoned mechanic should have been able to make that call right away, and charging for an inspection is ridiculous as this could and should have been done by the mechanic while we were paying for his 4hr service call, he had plenty of time for that as he was with us for an hour or less. The tooling is also a very lame excuse.\n\nThis company clearly took advantage of us, and figured they could make an easy profit without having to touch our RV. Life is expensive enough as it is, we don't need to gouge each other. I am really upset that I told them our problem from the very beginning and they still put us through all of this.\ncall right awaycl", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e82757537d6dd:0x704f734fd94a65f7"}

We are so very happy with our overall experience with this company. In fact (no lie) less than two hours after the final hook-up, there was a sudden storm, the electricity went out and the generator came on. It was seamless!!! We did have a misunderstanding with the salesman but once we brought it to the attention of Steve Dukes, the business owner, he quickly and decisively took care of it. Because we are on the Bay, we wanted the generator elevated so that, should there be flooding, the generator would be safe. That request hadn't been conveyed to the installers. However, when Mr. Dukes was made aware of the oversight, he actually constructed a metal stand for us himself. Plus he did this very quickly so that the delay was minimal. We were thinking they would build us a wooden platform, but the metal one is much better \u2014 both functionally (as it will last longer) and aesthetically. We are from Michigan and we had no intention of being here through hurricane season but we had traveled here with my 94 year old mother and, because of the coronavirus, she couldn\u2019t fly back and she can\u2019t physically tolerate such a long drive.  I was afraid that, because of the misunderstanding, we would be relegated to the bottom of the list and have to wait until they could \u201cget around to it\u201d because they were so busy...not so! There was only a slight delay while the frame was fabricated. So, fast forward to the present time: We had \u201cbugged out\u201d when Hurricane Sally was about 100 miles South of us and just now walked into the door after Sally had passed through. There is no electricity on either side of us but we walked into the door with the generator humming reassuringly beside the house. I don\u2019t have to worry about Moms Bi-Pap or oxygen condenser working. She will be able to sleep comfortably tonight...and so will I. Mr. Dukes made sure we had the generator installed the way we wanted it and in a timely manner, smoothing out the bumps along the way. I definitely recommend getting a whole house (Generac) generator and I highly recommend doing business with Mr. Dukes of Baldwin Heating & Air Conditioning.

So we called Baldwin HVAC.  They sent a guy to come out and look at it.  He looked briefly at the unit, walked around the house for a few minutes with a thermometer, and quickly pronounced that there was nothing wrong, and that all we needed was to change our air filters.  So they charged us $39 for the visit (the fee they quote you) plus $50 for \"labor,\" which I guess is that guy's rate for walking around your house for 10 minutes.\n\nObviously, I keep my filters changed, so I was suspicious, but I assumed that he knew what he was talking about.  2 weeks ago, our AC stops working completely.   Before calling anyone, I go into the attic and check it out myself.  The coils were completely frozen.  And not only that - they were clogged with dust and mold.  This was due to our blower motor malfunctioning, which had been happening slowly for some time at that point.\n\nI took a photo to show how bad it was.  Naturally, I called Baldwin HVAC to ask how their guy missed something so obvious.  The manager, Anthony, said that the initial $89 visit \"didn't include\" looking at the coils, even though it took me - an ordinary guy with no HVAC expertise - literally 5 minutes to open up the blower and look in there.\n\nLike an fool, I believed him, and so hired them to come out and fix the blower motor that had gone bad.  Their guy John came and he was nice and did a good job.\n\nBut the next day, the same AC unit goes dead again.  This time, the problem is the outdoor compressor.  So I call them to come check it out.\n\nThey charge us yet another $89 to come and look at the same AC system they'd worked on the very day before.  This time, we resist their high-pressure sales tactics (\"It's 4 PM, so if you want the AC working tomorrow, we need to order the part now! \") and call a different company to work on the compressor.  Baldwin HVAC quoted us $822 to replace the part (which was covered by warranty).  We went to Climatemp instead, and they charged us $550 for the exact same job.  They got the part that same day and had a guy out there the very next morning.\n\nLong story short: I'd recommend someone else first, if only because these people charge more than other companies, and in my experience, the quality of the work just wasn't sufficient to justify the extra cost.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a69f62d949da1:0x9a9bd9e00f87db88"}

I said this is a brand new unit why would a part fail in one day. They said they have been having this problem with the trane units the sales man Dan never told us that while he was selling us the unit. On top of all of this it took a week to get us the part from Trane to fix my brand new unit. Evidently Trane has a problem there brand new units quit working before they ever even get started and you can't get parts for them in a timely manner. We will never buy another Trane!!!

I am very happy with their work. They took the step of identifying that the original pvc piping used for the drain for the unit in the attic was not draining effectively (a worker in the attic poured a gallon of water into it while another worker in the garage observed and noted the water did not make it to the drain in the garage) and they corrected that, mounting fasteners in multiple places along the PVC pipe to ensure it sloped properly in its run across the attic, and they replaced the rusted overflow tray beneath the HVAC unit. They also eliminated the traps in the drains for both units, which is where algae would always build up; the traps were apparently redundant because both drains feed into a drain in the garage floor that has a trap beneath the concrete floor. They left straight cleanouts in place of the p-traps which should reduce algae buildup, and I can still pour vinegar or chlorine to reduce algae. The three workers, Bobby, Jason, and Matt seemed trustworthy and very competent.

They arrived, placed a pad and installed the generator.  The guy who seemed to be in charge said that they had checked the generator and it was good to go.  My wife and I discovered that the green light, indicating that the generator was functional, was not on.  A red light was on.  This was at 11:30pm at night.  It wasn't running or doing anything weird, so I called the Generac corp. office and a man there told me how to turn the generator off.  I did such and the next day, I called CES to inform them of the problem.  I had to tell my story to three different people.  THEN they said that the owner would have to talk to me to get an 'OK' for a service call.(?)  So, I called him and he proceeded to criticize how I had handled the situation.  I didn't want to call someone out in the middle of the night for, what appeared to be a non emergency problem.  He finally okayed a tech to come out.  The tech could not find anything wrong after a 'thorough and complete' exam.\nAbout 10 days later, my wife and I were out in the yard and we heard a very loud clang sound.  Repeatedly , a harsh noise seemed to be coming from the transfer switch that goes  to the generator.   We called CES and had to tell our story to three people again and, as it was 4:30pm, we finally were referred to \"Buddie\", who said that everyone had gone home for the day.  This was their response to what sounded like a very damaging situation occurring.  I demanded to talk to the owner.  He called again and criticized me again for how I had handled the situation.  He also was abusive about how I had spoken to his employees.  The best defense is, apparently, still a good offense.  So, I went on defense reflexively.  I just wanted the machine to be fixed.  He said that it was the Huntsville Utilities problem.  He said, reluctantly, that he would call back a tech who lived in Guntersville to make a service call.  I called HU and they had no complaints of outages.  I also checked with both neighbors, who had no problem.  At this  point, the HU tech came out and he said that everything on the electrical service was in good working order.  The technician from CES arrived and examined the generator. He said that he had never seen anything like this problem before.  GREAT!!   So, he increased the idle time between my service going out and the generator startup. His parting words were that he would call Generac and find out what the problem was and would call me.  RIGHT!!   At this juncture I had had enough of CES and I transferred my warranty to Mr. Electric.  Days later the same scenario occurred with harsh clashing sounds coming from the transfer switch.   I called Mr. Electric and one person handled the problem and sent out a service tech.  He discovered that two color-coded wires had been installed to the wrong color-coded positions, rendering the machine sensing low wattage coming into my house from HU.  He took pictures of the situation and re installed the correct color wire to the correct color position and the problem was solved.  He asked if the CES techs had performed a post installation check on the generator, because this incorrect wiring pattern would have been discovered if CES had done a post installation check.  I told him that the CES guy told me that they had done the check up.  EVIDENTLY NOT!!!  He showed me the reading on the machine with the crossed wires was stimulating the generator to turn on.  The wattage read on the LED was low.  He fixed this problem and looked the entire installation over.  I have to give at least one star to CES in order to get this posted, so  one star to CES for having a pulse.  Five stars to Mr. Electric.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88627356036de3a3:0xcf111e024483c90c"}
