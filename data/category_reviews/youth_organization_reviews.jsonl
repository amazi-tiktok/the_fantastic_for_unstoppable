My son had ymca learning program at this time for online class due to c19. Last week was horrible. I sent zoom meeting information with teacher email on Tue which is saying that she would need class in zoom meeting at first week. Manager replied she needs schoology log in info. I had to reply again on Wed morning that my son needed to attend zoom meeting instead of schoology. But he missed Wed. I sent email again that let him attend on Thur & Fri finally. On Thur, my son missed again. So during meeting, I called manager to check it out. She did not know it. Finally on Fri. my son attended fully. So my son was not happy and comfortable with YMCA service. Me neither. Without care, I paid $120 each week. My son told me his elder sister could help him instead of YMCA. So this week Mon, as soon as my son dropped in YMCA, I sent email to manager that I need to cancel. She replied she saw my son and asked me about changing my mind. I replied immediately that I would want to cancel asap your confirmation. She replied at 11oclock that she cancelled from next week. So I called her and asked her that I wanted to cancel this week and get refund. She said that even one day attendance would change all week payment. So she won't give refund no matter one day attendance of my son. It does not make sense at all. YMCA is very greedy. Even I sent her email at 8clock at Monday morning. I sent email to manager and cc to director. But the same reply. Very greedy. I am still very mad at this.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b9e17217137:0xcaa6c459c1c9784"}

Our counselor should have ensured that your daughter was delivered to her soccer coach, and she was not. After reviewing our security camera footage, we did find that when your daughter was walked to the soccer field, the Southeast YMCA Sports Support Staff Member was present and other children were engaged with their coaches in soccer practice at that time (4:59 p.m.), but your daughter's coach was not present. At 5:03 p.m., a counselor walked your daughter back inside to her Afterschool group. At no time during this footage did we observe counselors or sports staff on their cell phones. We have taken appropriate action with the counselor involved and are reviewing our policies and procedures with all Afterschool staff to ensure that this does not happen again. We look forward to seeing your daughter again today for Afterschool care and thank you for allowing us to continue to serve your family.

We've always liked the private swimming lessons experience and those instructors have always been excellent. We used to love the Kids Night Out program, but they've made it less conducive for our child who is not into socializing. I wish they had some kind of classes for beginners especially yoga. Administrative people are nice but don't seem to be on the same page with information. Cleaning attendants are friendly and always hard at work. Now that my children are 8 and 11 they do not feel comfortable going in the ladies dressing room which I totally agree with but I do not feel comfortable letting them go in the men's area because there is no privacy for them. I'm not comfortable with them being exposed to naked men or having to expose themselves. Probably a lot to ask for a kids dressing area or family room. There is a changing room/storage room by the pool but I think it's really just meant for storage. It would be great if they would post the status of the pool on Facebook or via text.
