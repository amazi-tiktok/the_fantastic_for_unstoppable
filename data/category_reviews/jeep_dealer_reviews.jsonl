Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people.

This was very shabby business as it was fine before the work was done.

The service rep who took care of me made the scheduling and check-in nice and easy and arranged for the shuttle service to take me home. I was disappointed that the AutoNation website didn't allow me to schedule an appointment for repairs online (only maintenance services could be done online). I got a diagnosis and repair quote within a day, but word that it would take a week to get the part in. It turned out to be an additional day for the part to arrive, and I was told the car would be done the following day, but  it took two more days for it to get done. We came from the Houston area where we were used to parts being accessible more quickly, so this wait time may be normal for the Mobile area. The pickup experience was a bit frustrating. I picked up on a Saturday and waited 1 hour 15 minutes to get checked out (was told the car was ready but paperwork had to be done). The service rep kept getting pulled away by walk-ins, phone calls, and I'm not sure what else, but it seemed I kept getting bumped to the back of the line. There may have been more legitimate reasons for the long wait time, but those weren't shared with me.
