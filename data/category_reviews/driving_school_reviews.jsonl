They tell you that you can get your CDL in 15 days, I guess that\u2019s possible if you pay an extra $150 to take you're test early. Most of the people I know of took about 6 weeks to get their CDL. They do tell you that they will help get you a job and that\u2019s part of what your paying them for, well I guess they do but the help is faxing an application, the same application you could fill out online. Overall a few of the trainers are good, however a few good trainers can only get you so far when the equipment doesn\u2019t work right.

The facilities are absolutely first rate, the cars are simply spectacular and the instruction and seat time that you experience are second to none.  Barber Motorsports Park is a spectacular facility and after a relatively short but very informative classroom session, they take you to the track, show you the flow of the 2.38 mile 16 corner course and have you driving at speed in what seemed to be no time at all.  They split you up in separate groups, some going to the track while others run very helpful and fun exercises, including a diabolical skid pad and high-speed autocross where you get the feel of just how far you can push the car before it breaks away.  As I think back on it, I\u2019m still amazed at how much seat time you get on the track  while experiencing the other exercises including a short off-road deep-woods session in the Porsche Cayenne\u2019s.   The cars are exquisitely maintained and you are invited to drive almost everything in the fleet, including the amazing Porsche 911Turbo S.  Driving hard lap after lap and never once did I get even the slightest hint of brake fade.   Following a brief heel and toe shifting lesson you can also lap  the track in 911\u2019s equipped with manual transmissions - the purists loved that.  They also rotate the instructors so you get some experience and information from their entire line of true professionals.\nIn my opinion, bang for the buck, there is no better Experience to be had if driving fast in a safe, beautiful  environment is what you\u2019re looking for. The accommodations, hotel, food  and of course the vehicles are all world class.  Porsche along with Jeff Purner and Cass Whitehead have set the bar high for any other driving experience to try and come close.   The hot laps at the end along with the tour of the most spectacular motorcycle and Lotus museum in the world is like sensory overload. I enjoyed every moment of them.  If you don\u2019t already drive a Porsche, I could almost guarantee that after this experience you will be shopping for one. For those that don\u2019t have a fair amount of track time, try and find some or possibly take the one day course first because when you arrive for the two day performance course it is definitely \u201cGame On\u201d!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888912dd9f25760b:0xebc0f09147b1bf99"}

Basically, in the \"beginner\" course, you get four opportunities to drive around their track. They separate you into groups, and it's luck of the draw.

First off; I received my first speeding ticket and I needed to sign up for traffic school. I called with no idea of how ASI or traffic school worked and asked if they had any Saturday classes; they did. I work all day Friday's so the Saturday 8 am class was perfect. After I arrived there and the gentleman in the class called the names out, I realized my name wasn't called. When I asked him about this he was very kind and told me to come pick up my certificate of completion first thing Monday. I was confused, but I assumed it was a simple error. When I went up there Monday and explained what happened, the two kind ladies at the front went to their \"supervisor\" or whatever in a desk behind the glass in the front. I could see everything that was being said and her facial expressions. She walks out there and says \"Um, you were signed up for Friday at 9am and you missed that class.\" I was shocked at this time. I explained to her that's impossible, because I had no idea they had a Friday class and that I was told Saturday at 8 am, how would I know to show up at that time Saturday if that is not what I was told? She rudely scoffed and rolled her eyes and told me it was my mistake and that there was a missed class fee. I refused because this was NOT my error. She eventually walked back there slamming stuff around and basically shoved my certificate to me. Now the two ladies at the front were quiet at this time, and were very kind when I left. However, that other wicked witch was the complete opposite. It was clearly their mistake, and she stood there trying to make me feel like an idiot and trying to force me to pay a missed class fee that I really did not miss. Her lack of common knowledge and grammar was quite frightening, and next time I'll just pay the ticket to avoid that lady.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d9ac65230a7:0x8c8c3cbeffbbc2e4"}
