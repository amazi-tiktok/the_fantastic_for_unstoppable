Refs are great and freindly. However, they never chrono.(checking the FPS of the guns brought from outside the field)And the whole, \"it's airsoft if you can't take being shot don't play\" is not an acceptable excuse for a CQB(close quarters combat)field especially when they majority of players on the field are little kids. Typical fields have allow for rifles to be set at a max of 350fps which would hardly ever break skin, unless at a close distance and again if not checked can be dangerous for all players young or old because someone can run 400-500fps and not be held accountable for the damage. Also the refs have good intentions when it comes to trying to make new game modes but when these new game modes are not well thought out you are often left on the field playing classic TDM (team death match) towards the end of the round. Also it seems that there is not much commintcation/training between upper management and staff often leaving things to be unorganized. On a more positive side of things most of the refs there have extensive knowledge of airsoft guns and equipment meaning that repairs can often be made on site and they are always willing to give a helping hand.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509254832788, "text": "Every single gun that enters our field is chronoed before it is allowed to be used, any gun that is reported to be too hot is rechronoed. If someone is hiding a gun and is shooting too hot they will be ejected from the field. If you feel a gun is shooting too hot have the ref or anyone on the staff chrono the gun just to make sure.\n\nOur chrono limit is 380 FPS for all guns on field, we do allow 400 during times where the entire group wishes to play at the higher FPS. All of this is covered in our rules as well as enforced by our staff. If we suspect anyone is using a gun that has not been chronoed we take care of it by either rechronoing the gun or removing the offending player from the field.\n\nNew game modes at indoor fields almost always devolve into TDM regardless of how the game mode is setup, we do welcome any suggestions as to new game modes you might wish to play.\n\nAs for the comment on the communication piece, please email us at battlegroundsairsoftbham@gmail.com with an example of how the staff is not communicated with and trained in how to run the field as I ,the owner, speak to them not less than 5 to 10 times daily to ensure everything is operating smoothly, I have two managers on site who run the field every single day, and the remaining staff have been playing and reffing airsoft games, as well as organizing larger airsoft events for a combined 20+ years.

Took my son and his friend for the first time.  Pricing I thought was fair ($35 for gun and mask rental for all you can play).  Staff and experienced players very helpful and friendly.  Arena is pretty cool with all kinds of obstacles to hide behind.  Showroom area is OK and only had a selection of three of four rifles to purchase, but the pricing on what was in stock is comparable to what you would find online.\n\nNow for the not so good part of the experience.  Groups were too large for only one referee. In general the experienced players were fair but a majority of the time we got lit up after calling we had been hit.  They are supposed to have a 350 fps limit but not once did I see any guns checked with a chronograph.  Makes me wonder just how fair game play actually is.  I can handle an occasional curse word but the  language from the younger players was out of control.\n\nWith that being said, the management was quick to fix problems brought to them about excessive gaming, horse play and bad language.  All in all not a terrible experience but a lot of room for improvement and to make this a much more enjoyable experience from the novice to the veteran player.\n\nSo the real question now is, \"Would you go back?\".  My answer is, \"Maybe\".    If I was to go with a group, rent a time slot and have a more controlled environment then my answer is,  \"Absolutely!\".\n\nThis is not to slam Battlegrounds Airsoft, but to give a fair critique in hopes to see it live up to it's true potential.  To have a great environment so that a new person coming to the sport would have a great experience and want to return again and again.  Hope this helps.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJames Johnson", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888911bac08b7839:0xe44d70c37c4c3d8"}
