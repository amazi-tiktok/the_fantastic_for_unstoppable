I went to pick it up and it was over $80 - WHAT!!!  So I wasn't giving a $80 cake away. We went to Publix and gave that cake away. So we decided for $80 this had better be the best cake of our lives. We invited family over for dinner and we all dug in.  Well the chocolate cake was moist but the Salted caramel and the icing was not good.  NO ONE finished their slice.  For $80 we should've cleaned our plates and been asking for seconds.  My MIL didn't even want to take the extra home.  So disappointed.  My wedding cake didn't even work out to cost that much.

More recently, I entrusted Mrs. Sandra and her team with my wedding cake. My cake was everything that I could have ever wanted. And it was delicious the two little bites I had. My guest thoroughly enjoyed the cake as well. The customer service was impeccable , I now live out of town and the handled all of my request over the phone. They were so kind an warm. My family and I will always continue to use Cake Designs. Thank you for the Wedding Cake of my Dreams!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a93e3b225f7:0x6424a7bc0def1568"}

Me trying to be a good husband, she told me that she would like to try so I immediately told her let's do it. We called to make our order and were both very happy with the customer service and ease of the process and selection on short notice. We were on the circle across town so we made it there in just a few minutes. I went inside and was greeted in the most cozy, comfy place I had ever been in Dothan by a very sweet, kind lady(wish I had gotten her name so I could thank her on here but too late now, thank you for you're awesome service). Our order was already prepared that quickly but the case had items my wife didn't mention so risking getting in trouble (lol not really but husband's will understand) I asked if I could add a few items and without hesitation she was ready to help me. She packaged it up, gave me a total, I paid, and left it was a wonderful all around experience. This was the simplest part of this review lol. Skip forward a few hours, we are home and have had dinner and my wife is ready to try out the cupcakes. We both had a red velvet cupcake first and we had to stop what we were doing and thinking about to take in the experience that was happening. I can not explain in words how perfect they were, texture, smell and the taste... OMG, hands down the best red velvet anything that I've ever had my entire life (I'm 33), we then had to try another one so we each tried a different one so we could taste more without eating too much and still try more because we are still both in shock of the amazing thing happening. I got a key lime cupcake and she got a birthday cake cupcake, again we both were blown away by how incredible this all was. She is actually rushing me now because I had to stop then and write this review to let anyone know, who has a sweet tooth or any reason to get a treat, this is the place to go. We will go back in future and tell everyone we know to go try it because it is that great of an all around experience start to finish. Thank you so much and we look forward to the next time.\n\nUpdate to the review, this is the next day and my wife has started negotiating terms of the last cupcake because they are that amazing.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890458fdc68ebeb:0x1bcdce01641345de"}
