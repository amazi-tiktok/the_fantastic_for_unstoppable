I specifically chose an upper end cabinet company because I wanted everything done correctly the first time, but that is not the kind of quality WF keeps. In short, save yourself the money and go with Lowe's, kitchen remodels will be painful either way.\n\nThe long story.\n\nWe put in our order months early because we knew there had been issues getting wood due to COVID. They arrived about when their ETA said it would, however one of the particularly custom cabinets was delayed because it was rejected by quality control. The contractor was able to install the rest of the cabinets while we waited, then installed the custom one as soon as it arrived, only to realize it's a completely different color than the rest of our cabinets.\n\nHere's a summary of the issues:\na) Miscoloration on the tall cabinet\nb) Miscoloration on the island cabinet\nc) Miscoloration on the basecovers\nd) Missing the base on one of the drink bar cabinets\ne) Missing the sink front tray\nf) Crack in the upper drink bar cabinet\ng) Misalignment of closed door on upper cabinet\n\nI mentioned these issues to my sales rep who had a representative from WF come to inspect the issues. They showed up an hour earlier than they said they would, which meant that I was running a meeting instead of being able to have a discussion about appropriate fixes for the multitude of issues. After I already stated that I don't normally WFH and had made sure to clear my schedule for the time they arranged it was extremely unprofessional to show up early and then leave before we could go over the issues and fixes together. To be clear, I would have much rather gotten a refund then waiting 6 weeks for new ones, but that possibility was not discussed because the sales person left without talking to me.\n\nAfter insisting on a itemized list of issues with fixes this was the result:\na) Miscoloration on the tall cabinet - new one would be sent\nb) Miscoloration on the island cabinet - covered by decorative panel\nc) Miscoloration on the basecovers - new basecover sent\nd) Missing the base on one of the drink bar cabinets - paid my contractor to make the base instead of building and sending a new cabinet\ne) Missing the sink front tray - new sink tray sent\nf) Crack in the upper drink bar cabinet - not integral to stability and covered by decorative panel\ng) Misalignment of closed door on upper cabinet - new door to be sent\n\nSo, 6 weeks later, the new tall cabinet, basecover, cabinet door, and sink tray to find the following issues. (Anything not mentioned was fine.)\n\na) Tall cabinet was still the wrong color\ne) Sink tray arrived broken\ng) New cabinet door was the wrong color and wrong size, it doesn't fit any cabinet in my kitchen\n\nAt this point I told my sales rep I wanted a refund for the affected items and was otherwise done with this endeavor. I cook in my kitchen every day, I'd already delayed finishing my kitchen for an extra six weeks due to delays from these cabinets and I was not going to delay finishing the kitchen for any longer.\n\nShe said she would contact the WF rep to see about the refund. I followed up two weeks later only to find out that someone put in a new order for another replacement. We had to get that cancelled and after four more weeks we got the refund.

The maple cabinets (painted arctic white) look good, but they don't work well, at all. I am very, very disappointed.  After having Kraftmaid cabinets at our house in Florida, I was hoping for the same quality.  Nope.  They can't compare to Kraftmaid. If I had known, I would have paid the extra to get much, much better quality.  The lower, large pantry doors came with several dings and scratches. At least 5 of the cabinet drawers had gouges and large indentations, and the doors above the fridge had several dings.  To top it all off, the slow close hardware stinks.  Nothing glides like it should.  The Kraftmaid would just glide beautifully after you gently pushed the drawers. The Wellborn Forest cabinets wiggle as soon as you push them gently, and they hardly move. You have to push the drawers up to the point where the slow close mechanism takes over, which is basically pushing them shut yourself.  That's just unacceptable. Even though they cost less than Kraftmaid, they still were not cheap.  I insisted on American made cabinets and this is what I get.  As I said before, I am very, very disappointed. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting a better American made product, certainly not Wellborn Forest.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0c85c8b3e945:0xec973abb4d7a1eab"}

There aren\u2019t strong enough words to describe the level of frustration and anger I feel toward this company. We began our kitchen renovation in October 2017 and now it\u2019s  January 2019 and cabinets are still arriving in the wrong paint color, poorly packaged (and subsequently damaged), and the paint job is inconsistent and chipping. I've been living with the wrong vent hood for over a year, and faulty paint issues (admitted by WB) that caused paint to flake off of these cabinets from day 1. Even worse, the cabinets are all varying shades of white so they don't match. It is very clear there is no QC process in place given the state of my vent hood that had arrived damaged or the wrong size/style and color all together more than 5 or 6 times now. We continually receive wrong items - such as the completely wrong drawer faces, dishwasher panels, and even after this has been escalated to customer service and the VP of ops multiple times. This has gone on for so long now that it originally delayed our project - even with them knowing the project was being filmed by HGTV - and we couldn't even finish off our kitchen for a few additional months as we waited for product. It\u2019s almost as though they skipped a paint coat on these cabinets and sent them out the door as though acceptable. A few cleanings (without chemicals) later and paint rubs right off! Many had flakes of paint missing upon arrival and still need replaced. We have renovated multiple homes and this is our third kitchen install, yet the most challenging company we\u2019ve ever been forced to work with. We had better longevity and less issues when we used Lowe\u2019s cabinets on our first flip home. Shame on this company for all of the money they\u2019ve cost in labor and heartache along the way, for a lack of compensation as a result, and for STILL not getting it right more than a year later. I would never recommend them. For the $20k we spent on cabinets we absolutely could have gotten a much better product elsewhere that would look better and last longer without all this heartburn.\n\nUpdate: It's been 2 weeks since I originally wrote this review, and even with getting the rep involved, my cabinet hood arrived yet again with a large paint gouge, it arrived in a semi-gloss rather than the satin, and it was the wrong hood all together. This is the 4th hood, and just one example. It's endless.\n\nUpdate again: We've received 2 more hoods - same issues. Still not done. I still have mis-matched white colored cabinets, and flaking paint because the paint wasn't applied properly. My next step is to report this company to the BBB for not following through with the product I paid for after admitting faulty paint issues and sending wrong items (vent hood). I want a refund.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0c85c8b3e945:0xec973abb4d7a1eab"}

I ordered one piece of granite for a 84\" bathroom vanity. I ordered a remanent off of a slab there. I paid a 50% deposit and they were holding it for me. When it was time to be installed, they brought it for my vanity. Unfortunately they installed a piece that was not mine. I paid the balance of this in November and I wasn't ready for it until April. When I went by the shop to pick up a small piece for the shower, I was advised I still owed the other 50% as they didn't show it paid for.. Thank goodness I had a canceled check to prove I had paid for it. I contacted them and advised they had installed the wrong one.  They said they would call the owner, they have never gotten back to me with any kind of explanation at all.  It is installed with no explanation and no apology. Now it would cost me an extra fortune because I am not living in the house and the plumbers installed all the plumbing which would be another added expense to have it replumbed. An apology would have been nice, or they didn't have enough remanent left, or some kind of an explanation and give me another choice. I had no choice in the matter.  No I would not recommend them for any stone work.  After over 1100.00 for 84 inches, we sent them pictures of what we bought and what we had.  The only contact I have had since was they sent me the warranty with still no explanation whatsoever.   I have never been so disappointed in a company and I will never do business with them again. So my situation is this: live with it for the rest of my life or have a law suit and have the bathroom torn up again which has not even been offered..

We are going on FIVE MONTHS and our project still isn\u2019t complete. My husband and I built our home and our entire project was held up for several weeks because of cabinets. Communication is awful. The guy we have been dealing with takes days if not weeks to respond to any emails or phone calls. The wrong color was ordered for our pulls even though we confirmed THREE times on what colors we wanted. And on top of that they didn\u2019t even order the entire amount of pulls we needed so we still have cabinets with no pulls. We have mismatched pulls in our master bathroom because, again, they failed to order the correct color or number of pulls. But my biggest complaint is that they installed our cabinets for the wrong size oven so we then had to return the oven we already had ready to be installed and buy a bigger one which ended up costing us $5,000 to fix their mistake. We have a vanity cabinet in our master bath that is the WRONG COLOR and instead of fixing it themselves they dropped off a can of spray paint for us to fix it. The fact that they are willing to let a customer fix their mistake is beyond me. We even recommended this company to other people (before all of the mistakes) and after talking to our friends we find out that their cabinets were messed up as well!

In June I was given the phone number for a Legacy representative by the builder's superintendent of the subdivision so that I could order a drawer kit.  On June 15th I call Tim (sorry I do not have his last name) with Legacy.  He gave me the name and phone number of a person in Florida that would place my order.  On June 16th I placed the order and was told it would take 2 to 3 weeks for the kit to come in.  She took all my contact information, name, phone number, email and street address.  The charge went through on my credit card on June 26th.  After 5 weeks (on July 24th) with no word from Legacy I began trying to get in touch with the person that took my order.  During the next week I call 4 times and left 2 voice messages with no results.  At this point I gave up on her and started calling Tim.  On July 27th, I called Tim, explained that I was unable to contact the person I placed the order with and could he help me.  He told me she had been fired, he had been on vacation, was extremely busy but would look into it.  Tim actually called me back about an hour later and said that it appeared the kit was in the warehouse and that he would look for it after lunch.  I did not hear back from him.  On the 28th I tried to call but he did not answer.  On July 30th I called again and Tim told me he had a guy looking for it, that the warehouse is very large.  On July 31st again I called and Tim did not answer.  On August 4th I called Tim and asked if we could get some closure on this transaction.  Tim did not yell at me but raised his voice to give me numerous excuses.  The warehouse is big, they had to fire an employee, another employee was out sick, this is their busy time of year and his last excuse made my jaw drop.  He then told me that this was not his job but he would keep looking in the warehouse at which point I suggested maybe he could order another kit.  He said he could do that but would continue to look in the warehouse.  I have not heard from him since the 4th so am assuming that he has not found the original kit and hoping he has ordered a replacement.\n\nI realize that Legacy Cabinets does not make much if any profit from the sale of one drawer kit.  I understand that the builders that purchase cabinets for multiple houses is where Legacy makes the profits but the rudeness and lack of professionalism has absolutely been uncalled for.  I could have never imagined that ordering one drawer kit could be so difficult.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597347653482, "text": "Monique, the final response you described is certainly not the amazing service that we're known for.

Kitchen cabinet doors have issues with noisy doors, etc..Had a company rep here from Legacy with the local support company, answers given by Legacy Rep. contradict each other. Sort of dismissing the company from a bad product line.\nVariety of options here are 3 of them.\n\n1. One answer was \u201cWE\u201d could install soft close door hinges, but they can\u2019t, because the cabinet was not designed or sold with that type of hinge, but \u201cWE\u201d as homeowner can replace the hinges to fix the problem at \u201cour cost\u201d.\n\n2. Seems to be a potential problem on where cabinets came from. Directly from manufacturer, stored in a warehouse, exposed to dampness, etc.. so the liability of how, where, what was done with cabinets prior to installing falls on the end buyer, being the owner of the house.\n\n3. Another option is to put silicone in frame, door panel,  this might be done by builder \u201cDR HORTON\u201d.  Since some doors do make noise and some don\u2019t, I asked if they could replace the noisy doors. We were told no guarantee that new doors would be any better.  Don\u2019t understand because we had a bad cabinet door replaced months ago, and had no issues with that door.
