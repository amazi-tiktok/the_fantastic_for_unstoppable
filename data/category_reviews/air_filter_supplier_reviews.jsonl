My wife met with Cason and we went into wanting multiple options which i thought were all fairly presented and well explained without any pressure of which to go with. I have a close friend who worked for many years for both Trane and Carrier with many of the dealers throughout Birmingham. He gave me a list of 3 companies he would have out to his home personally. Skelton was one of those, another company that i liked very much, and then one we didnt have a great experience on the quote with. Between Skelton and the other competitor, although Skeltons price was higher we were sold by the labor warranty and some of the other written guarantees, along with the rec from our friend. Installation - I believe it was Mark, my wife was the one on site - went way better than i could have imagined. We arranged last minute to have the unit moved to a new location. All of the work was very well done. I had an idea in my head of what \"the aftermath\" should have looked like and the equipment involved in the move and all that, and i probably would have been satisfied with a lot less. Its obviously a lot of money for most families, so I was bound to have some mix of buyers remorse and hesitation about whether or not we'd gone with the right people However, when i got home and saw the quality of the work, how neatly and efficiently and professionally everything was done, i immediately felt entirely confident in our decision and knew we had some true professionals out at the house. I think its the first time in my life ive spent that much money on something and dont have any regrets or second guessing about who we chose to spend it with. Kudos to both Cason and Mark's teams.

In June 2017 we replaced our old units with two American Standard ac & heating units under the previous owner and the installers were awful.  We had small gas leaks on both units, insulation around the refrigerant lines was half ass done on the downstairs unit and not even replaced on the upstairs which was dried & cracking, etc.  When I called to have the has gas smell checked out the new owners were eager to get someone sent out immediately. The smell was intermittent so I wasn't sure if there was an issue. The first time Sonny came out & took care of the downstairs gas smell.  A few hours after he left the air purifier wasn't working.  Eddie came to our house and fixed and also noticed the \"dryer\" was installed backwards on the both units. He corrected both problems in addition to gas smell upstairs, & addressed the insulation on the refrigerant lines.  Eddie was wonderful! We so appreciate the time he has spent to address the install issues.

Luckily, we had a warranty through Old Republic, which paid for a replacement unit. Unfortunately, however, the company that Old Republic required us to use for installation was 5 Star Heating and Air Conditioning out of Foley, AL.\n\nOver the past year, we have experienced several issues with our new unit not cooling the house properly. About two months ago, we came home to soggy carpet and buckled wood floors due to the drain pipe for our unit overflowing. My father came by to take a look at the unit and noticed that the \"Safe-T-Switch float valve\", which cuts the unit off if the drain pipe clogs and fills up, was installed ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE UNIT, rendering it completely useless.\n\nWe called 5 Star and they did come out to the house and move the valve to the correct side without charging us, which we felt was the least they could do since their poor workmanship was the cause of this incident. Over the past few weeks, we noticed that our outside unit would randomly cut off during the day, making the house unbearable to be inside. We called 5 Star, and they let us know that it would be $100 to come out and take a look at it. At this point, I decided to call another company to come look at it rather than paying 5 Star.\n\nThe other Service Man came out and took a look at it and noticed that the inside of the pipe that the float valve was attached to was clogged with sealant, preventing the flow of water. (See attached photos) I'm no plumber, but I can tell you that when you put sealant inside the female coupling, and push the male part in, the sealant has nowhere to go but inside the pipe, which prevents the drain pipe from being able to drain water. He replaced the drain pipe, and put the float valve in the correct place, and amazingly, our A/C unit works like new!\n\nI will be sure to let everyone know how much money my \"no-cost warranty replacement\" A/C unit has cost me thanks to 5 Star's sub-par work.\n\nPhoto 1 - Crazy Straw like drain pipe from 5 Star\nPhoto 2 - Sealant inside pipe (photo taken after I punched a large portion of the sealant out of the pipe)\nPhoto 3 - New drain pipe installed by another {competent} A/C Repair company", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfTmZE3Bd42fClrv34oV45AuBHNZQe-gBb-dcw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1534874112513, "text": "Dane, we are sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with our options for maintenance.
