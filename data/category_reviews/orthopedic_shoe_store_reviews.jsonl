We last saw Meredith in April 2020 when our state was under the \u201cStay At Home\u201d order. At the time, masks were not required but were only recommended. While I did enter the room without a mask, Meredith rudely asked why I didn\u2019t have one. I responded because they were not required; however, if it made her more comfortable I would be happy to wear one. There was no refusal to wear a mask. I would have happily worn one and now do everyday. She replied by saying that it was fine and she didn\u2019t want to argue. I agreed that I wasn\u2019t interested in arguing and only wanted to help with her inserts. After the adjustments of her device were made, I returned into the room where Meredith had apologized for her rudeness. I am shocked to have received notification of this review because she left in such a good mood. During her visit, we had safety measures in place, but masks were not one of them. In April and May, our office had anyone scheduled to notify us via phone once they had arrived. We would call them back via phone when a room was available for them to come in. As the effects of this virus increased, our office began asking everyone to wear masks during there visit. We did not make this mandatory and left the decision up to each individual. However, as of July 16, 2020 the state amended the \u201cSafer At Home\u201d order to require everyone to wear masks. As of now, we do not allow anyone in our office without a mask until this order has expired. Once expired our office will continue wearing masks but only recommend that our customers/patients wear one. We also began checking everyone\u2019s temperature by using an infrared thermometer before signing in to be seen. I\u2019m sorry that you are unhappy with how our business has attempted to operate during this unparalleled time. Hope your feet are happy!\n\nSteven Ford, C.Ped"}, "gmap_id": "0x888918a303322c55:0xbfff2036c7d6d734"}

But those are the only positive things that I can say about my experience.  The sales lady immediately asked what I was looking for and I told her that I would just like to look around for a few minutes if that was ok because this was my first time in the store.  Well, I guess that wasn\u2019t ok because she started asking me all of these questions.  I told her that I wanted to look at a pair of Birkenstock but that I had never had a pair before so I needed help with the sizing and no one in my area carried them and I had driven over an hour to come and look at them.  She immediately tried to get me to look at another name brand and told me she liked them better but I told her that I was there to look at Birkenstock.  I guess I got the wrong idea about this store, since I didn\u2019t know my size I thought maybe they would measure my feet and actually try to help with a size but I left just as about confused as I did when I went in.  She kept changing her mind about what size she thought I needed.  She ended up telling me they didn\u2019t have my size and color in stock which is ok because by this point I probably would have not bought them anyway and I don\u2019t know how she even knew about the size when she kept changing her mind.  She told me that since I had never had Birkenstock before that there was going to be a break in period and that I still needed to look at the other name brand that she was trying to push.  I told her that I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to pay $135 for a pair of shoes without reading up on them and doing a little research and that was exactly what I had done with the Birkenstock that I was interested in.  I wasn\u2019t wanting to spend that kind of money that day just because I had nothing better to do, I knew exactly what I was wanting to look at.  She told me that she didn\u2019t like Birkenstock because they hurt her feet but before I could get out of the store, she told me that she had two pairs that she loved.  What???  And if this was not already bad enough, at one point she left me standing barefoot in the middle of the store next to the Birkenstock display so she could go follow some lady around that was making a return that she had apparently helped a day or two before.  There was another associate that could have helped her.  And my sales lady was walking around with the shoe that I was needing to try on.  Needless to say, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be back and I would much rather shop at the small locally owned stores and with the craziness of the last year, you think they would appreciate your business but this store doesn\u2019t need to count on me to keep them in business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862132dc5e388db:0x4a2c43068782f22b"}

They have a great selection and can order so many additional shoes for you, as well.  The friendly and knowledgable sales associates helped me find shoes that fit my feet needs, as well as my sense of style.  While they have the styles you would expect, they have a nice selection of attractive, stylish shoes for a working professional.  Valley Sole is great about returns and even ordered another size for me when the original ones ordered ended up being too large.  I took one star off for price--these are pricer shoes and that can be hard to swallow.  But, the quality is much better and they are my go-to shoe store now, so it is worth the extra!

I found Orthaheel on the internet and was trying to locate a store to buy them.  I phoned Valley Birkenstock and was told that they stocked them and they even checked sizes for me.  The next day we visited the store and were promptly greeted and offered assistance.  When I told the young lady what I was looking for, she remembered me calling the day before and even the size we were looking for.  She promptly brought out the shoes and talked with my husband about his plantar fasciitis problems. She brought out several other shoes, a compression sock and an ice pack- all to help with the plantar fasciitis.  My husband tried everything on and was so impressed with the feel of the Orthaheel that he wore them out of the store.\n\nJulie was the young lady that was helping us and she was very knowledge about her products,and was very helpful with suggestions.  She was very kind & polite.  My husband is very pleased with all his purchases and says he will be going back soon to purchase more shoes (this coming from a man that hates to shop - especially for shoes) all because of the personal attention & helpfulness that he received.\n\nThis store really knows the definition of \"Customer Service\"!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862132dc5e388db:0x4a2c43068782f22b"}

On January 2, about 12:00pm, I went back with the unworn product, in the original box, receipt still in the box, to return the item.  (Note: A time lapse of less than 6 hours as they were closed on the 1st.)\nI was told that I could not return it because it was sale merchandize.\nThe communication of that policy was extremely poor- it is not posted, the sale items are not marked, individually or as a group, and the sales people do not tell you verbally.\nThe only place that policy is communicated is on the sales receipt.  In addition, there are no prices on anything: sale or regular price items.\n\nThe store manager told the sales girl that she would take care of me, asked me to wait while she checked on something.  Returning to take care of me, she informed me that she had checked store records and since I was a regular customer I knew  about the \"no return on sales merchandize\" policy and therefore she could not help me.  (This should give you cause for concern, regular customers are given no preferential treatment.)\nShe offered for me to leave the item with her and said that if I did and walked out, she had no further obligation.\nI continued to try to convince her that I was a new customer and had no idea about the policy.  I asked where it was posted, etc.  Her response was that in the state of Alabama it is \"Buyer Beware\".  I agreed that she could enforce that policy.\n\nI asked if she typically opened the shoe box to read the receipt before she left stores so she could find \"no return\" policies, because that is the only way I could have discovered theirs. (I use the word 'discover' intentionally because this store seems to hide everything: prices, policies...)\nI told her that reputation is important these days with internet data accessibility and that she left me with no alternative but to blog this occurrence.\nThen she wrote me a receipt stating the amount I was owed I could spend in cash with that piece of paper and if I lost it there would be no effort of correction.\n\nAs if all of this, and the fact that I was now required to return, was not bad enough, when I turned to leave she told me that had I behaved differently she could have resolved this another way.  Basically, she did not like me (subjective) so she chose not to return my money.\nTHIS IS A HORRIBLE WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS!!  She just admitted to me that she could have given me what I asked for.  God forbid we do what the customer wants.\nMy thoughts are that their business model is failing.  The only reason to go in this store is to try on the shoes you want to purchase for a fit check and then go and purchase them at a discounted price on the internet.\nThe manager's justification from the other blogs--that it is a service oriented store is untrue.  The sales staff is so immature and inexperienced that they are a bother.  If you ask a price you are told, \"oh it is about...\"  About?  When I am shopping and spending these amounts of money, I want to know the exact price.\nThey seem to have lost sight of the personal aspect of the business and are overly concerned with money.  As an example, did they not think that the sales person (blogged earlier) could also be a customer?  Can they not relate that his experience, and mine, will be publicized for other people's benefit?\nI have never been so poorly treated, ever.\nWhat a shame I have to go back.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1359382495176, "text": "Dear Sophia,\n\nThanks for your feedback. Valley Birkenstock Sole is sorry to hear you are unhappy. We would like to help. Our policy for sale shoes is no return as these are priced for clearance.  Customers are told at the time of\npurchase and it is stated on our receipts that SALE shoe purchases are final.\nNormally we do not return sale shoes as is the policy, but it sounds like our manager accommodated you by giving you a store credit to purchase something else. When you return, if you will identify yourself to one of the owners, we will personally take care of you and make sure any questions or issues you have are addressed.\nValley Birkenstock Sole takes pride in well trained staff who offer full, sit down service.
