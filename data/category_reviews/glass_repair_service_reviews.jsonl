They were the only one of the five companies that realized there was not a stud behind the tile where the door was to be installed and actually recommended a solution that ended up saving us money (though they also made sure I knew they were capable of going with the more expensive solution if we decided to go that route).\n\nUsing the information that they provided, I was able to go back and get a slightly cheaper quote from one of the other companies. Despite that, I went with Madison Glass because I felt I could trust Wade and Kevin to do the job right. I'm glad I did.\n\nWe had a small hiccup with the manufacturer on the first replacement window and shower door that came in, but Wade and Kevin set us up for the mean time and made sure to prioritize getting back out as soon as the replacement glass came in.\n\nThe shower looks great, the service was excellent, they let us know what to expect and then kept us informed throughout the process, and we ended up spending less than what we expected.

The inside of the business was also clean and tidy.\n\nI do have one complaint though, and I try my best not to give poor reviews. Also, seeing that 90% of the reviews are good, maybe it was just a fluke, but important to note nonetheless. When I picked up the car, the windshield placement looked fine (from what a non experienced person could tell) but the inside dash had a layer of fine and semi-fine glass shards mixed with rubber debris. It was even inside my air vents so I couldn't turn on the air for fear that the glass particles would end up all over me. Also there were some on the floor and cup holders. I had to clean this up immediately once I got home. I wouldn't have minded so much if it was just plastic/rubber debris, because I've come to expect when you have work done on your car, they leave a little mess, but this was glass and that is not acceptable.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1427131071286, "text": "Stephanie,\n\nI truly apologize for your vehicle not being cleaned to your satisfaction.

My SUV was more difficult. I asked for good quality glass and I'm not exactly sure what I got.\nI wanted the glass installed following the instructions spelled out in the factory Service Manual. When I would explain to the installers how it NEEDED to be done they pushed back by saying that was not necessary. My SUV has a specific way to install the windshield that is out of the ordinary. If steps aren't followed then its going to leak. They assured me that it wouldn't leak the way they did it and I really did not want to put that to the test with their way of doing it. I supplied my own new factory gasket for the job. If I had not had that they would have reused the 20 year old gasket that was glued to the old windshield. The manual says to use a NEW gasket.\n\nAll the glass installers I have delt with to get this done have just about all been the same. They are payed by they job and want to get done and on to the next job. I care about my car and if I'm gong to pay to have this done I want it done right. As the customer they need to consider that I probably have a good idea what I'm talking about and should listen and absorb what I'm telling them because I didn't want it to leak and I know they didn't want to have to come back and fix it.\n\nMy experience with the installers that came today was the reason for the bad rating. I don't appreciate their attitude towards my instructions I had for them.  I walked inside to get cash to pay them while they were working and quietly came back outside to hear them talking about me and how I was trying to micromanage them.  One of the guys actually told me he could see why they other companies didn't want to do the job. Which was a rude thing to say. He couldn't handle I wanted things done a certain way (the correct way).\n\nI'm sure most windshields are simple and easy to replace.
