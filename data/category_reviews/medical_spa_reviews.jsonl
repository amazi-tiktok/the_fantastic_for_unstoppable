High hematocrits can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in chronic smokers. Dehydration produces a falsely high hematocrit that disappears when proper fluid balance is restored. Some other infrequent causes of an elevated hematocrit are lung disease, certain tumors, a disorder of the bone marrow known as polycythemia rubra Vera, and abuse of the drug erythropoietin (Epogen) by athletes for \"blood doping\" purposes.\nSir, I hope you're doing well, but I must say it doesnt look like your issues are from any hormone treatment recieved from anywhere at all! ~Sincerely, Wanda... a satisfied client.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862847f46de7615:0xa3575d271917d609"}

I would not recommend this clinic to anyone. I had tried contacting the office for a week to have a prescription filled with no response. My pharmacy called and told me they too could not get a response from the clinic either. I emailed yesterday to state how ridiculous I thought it was for there to be this little communication with patients, especially ones that need a prescription refilled. To my disbelief I received a personal phone call from Dr. Sawyer herself on a Saturday at 3:00 only to call me out for the email I sent, because the email I sent said \u201cridiculous\u201d in it. She called me rude many times and then stated i would no longer be a patient of DLA. Dr Sawyer then went on to tell me that the entire DLA staff had, had  many negative discussions about me in the past. I have been left confused, as when I asked for how I have ever been rude to anyone at DLA she hung up on me. I can assure you, that this was a mistake on the entire DLA staff and Dr. Sawyer, as she spoke to me as I was a completely different person then who she thought she was speaking too. After that very disturbing and unprofessional phone call, I am thankful to move to a different clinic. I can not fathom a physician directly calling and speaking to a patient in the manner Dr. Sawyer did, and going out of her way to do so on a Saturday afternoon just to tell me all this and without verifying my information before being aggressive towards me. She definitely was mistaken on who I was, but I will never return.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891984634d17c3:0x88b9f487866c1239"}

She was upfront and told me that it would likely not give me the results I was looking for (apparently red / black are pretty easy to get out but green / purple is more difficult). She saved me multiple sessions at $150/pop and a potentially worse situation than I am already in if all of the pigment was removed (leaving a totally white version of the tattoo).  I really appreciate that kind of honesty  - especially when I was walking in with no real knowledge of the laser removal process and money in hand.  I really respect them for this business practice.

After three days of not getting a response I called the office and the receptionist was nice and scheduled me for the only available appointment until August. The next day I received a call from another receptionist responding to my voicemail that I sent earlier that week..... The day of the appointment I called Dr. Willis office EIGHT times trying to get someone to help me locate the office (I hadn't been there in two years because of school). After the first three calls not being answered (15 minutes late to the appointment at this point) I was transferred to the emergency line (was on hold for 5 mins). Without even asking my needs I was transferred to another hotline which transferred me to another hotline that transferred me back to the original person I was trying to speak with! After being on hold multiple times for almost 15 minutes I hung up, called back and the exact same thing happened again. After 30 minutes of trying to find the office I finally was able to talk to someone and ended up canceling the appointment.\n\nThis was the most frustrating and difficult doctor's experience I've ever had.

I had to make an emergency trip to come back to the state of Alabama - just to have them dissolve the fillers.  A year later, I still have a permanent lump from the injections - which is noticeable with or without lipstick.  I wish I would of took more time and did research, rather than being spontaneous and just going for it - while passing through.  I gave them 2 stars, because Dr. Brunson- did give me his personal number and  stated he would correct it - but when I called the office (infinity Med-I-Spa) to make arrangements - I was given the run-around!

You said,  \u201cgo talk to a doctor about the sleeve /weight loss surgery then come back and see me.\u201dBest decision I\u2019ve ever made, I just couldn\u2019t do it any other way.  80lbs later, I am healthier and happier for it.  Then I came back and you did your magic makeover on me. You took all that skin and snatched it back even better than I was before including my scratch marks from 2 children. You sculpting my waistline like I had been in the gym all my days. My breast lift looks like Im a 20 years old again.  You absolutely did an amazing job and gave me back my confidence and my active life with my family again.  The only downside is I am happily married and have to fight the guys off daily now.  One gentleman who was 55 years old, asked how old I was and I said your age. He continued to say, women don\u2019t look like you at our age because he had been looking for a while.  I didn\u2019t share my secret, I just said thank you. But he kept saying wow you are beautiful so maybe I should have.  Needless to say it is a good thing I love myself, my husband and GOD.  Yes, my husband loves my new body also but he is more excited that I will  come Jet-skiing with him now and I\u2019m back at the beach again feeling confident.

I noticed a pattern that a lot of reviewers complained of the wait time and I will say that I did have a couple appointments where I waited a little longer to be seen. It really wasn\u2019t that long so it was barely worth mentioning but I figured I would since it seems to be an issue with other patients. But knowing what I know now I understand why. Dr. Voss is amazing. I came in for my pregnancy and ended up being high risk. She explained everything in great detail and what the plan would be for my pregnancy. She even addressed why there may be a longer wait time sometimes, which I didn\u2019t even bring up, but I thought it was nice that she did. It shows that she\u2019s aware of patient concerns and doing what she can about it. They see patients for regular appointments but also unscheduled appointments if there is an issue that isn\u2019t severe enough for the ER but still needs to be addressed quickly. This was me on a couple of occasions. I called in the morning on 3 separate occasions and was seen within a couple of hours due to complications with my pregnancy. So I really appreciate being seen so quickly and will take waiting a little bit longer for scheduled appointments because of it. The entire staff is very friendly and attentive. When things got serious with my pregnancy Dr.Voss was on top of it and I couldn\u2019t have asked for better care. Things could have gone a lot worse for a lot of reasons but her quick action due to her vast knowledge made sure that the outcome was best case scenario.

As for my Aesetician - we work together as a team we will always work together as a team as that has always created the most beautiful outcomes for our patients.\nDoctors who rush through bruising injections do not create the elaborate beautiful outcomes that I have with Christy - who has achieved the status of master aesthetician- and who spends time understanding the contours and the nuances of need and translating them to me as we work as a team.  This is precise injecting work that I am trained and certified to do - as well as an artistic level of teamwork that I don\u2019t think anyone else achieves especially around this region and therefore anyone who criticizes us has no understanding of what we really do and possibly intends us harm  and ill wishes - which is a very sad (and abysmally low) method of demanding a refund.\n\nWe adhere to the strictest guidelines in hygienic standards and we have some of the most creative combinations of med spa packages that are unlike any around as we are not just any MedSpa but we are gynecologic med spa and we have everything female just for you and more ;)\n\nPlease take some of the negative comments below as encouragement for us to get better especially with our waiting room time -we run into obstetrical emergencies and take immaculate care of our patients and apologize in advance for waiting room misfortunes. We are constantly taking these as constructive criticism for us to get better as negative as they may seem.\n\nHowever I do take exception to one very negative comment below as you will see I believe this person has reflected more of her own self explanatory emotional disabilities than anyone else\u2019s.

She spent about 20mins or so in the room with me she explained everything in great depth and reassured me questions that I worried about were nothing to be concerned about.

I immediately switched to Dr. Heim whom when he saw the size of my son could not believe that I had him vaginally.

On my first visit the doctor seemed very rushed. He did not ask a single question. He prescribed a lotion that caused a reaction. While I do not blame them for the reaction, the way it was handled once the rash breakout occurred was ridiculously. It took 7 hours for a nurse to call me back. During this time, they did not have a time available for me to come in despite the reaction continuously spreading. Once I finally received a call back they felt no need for me to come in despite my concern. The solution was to put some cortizone you can get at any drug store. They also stated the bumps I incurred probably wouldn\u2019t clear up completely. The rash like breakout was extremely concerning and it is troubling they would not be concerned with a breakout they caused. The fact the solution wouldn\u2019t completely resolve the issue caused by their prescription is unacceptable.

They say you can go back to work or they give you 1 week to recuperate, and you have to ice and heating pad, how can that be effective when, how is it possible to do that at work. I think the down time should be as long as you have to wear the compression hoses.  Walking can be done at home.  Also dis-appointed that the compression hose can't be purchased throw the office with insurance, because insurance does pay for it...", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563812917203, "text": "I'm pleased you were happy with your procedure, however, I'm disappointed you were dissatisfied with the other aspects you mentioned.  Customarily post procedure, most everyone returns to work and daily activities the very next day or two at the latest.  We understand not everyone recovers the same, additional time to to feel back to normal may be warranted.  We would have been more than happy to extend your time off with a work excuse...not a problem at all.  If you experience post procedure discomfort, you are welcome to try heat or ice to the area that is bothering you.  Yes, this would be difficult while at work, this is intended to be done while resting at home.  Compression hose is to be worn for 2 weeks following the ablation procedure.  We want you to resume walking and regular day to day activities within the next day or two at the latest while wearing the compression hose, just not strenuous exercise or running for 2 weeks.  This will aid in your recovery and prevent post procedure swelling plus minimize the risk even further for blood clots.  We don't want you to sit around not moving for 2 weeks, that will only prolong the recovery process.   Compression hose is covered by only 1 of the 50+ insurance companies that we accept....and only on a case by case basis with that one carrier....after we submit your medical records for review by the insurance investigator.  The majority of the time this charge is denied.  We charge the patient for the compression hose up front, if insurance happens to reimburse us for the hose, we will refund the purchase price to the patient immediately.  Unfortunately, this happens only 3-4 times a year.  Some patients attempt to recover the charge on their own by submitting the charge....they are sometimes successful, however, it is only with the one insurance company.  I promise you will receive a reimbursement for the hose if we receive a reimbursement from the insurance company.  Again, I'm terribly sorry you are disappointed.....we would be delighted to meet with you in the office to discuss your concerns.  I appreciate you taking the time to review us....we strive to be a dedicated center of excellence.  Reviews help us improve our patient care and office policy. If we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at 205.823.0151 or to me directly at the info below.

Lastly, Dr. Sami personally contacted me the evenings of each procedure, I was pleasantly shocked and excited to have my him call to inquire how I was doing as the pain was intense.

The office is very nice, VERY efficient (we were in an out within an hour), and the Dr. himself seems attentive, and even called to check in on us that evening. My problem is with the post-op info - or lack thereof - from the nurse who helped my husband to the car.\n\nShe handed me a single sheet that mostly covered medication schedules and dietary restrictions, a pack of gauze, and 4 prescriptions. I have no knowledge of how to care for oral postop things, but my mom's a nurse so i know these things can go smoothly or horribly depending on the patient's choices after surgery - behavior that is usually informed by the advise of medical staff, since the general populace is presumably ignorant (safest assumption). I asked if I needed to replace the gauze as soon as we got home, and was about to ask what all he needed to avoid doing. The nurse quickly said, cordially but also sharply such that she cut me off before i could ask, \"everything you need to know is written on this sheet\" and told me to call if I had questions. Well, long story short he ended up using a straw and doing a few other things I had no idea he wasn't supposed to, because i didn't //know// those were things i needed to ask about, and the sheet made no mention of any of them. I am now unsure how much of his pain is a natural consequence, and how much is our fault. So now we're keeping an eye on, questioning every symptom, which is stressful for both of us.

During that time, the intent was to keep my teeth and gums as healthy as possible. Regularly scheduled deep cleaning worked. However, my doctor retired and the new staff had different ideas. The regularly scheduled deep cleaning was no longer an option, and within a couple of years my teeth deteriorated to the point where it was embarrassing to even smile. The new staff recommended extractions, at first only a few teeth. Ultimately, they planned to extract all my teeth and do implants. I agreed to have the first three teeth extracted. That was the beginning of a horrible time for me. After the extractions I bled profusely and was in a lot of pain. For two weeks I continued to bleed on and off. I was frightened ,I could not eat, and I was miserable. As time passed it didn't get much better, and I was not myself, as I was normally very outgoing and talkative, but now became very uncomfortable around people. The staff then recommended extracting the rest of my teeth and doing implants. But I was afraid of what might happen after the last experience. I thought, \"if I bled so profusely from 3 extractions, how would my body react to all my teeth being extracted\". The thoughts going through my head were all scary and uncertain. I sought out other opinions, but did not have a good feeling with anyone. Finally, in late 2016, I met with Dr. Sam Nizam. When we met, I immediately felt the connection, and I was comfortable. Dr. Sam listened to all my concerns attentively. I knew the qualities in a doctor that I was looking for and Dr. Sam had all of them. Dr. Sam sat me down and explained step by step what he recommended and how the procedures would be done. He was so calm and confident, and did not sugar coat anything. He explained that I needed 26 extractions, and why. He explained that I needed bone grafting for the implants to take, where he would need to do the grafting, and why. He explained that I needed a sinus lift, and where and why. Also, he showed me visually on the computer and pointed out exactly where my implants would be placed, to have the best chance of success. He explained how all procedures would be done at the same time. I was still nervous about the whole process, but I had total confidence in Dr. Sam and agreed to schedule it as soon as possible. It was February, 2018. I was in surgery for 5 1/2 hours. He performed all the work that he had explained to me. I went home, knowing I was in good hands and that I was going to be fine. But I was just a little nervous, thinking I might bleed. Dr. Sam prescribed pain killers, which I took that night and went to sleep. I awoke after a peaceful night sleep. My bleeding was the size of a dime!. I had minimal pain. I stopped taking the pain killers. I went back for a follow up. Dr. Sam was pleased with the results and so was I. No pain, no bleeding, the implants (all 11 of them) all took. I now have new teeth. I can smile again. I can speak without fear and embarrassment. At my daughter's wedding I was able to proudly smile and laugh all night! Dr. Sam gave me my life back! I am myself again! Thank you!! I will always be grateful to Dr. Sam for the incredible work he did, that now gives me the chance to enjoy life as I had not been able to do for so long. If I ever have a problem, even though I now live many states away in New Jersey, I would not hesitate to make the trip. I recommend Dr. Sam highly . He has been blessed with a tremendous talent and gift to help people. I wish him all the best,and pray that his success helps thousands more like me in the future. - Linda K", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXOD5MDeQykhOWyJzNjQ_ZTNsvFxMngiU7Owt6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b3cc3f973f1:0xa4ac2f65d2cc478d"}

The first two treatments cost me $150. The second time I came in my specialist informed me that the prices will raise to $200 per IPL session. No problem for me, well... I came in earlier this week to get only CHEEKS and CHIN done and she charged me $350$!!! NO ONE informed me it would be that high! Last time I came in I was told $200. $350 for a partial face treatment is absolutely insane price. I\u2019ve been getting these treatments done all over the country and I\u2019ve NEVER had anyone charge me that much for a partial face IPL. Honestly, she should have told me before the treatment that it would be that much! I\u2019ve seen her three times. I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal about it by the time she charged me because I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene but I\u2019m honestly very unhappy with the lack of communication from this business.

The Groupon had already been redeemed by the business and there was a 24 hour cancellation policy. I understand the policy but why was my Groupon redeemed before services were rendered. When I finally got there through traffic, they said that I would only have 20 minutes for a massage.  I politely said ,\"Thats okay, it's been a long week and my birthday is tomorrow. Dont worry about it.\"  So I left and I was a little hurt by the customer service I had received at this point and I went back in to ask if they were apart of the BBB, because at this point I saw where this was going.  The young lady at the front was really rude toward me and so was the man who is a massage therapists. I have scoliosis and I was looking for some relief for my birthday. I'm African American and I am just wondering if I wasn't, if it would've made a difference at all. I called to ask about the policy because I want to be treated fairly. The phone disconnected while I was asking and when I called back it went to voicemail. I called back from a different number and the phone was answered then it was passed to a man works there and he was even more rude than the young lady working at the front. I was in shock how fast he got annoyed with me and I wasn't being disrespectful at all. He then said that if I called back he would file harassment charges against me, then hung up me in my face. As a first time customer, I felt like I was treated really badly.

I figured since it was a more upscale spa that I would only have positive things to say, but I was very wrong. I went to get one syringe of Restylane. The doctor examined the structure of my face then proceeded to prepare injecting. First, he did not clean off the area he was injecting. Second, he did not wash his hands or put gloves on before touching all over my face or doing the injection. To no surprise because I have sensitive skin, the very next day I broke out in the same exact spot he touched. While injecting, he was sitting on a stool while I was propped up in the patient\u2019s chair. I\u2019m no doctor but I\u2019m pretty certain that as the injector, he should\u2019ve been standing to get a clear view of exactly where and how much product he was injecting. Lastly, he did not massage or smooth out the product during or immediately after injecting!! Which resulted in a lump. It wasn\u2019t very noticeable from just looking at me from the front. However, I could definitely feel it and from the side view of my face you could tell something wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\nI gave it a couple of days for the slight swelling I had to go down and to give time for the Restylane to settle in. Also, he put more than half the syringe on one side of my face and what felt like air in the other side because there was no difference at all.  ALSO, the lump I felt was more so in the lowest portion of my check rather than the actual smile line where it should\u2019ve been. I\u2019m assuming this was due to him sitting during the injection and not having a clear view of what he was doing. 10 days later, lump is still there. I went back to the office and all he could do was offer to inject another syringe for $100 off. I declined the offer because I refused to spend any more money at that spa. Do not go here to get fillers.\n\nDr. Marlow at Infinty Med-i-Spa fixed all the issues I had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ebafd8231d1:0xcf48d168ceb00c66"}

I felt very comfortable discussing my dental issue with him.\n\nNo dental procedure is ever \u201cfun\u201c - especially when a tooth must be extracted, but the procedure was done in a second it seemed. Of course, I asked to be sedated so I didn\u2019t feel a thing! Everything went very well!

We discussed a breast lift with augmentation.  We were going to do it in one surgery.  Upon further study, Dr. McLain decided to do it in two surgeries instead because he felt like I would get better results and the healing process would be much easier on me.

Everyone was telling me it was a very unpleasant procedure, but they were wrong in this case!. The doctor made me wait an extra five minutes on the anesthesia to make doubly sure I was completely numb, which I appreciated. Basically, he didn't try to  rush this at my expense.  And, I felt zero pain, not even any discomfort at all!  Even my stitches (which will dissolve) haven't bothered me.\nMy husband drove me home, but I could have driven myself, since I didn't even have the expected bleeding.  The anesthesia just barely started wearing off after I'd already taken my first prescription for pain medication, and so I never suffered at all. When I woke up the next morning, I was prepared to take more pain medication, but I realized I didn't need it and never took any more. What a pleasant surprise.\nDr. McLain personally called me the same evening to find out if I was doing okay.\nAlso, the actual wound was closed up so neatly, you could barely even see it.  Maybe that's because the doctor is also a cosmetic surgeon.  After this experience, I would wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Mclain to anyone.
