As soon as I walked in the door my experience was much better than the first. Charlene immediately greeted me and sat and talked with me about some of my concerns and then took me back to get pictures done. Dr. Todd then came in and went over a few options and courses that we could take. I told him a little about my lifestyle and we quickly picked the option that was best for me. After talking with them I was sure that I wanted to do it the same day and they were able to work me in. I decided to pay some down and do the payment plan which was quick and easy. The payment plan automatically takes the payment out of your checking account (not a card) which is really good for me because I am forgetful. We talked about the paperwork and then Charlene took me back to Hayes who put on my brackets with Dr. Todd. She talked me through everything she was doing which was really helpful because I had never worn braces before so this whole experience is new to me. When she was done she showed me how to brush with the braces and how to floss. She even told me what to do in case this this or this happened (I was really worried about something breaking and not knowing what to do so this made me feel a lot better.) She gave me a little bag and Charlene made my next appointment and I was out the door. The entire ordeal took about 2 hours and I was very pleased.

Dr. Todd did my initial consultation, and he gave me a clear and accurate idea of what to expect from treatment, how the treatment was going to take place and a rough estimate of the time required. Their prices are very competitive and there were no extras or hidden fees, everything was clearly presented from a financial standpoint. They use state of the art digital equipment to provide the most efficient care possible, which makes traditional impressions unnecessary, in fact the only time I had to do an impression the whole time I was there was to get my retainer. The best part of PT Ortho, however, is the atmosphere and how they really treat each and every patient as an individual. Combine that with the upbeat and friendly nature of the assistants, the cheerful music, and the relaxed setting - suddenly going to the orthodontist isn't a dreaded activity, in fact it was almost fun! I highly recommend this orthodontist to anyone, children and adults, who need or are considering treatment.

The low rating is for how the staff and dentist treated myself and my daughter. My 4 1/2 year old does really well with doctor offices and dentist as long as things are explained and she knows what to expect. For instance, she doesn\u2019t cry when she gets a shot because she knows it coming and knows what to expect. I do understand that medical professionals need to do their job and get the information needed. I respect medical personnel and have good relationship with all my providers and my girls\u2019 providers.\nSo why the low rating. For starters the moment we walked in to the examination room, the assistant shoved an iPad in my daughters face without my consent. Again, my daughter is very curious and likes to ask question and know whats going on. During the exam, the assistant kept asking my daughter questions, while she\u2019s watching this show (expecting a 4 year old to multitask, wonderful). My daughter was great during the exam, everything was fine until the X-rays. The staff outright lied and said it wouldn\u2019t hurt. They made me and my youngest daughter leave the room for the x-rays, which i was already uncomfortable with. After the first three x-rays, i hear screams on the last X-ray. I wanted to go in to calm her and help her through it but was not allowed. I saw two more nurses go in and heard more screaming... if i hadn\u2019t had my 1 year old with me i would have burst in there; even now I feel horrible for not doing so. Anyway, after they got the final X-rays the dentist and assistant came back in to check her teeth. Of course she lost trust in them and was freaking out. I was trying to calm her down while they were talking over me and physically restraining my daughter without my consent. I signaled them to back off while i talked to her and calmed her down. We will never return there. I wish I would have just walked in there during the X-rays , grabbed her, and walked out. I DO NOT think it is acceptable in non emergency situations to hold a child down like they did, especially without my consent.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888dc135c41337f:0x6f5e3062ffb2d723"}

You are ALWAYS greeted by name and with a huge smile. (And don't even get me started on the inviting aroma put off by the homemade chocolate chip cookies. YES, you read that right, they literally make homemade chocolate chip cookies EVERY morning for patients to enjoy! And they have like 9 different flavors of coffee, which is a HUGE perk for a working mom like myself!) The office itself is absolutely beautiful with a game room for children, comfortable seating with charging stations and some amazing art highlighting our awesome city! They even have really cool monthly contests for patients with really awesome prizes! It is the little touches like these that make this office one I actually enjoy coming to...and I haven't even discussed my treatment yet!\n\nAside from the overall aesthetics of Dr. Backus's office, the level of exceptional care you will receive is unparalleled in my opinion. From the moment I sat down with Dr. Backus and her Treatment Coordinator, I was a patient for life! I was so hesitant about getting braces (I am in my 30s), but they made me feel so comfortable about my decision. The consultation was informative, fun and really interesting! You get your own personalized treatment plan, a breakdown of your financial plan and just an overall sense of knowing that you will be taken care of. They even have the Financial Coordinator available that day to discuss any questions you may have which is a huge plus, because I know nothing about dental insurance, haha!\n\nMy treatment far exceeded my expectations. Dr. Backus's attention to detail is remarkable. With every appointment, she was able to explain to me exactly what needed to happen in order to create my perfect smile. I was blown away! The level of professionalism from each and every team member cannot go without mentioning either. They had the greatest chair side manner and I truly looked forward to each appointment that I got to see them at! Every visit was fast and enjoyable and I can happily/proudly say, I even got my braces off earlier than expected (with good compliance of course) and am now rocking my gorgeous Backus Braces smile!\n\nOverall, if you want a personalized treatment plan, a comfortable office, a very knowledgeable doctor and a thoroughly rewarding experience, you have to go see Dr. Dominique Backus. She puts the fun back in Orthodontics!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1582751769021, "text": "Alex, WOW!!! Thank you SO much for your kind words!

So he suggested to work if straightening my teeth and closing the gap and then placing crowns on the baby teeth. So a little over a year later I completed my treatment and I feel like a new person.

Dr. Scott seemed very helpful the first visit and told me I had a wisdom tooth that had a cavity, the root was short and he could pop it out.  I agreed that when I came back for my cleaning, he could extract it. (Mind you, I had no pain from that tooth nor was it bothering me at all.) I went back for the cleaning/extraction and after a couple of tries, he couldn't pull it.  So he offered to fill it.  I asked if that would fix it and he said yes.  I agreed and paid for the filling.  That afternoon when the lidocaine wore off, I was crying in pain.  I couldn't sleep and could only get a small amount of relief for about an hour by taking ibuprofen and pain medication.  That was on Thursday and they were closed Friday. I called back on Monday and asked if Dr. Scott could see me because I was in terrible pain from the failed extraction.  I was offered an appointment the next day.  Later that morning, I was called and told there was an appointment available that day, when I agreed to take it, the lady asked if it was for a toothache only.  I told her no, explained the situation and she put me on hold.  A couple minutes later she came back and said Dr. Scott said there's nothing else he can do for you, you need to go to an oral surgeon.  She gave me the number to the surgeon, needless to say I have to have it surgically removed and a bone graft done as well.  I don't see why Dr. Scott couldn't have at least seen me to see if there was another issue that was caused by the failed extraction or to see why I am in so much pain.   I wish he hadn't tried to extract the tooth, especially when the root was curved and not able to be pulled.  I was so disappointed.

We pride ourselves on great customer service and your review has been helpful to me for training purposes. I want to give you a heart-felt apology and say that I am sorry. I want you to be happy and to regain confidence in our practice. I think there was a little miscommunication or lack of information with the retainer repair.  We routinely repair retainers in the manner that you described because we don't want to take off something that has been in place and functioning well for so long as it has in your case (open a can of worms). Not to get too technical but the bond strength is often reduced when the retainer is removed completely and replaced. I would love the ability to make things right by you. Please feel free to call me anytime my cell number is 251-604-5759. Also, if you would like to have the complete retainer replaced, i would be happy arrange for that at your convenience.

If I'd been told I wouldn't be able to fully close my mouth for at least several months before they put on braces, I wouldn't have done it in the first place.\n\nSecondly, they don't listen.  I had a wire tearing up one side of my mouth for over a week.  I complained to the assistants on three separate office visits before one of them finally got the doctor and he immediately saw the problem and fixed it.\n\nThe final straw was when I couldn't tolerate the braces any longer and they broke a corner off one of my front teeth when they pulled the brackets off.  No one said a word to me about what they'd done.

So this google rating is bogus.\nI will say ultimately the results of the braces were satisfactory. But that\u2019s where the good review ends.\nWe made the first appointment with them to just inquire about braces and how much they would be  and upon arrival they brought her in and started trying to put bands in her mouth without talking to me about money and using pictures that were three years old(we had taken her up there for a consultation when she was 10, she was 13 when the braces were put on. I got back those same pictures of her at 10years old today as the \u201cbefore\u201d pictures... yeah three years before the braces even started... wow! Did y\u2019all not actually even have any real before pictures?) I had to say stop so that they would answer questions and realize they hadn\u2019t even seen this girl in three years.\nThen they put the braces on and half of them fell off within only a few hours of putting them on and we had to go back to have them fixed.\nThen after giving them my bank account information they failed to draft the payment for a couple of months so I had to back pay them. I talked to several people about this issue to have it fixed and they did the same thing again.\nThen I have a stepson that is using them and they have done the same thing to his account. Also multiple times they would change his appointments without even asking to see if it was good with us and just emailed the new date and time, how considerate.\nToday we show up to have the braces removed and they tell me I have to pay them 134$ today. I was not told about this before today and when I inquired about why the charge today the receptionist was confused and told me a bunch of stuff that wasn\u2019t even factual about the charge and my account. When I finally talked to someone who knew what they were talking about she told me that the last payment had been scheduled to come out in August(it\u2019s july now) and that I needed to pay this today. I said that I would come get my daughter as I did not have the extra 134 dollars appropriated at the moment and to her credit she allowed me to keep the last payment in August and my daughter still got her braces off.\nThis is too many issues to deal with when you are paying someone $5000 dollars for their service.\nI would not have wrote this review had I not learned that they bribed my child with free teeth whitener for a 5 star review.\nI have an 11 yo daughter who will be needing braces and I\u2019ll give you one guess as to which business won\u2019t be doing them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563994346783, "text": "At Island Orthodontics, we are passionate about creating beautiful, healthy smiles for our patients.

From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeting with compassion and understanding, and assured that they could fix her crowns.  They immediately scheduled an appoint for that same week to do her evaluation.  In that first appointment, Dr. Wilson laid out exactly what needed to be done, gave us a time frame for the work to be completed with cost estimates, and hand made her a set of temporaries that looked better than any of the final crowns from the other dentists we had worked with.  He performed laser dentistry on her gums to give her a bigger smile, used the KOR whitening system to give her a bright white color to her teeth, and put on two new crowns that he gets from a lab in Hollywood, CA.  I can proudly say today that my wife has a beautiful smile that she is so proud of thanks to the work of Dr. Wilson and his staff at Signature Smiles.

I scheduled my appointment with the dental rep and asked what I could expect. She told me to plan to be there about an hour. They would clean, polish and then give me the Sheer Whitening treatments. Wow, I thought, pretty good prize. I proceeded to ask what kind of whitening treatments they used, 5 day strips, ugh, I thought, oh well.\n\nUnfortunately, I arrived for my appointment about 10 minutes late, however, not intentional. The receptionist was a bit unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because I was late. Shortly, a dental assistant came to me with a clip board and 5 pages to fill out. I completed my basic information and soon realized they were wanting more info than was totally necessary to claim a prize. I began scanning over the pages and stopped immediately. They were asking me everything from signing to consent to pay for the charges they would render to me today and insurance could not be filed to authorizing them to obtain my dental records from my current dentist. I proceeded to the receptionist and told her there was obviously a mistake, I was asked to fill out patient paperwork and that I was only there to redeem my gift certificate. She told me to proceed completing the paperwork so that they could keep it on file. I looked at her in disbelief and sat back down placing the pen under the clip. I guess she signaled the assistant who came out and retrieved my paperwork. I waited for over 30 minutes before they called me back. I followed the assistant back to a dental room and she handed me a box of strips and about 5 minutes of instruction. Do you have any questions? I said, \"Are we done?\", she said yes that's it. Hmm, so they led me to believe that the cleaning and polishing were part of my prize when really they were going to bill me for this when they were finished. I guess I didn't fall for their trap. Talk about deceitful, a good reputable business does not do business this way. I will not be back. I will still use my strips, but could have got them at Wal-mart for $12.00. What a joke.

Of course there has always been a nice wait time but we decided to continue going there despite waiting a while to be seen. But this last time really made us change our mind. We have 3 children to receive updates on as they are being seen. As I sit down near my youngest daughter, and reach for my phone her hygienist tells me I have to leave because I have my phone out. I'm shocked, because I had just taken my phone out to return a text from my husband  as he wanted to know how the appointments were going. She would not continue my daughter's appointment until she escorted me out of the area. Now I completely understand businesses asking for cell phones to be turned on silent but to tell me that I cannot use my phone AT ALL is completely absurd! I have taken time from my off day to come to this business to bring my children and you're telling me I have to go to a consultation room just to use my phone.  I have already driven 30 minutes to come from my side of town, I  could have easily changed them to a Dr less than 5 minutes from home and had little to no wait time. In addition to all this, I'm trying to get information on my best friend who is in the ICU and no one knows what's going on because I can't use my phone to get the messages. Someone must have notified the manager because she came to talk, but she wanted to do it around my children and that was not going to happen.

When I first walked into Dr. Ferreira's office my fist thoughts were, \"This is too fancy to be affordable\", but never judge a book by its cover, because if I had I would have made the wrong decision. After finally meeting and talking with Dr. Ferreira, I was thoroughly shocked at how his process of treatment could be so advanced but the price was essentially the same as Bernardi. Right then the choice was very clear to stay with Dr. Ferreira. And I can say now this has made all the difference. Ever since that decision has been reaffirmed time and time again, he always takes time out of his schedule to answer any questions I may have. Also, such as today he called and checked in to make sure everything was good with my braces, something you will almost NEVER find at another facility. Advanced Ortho. is simply astonishing when it comes to customer service. With wonderful staff and speedy service I would recommend this facility to anyone in need of orthodontic service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb1f2a13d6cb3:0x6312d28fa711f8b6"}

My son has been a patient at Deerfoot Dental since his teeth really started coming through. We left a message after hours and Dr. Grovestein called us back! He asked us to text him photos of my sons teeth. We sent the pics and he called us back. He reassured us that it probably wasn\u2019t as bad as it seems and he would meet us at his office the next morning. So he opened his clinic for us on his day off! I mean who does that? He gave us instructions to care for the tooth, we made a follow up appointment, and left. Needless to say..our sons tooth looks great. It actually straightened out almost back to its original spot. We went to our follow up appointment and got the good news that his teeth looked great and to just keep a watch on it.

So I go back up there to have it filled. The dentist said out loud, \"why did I do that?\" Which lets me know he messed up. While he was sticking needles in my mouth to numb everything, which never got numb, he hit one of my top teeth with the needle and made a hole. The whole procedure was so incredibly painful and they just kept going. So now I have to get that hole fixed plus the tooth he put a deep hole in then filled, it still hurts. Also while drilling he hit so many surrounding teeth with the drill, made punctures and grooves in teeth that are now sensitive.  I can't chew  anything even a little bit crunchy on the right side of my mouth.  When I called asking for a refund nobody ever got back with me and they feel like they did everything right.
