Get a sandwich, drink, and a bag of chips for $5. It's better than subway hands down. They've also got bubble tea but these may be commercial and not made there. I'm not sure because I've never had one, it's not really my thing. I've had their Spring Rolls and was impressed. The workers are really nice and friendly. Restaurant is a little small but I usually grab something to go. Also it's clean which isn't always a big deal but for me it is.\n\nGive it a shot and I know you'll not regret it.

They know what they are doing and I very highly recommend checking them out. With extremely positive word-of-mouth and online reviews, chances are you will LOVE this place as much as I did if you are looking to try out some new and interesting food that will hopefully blow both your mind and your taste buds without breaking your bank.\n\nI heard about these friendly folks and their amazingly delicious sandwiches a few years ago back when they were operating out of a food truck setup at a gas station. For some reason I never gave them shot, and now I highly regret only just recently getting around to trying it out because of all the times in the past couple years that I could have thrown down a couple bucks for one of these delectable flavor bombs instead of wasting money on all the typical and usually regrettable fast food.\n\nI stumbled across these guys again the other day online and all the positive reviews out there just confirmed what I had heard before and got me and my wife through their door that very same day. They now operate out of a small but pleasant little shop in a standard shopping center. My wife and I ordered and split the Banh Mi \"Special\" and the Grilled Pork sandwiches, Shrimp and Pork spring rolls, with a Mango Bubble Tea. Everything was almost shockingly tasty, the flavors were fresh, crisp, clean, savory, bold, balanced, and just straight up delicious. The service was super quick and the young couple that owns it were kind and happy people genuinely looking to make sure we enjoyed everything and had everything we needed. Lastly, this place is CHEAP...unbelievably cheap for the quality and portion-size. Simply cannot be beat. I was compelled to add an online review myself considering how much I enjoyed it.\n\nWe will for sure be back, and if you have not been yet, do yourself a favor and go there as soon as you are hungry. Today if possible. If you are hungry at this very moment. Go there now. Seriously.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e99d8972a1:0x908769bd353f6d75"}
