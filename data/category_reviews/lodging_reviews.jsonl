Seldom heard a noise in the hallway or connecting rooms even though it was very busy (noises seemed to be insulated well). Swimming pool was busy with young kids most of the time, hot tub was closed or broke. Elevators always smelled clean but needed to be swept more often by staff (kids and adults constantly tracked sand in them). Bartenders by the pool were friendly. Easy access to the beach. Chairs and umbrellas available for rental by an outside company but didn't have any trouble using our own stuff. Hotel provides beach towels for guests at the front desk but they are thin and old. The hotel is located right next door to the public beach access which honestly made it seem less busy than some of the beach areas outside the larger condos and hotels. The beach outside this hotel never seemed over crowded. Breakfast in the morning had lots of options and tasted good. It was self-service buffet style while we were there. Employees wore masks but it was optional for guests. We always felt safe and comfortable. Honestly, we did have a nice stay. This hotel is VERY expensive for the services provided.

Make sure you get to a restaurant by 4pm(3:30 is best) or you may not eat. Pizza delivery is a 2-3 hour wait...unless they run out of dough- yes, that happened. I'm not at all blaming the restaurants, they're doing all they can with what they have. It's just a circumstance you'll have to  deal with. Every. Single. Establishment is hiring. I do feel for them. Also pick at least 3 restaurants to head to because the 1st 3 just may be closed for lack of employees. There are too many people to accommodate everyone when all of the hotels are full. You take your life in your hands when driving.\nNow let's talk about the beautiful Gulf water. Full of June Grass-look it up, it's disgusting, sticks to your skin, gets stuck in your bathing suit and stinks.\nSo August 17th -24th the gulf was not beautiful or blueish green,  It was thick and gross.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07be600ccac1:0x6afd03e85865fb22"}

I've been here for 6 months August 2018 and have experienced things I thought I would never experience. My first few months there was gunshots almost every night which I'm not used to so imagine staying somewhere sleeping and then hearing that and having to run get your child for safety! During my moving day, the apartment was a mess. The front door looked like someone kicked the door in and it took maintenance a month to just put wood filler and paint on the door and door frame instead of replacing it. The apartment was roach infested which I am not immune to so I was extremely on edge seeing the roaches were in the apartment and gnats taking over the kitchen. Their pest control did not resolve the issue at all. It took for me to buy over $30 worth of pest control products at Lowe's which helped a lot! The main light in the kitchen was not working and it took maintenance a month to switch it out so I was cooking and cleaning using the counter light because I refused to spend my own money on something they should be doing and still have to pay rent. Then, all the plugs in the living/dining room except for 2 is not working and 1 in my son bedroom is not working and maintenance have not come to resolve that issue till this day 02/28/19. The closet doors have been dislocated in all bedrooms and hall since I moved in and no one came to fix it till this day 02/28/19. The bathtub is peeling, you can't take a hot shower for more than 2 minutes nor run bath water because the water gets cold immediately so since I moved into this apartment my son have not taken any bathes just showers and he's 2! The balcony floor is unleveled and some of the wood is protruding out as well as nails which are dangerous for my son. When it rains, a blockage in the gutter causes the water to overflow and wet my nice patio furniture and do more damage to the wooden balcony floor. The water is free however but Alabama Power left notices on all the tenant's doors stating that the water was going to be turned off in 30 days due to nonpayments. I called trying to see when do I need to go up to AP to have water in my name or see what is going like the rest of the tenants did. The water didn\u2019t cut off but it just shows they are not professional and not handling what they need to.\nI just had to save the best for last. They have misplaced my money order for a month and informed me on the day that I was turning my current month rent in that I have to pay $650 for a mistake they caused especially since I showed some type of proof that the money was taken out of my account. Employee Tammy/Kammy got sassy after I told her that they need to figure it out without having an attitude and so she called me rude. Not professional. Then the \u201carea manager\" for Onyx at 600 Mark Sanders was not professional. He continued to repeat the same thing over and over as if I was obtuse, unintelligent, and uncomprehending on the process that I needed to do to track a money order that they misplaced even though I do not and currently have not located the money order number receipt due to either misplacing or throwing it away which come to find out I couldn\u2019t find most of my receipts from previous payments. When I felt like he was insulting my intelligence then I had to step out of character, say my peace without cursing and not calling names, and hang up. He called back leaving an unprofessional voice message but I didn\u2019t call back instead I did what he said about going to the location where I got the money order and guess what? They said they do not have access to track MoneyGram without the number and there is no form to fill out.  If I missed a payment on a month then the professional way of doing things is providing a notice to have proof on the company end that an employee gave a notice regarding nonpayment especially since I have NEVER missed a payment. Why would I come in the office making payment for the current month and not the previous month? I will not be renewing lease.

If youre late on rebt they charge you an ADDITIONAL $150 on top of the rent.  It's not the most convenient to places or interstate,  but again the price is right.  Some good neighbors, mostly ghetto folk, NO POOL and people get shot at on a regular basis.  The entertainment factor of watching and listening to good fights is like a 9 on a ten scale.  Not lit very well and you really want to check your place prior to move in.  Someone was murdered in my apartment 2 months before i moved in..... Found it out from the neighbors and doing an internet search.  Upside of that is everything was replaced with new.  Roughly $90 a month power bill.  And the office will work with you if you are slightly tardy with rent or don't have the best credit.  If they kept the place lit up better,  the drug activity would go down.  Over all not a bad place.  Just lock your stuff up and try to make your building the best it can be by replacing bulbs and knowing your neighbors. Don't expect maintenance to do anything or a smile from the office staff when you go in to pay rent or complain that the apartment below you stinks and the items that the maintenance people threw out is disgusting and drawing bugs into other apartments.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzG7BiGG8LCBfLTzpSdsqTECrNO3iFH_NQVQJ8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc_P-hVd7zMjBWYAeQVjdy6euLuIYLyjK1obb6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOVOd1v5gitppituKA8Ef5Xaqc7_nxWKi8G942=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890e8926913ee3:0x712891a28e99f6fe"}

Which is still too generous...  On 4/19/2019, I applied for an apartment at The Onyx at 600 and was approved. On 4/24/2019, I paid a $350 Administrative Fee. I asked Imani if I could sign my lease and see my apartment that day. She showed me a \u201cdemo apartment\u201d and told me that their office only does lease signings on Fridays. She told me that I could come back on 5/3/2019 to see my actual apartment and then sign my lease. I returned on 5/3/2019, Imani was not there. I asked the young pregnant woman who would not give me her name if there was someone there who could show me my apartment and allow me to sign my lease. She told me that a woman by the name of Cami was \u201con site\u201d and was the only other person who could allow me to sign my lease. I asked her to call Cami and she told me that she had no way to contact her. I asked her, \u201cSo if there was an emergency that you could not handle, what would you do?\u201d She called Imani and asked Imani where my lease was because she could not find it. Then she told me that I could go ahead and pay my first month rent and come back later. I told her that I would NOT pay anything as I had not seen my actual apartment and I did not have a lease ready to sign. As I continued to wait for Cami to come back into the office, another woman came in, stated that she too was supposed to move in that day but her apartment was not ready because her dishwasher was in her living room, her cabinets did not have any hardware, there was a hole in her wall, and her bathroom did not have a door. At that point, I told the young pregnant woman that I was leaving and would return for my $350 Admin fee. After I left, Cami called me and told me that she would not give me my $350 back because it was non-refundable and that was to hold the apartment. . I NEVER saw MY actual apartment, no one ever produced a lease for me to sign, there is nothing in their brochure, the paperwork emailed to me, nor on their website that states or specifies that the Admin fee is \u201cnon-refundable\u201d.

The shower curtains had mold, the toilets had dried urine spots, there was a dirty towel left in one of the bathrooms. The bed sheets seemed clean, but are so old they have holes. The bath towels are old. The microwave has broken plastic, the dishwasher leaks. The couches are so old and worn, the arm rests are discolored. The carpet wasn\u2019t vacuumed, the tile in the kitchen has broken pieces with some grout missing.\n\nDavid Cohen came and tried to vacuum right under foot with all our kids here. Wasn\u2019t interested in seeing the issues. He was suppose to come the next day and clean while we were out, didn\u2019t show up. I hope they refund us some money at least for the cleaning fee.

Many windows are broken and need to be replaced interior doors need replacing, our 500.00 upgraded facet has leaked since the first week.

Now the whole front needs to come off. We were told a steel door would be installed on our safe room, still isn\u2019t installed. Forgot to add brick to a step up in garage workroom filled with cement instead. Master shower tile, bad workmanship. We are pulling two buckets of water from our basement in a dehumidifier we had to place there because of the moisture. Front sidewalk concrete at the entrance Is unacceptable. We were told at closing when we asked about punch list not being complete and should we delay closing the answer was we would be find a penalty for every day after closing date if we did.
