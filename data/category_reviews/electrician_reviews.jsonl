I wrote a check for the services. Them some women comes to the door asking me to re-wrote the check to a personal person because they couldn't cash it. Then when I asked for a receipt they said we don't have receipts today. Then when I thought ok something is not right here and called the office which was the dad he was in shock they asked for another check and had been told he didn't do anything....like I had not paid. Then he said let me see what is going on and I will call you back. He never calls back. The lady that I am pretty sure was on meth calls me back and says I won't charge when we come back. Well later that night my uncle has no hot water. They never turned the water heater back on. So that was a 125.00 extra charge from the plumber. It has been a total mess. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!

I contacted them to rewire a switch controlling one light and a ceiling fan (the light switch was working already but the ceiling fan was not).

In the process they disconnected several lines causing various lights, vents, fans, etc., throughout the home to quit working.  After three hours they quit, leaving hot electrical wires hanging out of the wall.  They returned the next day (three hours later than they agreed to arrive) and spent the entire day working on the wiring trying to determine why they had broken the circuit to the other locations.  After eight hours they \"finished\" and left -- with the switch they originally came to repair still not working.  After calling them the next day they sent another person who worked on the wiring and finally got the original switch working and the other outlets they had disconnected working but still did not ever get the ceiling fan working.  They then presented a bill for $85 for the original service call and $375 for the repair work they had to do to solve the other problems they created, and, the ceiling fan switch still does not work. $460 total for them to actually do nothing.  The switch that was working is still working, the circuits that were working before they disconnected them are still working as they were before McLeod arrived, and the ceiling fan still does not work.

Last year when a Hurricane blew through town, I had suffered roof damage along with many of my neighbors. Being fortunate and not actually displaced from my residence, I opted to wait a few months to solicit repair estimates while those who needed immediate help were being serviced.\n\nWhen the rush had died down (or so I thought), I reached out to multiple companies for estimates. I quickly realized that getting someone out to even give me an estimate was going to be a challenge. Numerous companies offered to come out but none actually followed through. Until I found Davis Roofing! They arrived within a few days at the precise time I was promised. A detailed professional estimate was provided to me and my insurance company for a complete roof replacement.\n\nUpon acceptance by my insurer, they asked me for my business.  At this point, they were the only company to respond. I took a chance with a single estimate, mostly because of promptness, professionalism and effective communication. I was not disappointed!\n\nDriving through my subdivision, I have the best roof in the neighborhood! The price I was quoted was the price that I paid. An addendum was even sent to my insurance company (by them) for additional expenses to be paid to me. That was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe efforts and communication of this group did not end when the job was over. I have been contacted multiple times over the last year with inquiries on my satisfaction. What more could I want? With this latest communication, I made mention of a single shingle that had slipped and looked crooked on the eve above my front door. The customer service representative promised to have the repair crew out to fix it. It happened the next day!\n\nFolks, I don't do many Google reviews. It takes a lot to impress me! Suffice to say, Restoration Services has done so and has earned my business going forward. I like the fact that they have expanded their offerings to include electrical services as well. I know they will be there, if needed. They will be my only call!

I have used both the A/C and Electric services from blevins. I want to say the Electrical side is top notch. I would give them a 5star rating.\n\nNow on the to A/C service. I ordered a whole house dehumidifier for my 2100SQft. home. I was told by aprilaire and another AC company that the aprilaire 1830 was the size I needed for my home. So I purchased the unit. Anthony  came out to install the unit.\nAfter the install the unit wasn't working as it should. The humidity wasn't coming down in the house. So I tried to work with Anthony to resolve the problem. He did call support for aprilaire. And after going talking with them they decided that the unit was undersized. The unit is a 70pint and should cover a 2800sqft. house. I wanted my humidity around 45 to 48 %.\nthis unit was only getting it  to 57%. that is what I started with , so it wasn't working at all.\n\nAfter talking with support myself. I was told that the unit needed to be installed per the recommended installation. Which is from return to return. It needs to work with the AC unit to achieve peak performance.\n\nAnthony installed it from return to supply. which I was told by aprilaire that causes a resistance from the supply air and the air coming from the dehumidifier. He did not install a drip pan under the dehumidifier.( he took the charge off for the drip pan) He used 12\" duct which isn't recommended. And added reducer down to the 10\" inlet\n\nSo I asked Anthony to install it per manufacture .  He straight out refused. I have a copy of the text and a lot of pictures to post. Also have an email from tech support stating the correct way to install is per the manual install glide.\n\nI added the correct duct work and put a drain pan under the dehumidifier and rerouted the drain line.\nThe Dehumidifier is work as should now humidity is around 47%.\nThe only thing I asked Anthony to do is install it the preferred method ( which is what he should have done in the beginning and we would not of had any problems)  and he refused.

Fran decided she wanted to save some money and buy a dehumidifier herself instead of purchasing one through an authorized dealer. She asked us to install it which we did by the manufacturer requirements. Her humidity is already down to 50-55% in the home but she insist that it must go lower. We tried to help her resolve this issue for a week. After contacting the manufacturer and going over our installation in detail to make sure it was no error on our part it was determined that Fran had purchased the wrong size unit to fit her home. The following is from Aprilaire contractor tech support.\n\nUnit is undersized for the space and you would be lucky to reach 50% with an 1830. If you want to go to 40%, you would need at least an 1870.

Well, the A C didn't come on so I called American Home Warranty which provided me with my info and called Same Day maintenance (cause I've used them before to install a thermostat in my home), the technician came out flipped the switch on and never went outback to check my unit...naturally I was happy because now I'm knowing I have air. Kept my doors and windows opened and up until around7:30 because it was really hot inside and I didn't want the unit to work as hard cooling the house inside. 3:00 before day Saturday morning; I was drenched in sweat.not understanding what's happened, got up, checked the A C inside..on. Went out back, checked the unit..no fan turning, unit very hot..turned off A C inside, called SameDay around 8:00 that morning, left emergency message..no return called. Called again all day every30 minutes- an hour...no phone call. Same repeat for Sunday. Monday morning I was on the phone calling them from7:30 until the answering machine picked up and I asked them to please call me back..didn't call me, I called back again finally getting someone who told me they would check with the tec. to see when he can come b out( mind you, this is a re-call) so I should have been a priority along with other people who had an emergency over the week-end not wait until Wednesday to try and work me in. I was told Wednesday morning that the Tec. would be out between 1and 5pm. Okay... I'm trying to hold my self in check because now I'm feeling disrespected and ignored. 4:35 no Tech..I called their office back after the 2nd phone call I was told this guy name Andy would give me a call...what???\nIt's already4:55 I said\" call me\" he should be here by now i2don't need him to call me.. She said\" that's what he told me to tell you\" . long story....so he called5:10 said he would look at his schedule and see if he could get to me tomorrow( Thursday)....I'm sooo pissed now, hot and disgusted...called American Residential warranty back, explained this same thing to them and told them I will not use Same Day Maintenance anymore and to place that notation on the computer by my name...so now I'm searching the internet trying to find someone else who will come out asap to get me up and running......I recommend no body uses this service...at all.

So I stopped in at Univeristy Electric on Monday and talked to them about this. They were so nice and said they would be glad to come out and fix it. That they would put us on the wait list and call when they had an opening. Tuesday morning at 8:15am I got a call from them that they could come out this morning if it was ok with us. Wow, that was fast. So Thomas came out to see what needed to be done to fix the issue, got the right stuff, spent a couple of hours running a new line and fixed our issue. Thomas was very nice, friendly and professional. He checked several other things dealing with the phone connection. He made sure we were happy with everything and also made us aware of other services that available through his company. So have no doubts we will definitely use them again!!

So I called several HVAC companies, and I quickly found out that the repair cost was high enough that I was better off getting a new air conditioning system. So I did some research, and then I got quotes from 11 different companies. Of the price range of quotes, Xcalibur was among the lowest. So I chose Xcalibur, and the next morning, Ryan, Mark, Jacob and Zachary showed up and installed a new air conditioning system and furnace (I actually didn't need a new furnace, but the extra cost to add a new furnace to the a/c installation job was low.).  The installation guys were professional (for example, they put on shoe covers before entering my house) and knowledgeable.\n\nI'm glad that I chose this company. First, Ben and Ryan are actually honest people. Also, Ben and his employees seem to take pride in doing a good job.  My new a/c system not only comes with the standard 10 year warranty for parts, but also a 10 year warranty for LABOR.  Call other HVAC companies yourself and ask if they include a 10 year labor warranty on a/c installations.  When they say no, ask them what the labor cost is to replace a compressor or an evaporator coil.  Also, Xcalibur installed new line sets with my a/c system. But some HVAC companies cut corners by not installing new line sets.\n\nSince Alabama Power is my electricity company, I can track my electricity usage via Alabama Power's website or their app. My new Bryant a/c system uses about 39% less kilowatts than the American Standard system that it replaced.  In just the first month of using this Bryant a/c system, I saved over $100 on my Alabama Power bill!  I also found out that Bryant equipment and Carrier equipment come out of the same factories because they are sister companies.\n\nIf I could give Xcalibur 6 stars, I would. But Google only allows me to give 5 stars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88896cd0e3c3ffff:0xed4091d744266bb9"}

I was extremely pleased with the service I received.  Tommy Oswalt came out and did an initial site assessment and gave me a very realistic look at all the work necessary and the expense involved.\n\nOnce the generator arrived, technicians Ben House, Eric Gray and Colby Winham came out to pour a pad on the slope beside my house.   Because of the steep slope, they had to build a form to pour a slab for the generator to sit on.  Our generator was installed the next week and being in the service industry myself, I was very interested in each stage of the process.  The guys all did a fantastic job of making the installation look neat.  When Hoover inspectors came out to give their final inspection, it was apparent that they had worked with Capital Heating & Cooling often enough that they knew everything would be up to code and signed off on the job without a comment.\n\nAll the guys were very professional and did exceptional work.  The office staff also went out of their way to help make sure Spire followed through and installed a larger gas meter  (Thanks Laura)\n\nI could not give Capital Heating & Cooling a better review.

I am very happy with their work. They took the step of identifying that the original pvc piping used for the drain for the unit in the attic was not draining effectively (a worker in the attic poured a gallon of water into it while another worker in the garage observed and noted the water did not make it to the drain in the garage) and they corrected that, mounting fasteners in multiple places along the PVC pipe to ensure it sloped properly in its run across the attic, and they replaced the rusted overflow tray beneath the HVAC unit. They also eliminated the traps in the drains for both units, which is where algae would always build up; the traps were apparently redundant because both drains feed into a drain in the garage floor that has a trap beneath the concrete floor. They left straight cleanouts in place of the p-traps which should reduce algae buildup, and I can still pour vinegar or chlorine to reduce algae. The three workers, Bobby, Jason, and Matt seemed trustworthy and very competent. The installation looks really well-done.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNtZtWINf9Qz3pwUGmLBrONsriWNdjQ1M6r58E=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgujQlXd1z7Tnxc12p_Q1jtfShcq0ie9Db3P7p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889211833afed27:0x4ff4abb6cd4fbd2f"}

The quote was ambiguous, unspecific, and extremely overpriced. Also, I had to pay $29 for an on-site quote. Many electricians provide estimates over the phone. Make sure you get a second opinion before you go this route. You could be grossly overpaying.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622638909198, "text": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feedback with us.

(1st Red Flag)\n\nThe technician than began to start working while blaring music really loud, which was heard down the street for hours.\n\nThe technician told us that he likes listening to music while he works and did not care if we had a problem with it while laughing.  Within 15 minutes from the start, he barged into our house and said he could not perform the services that we all agreed upon for that rate.\n\nHe insisted that we pay additional funds to complete services.  We told him that we were not paying a penny more and that we were becoming irritated with him and the company. (2nd Red Flag)\n\nWe then told the technician that he could leave and we would have someone else come out and do the job for less.  The technician then became irate and started making verbal threats while laughing. (3rd Red Flag)\n\nFurthermore, we observed the technician through video surveillance trying to hide on the property while smoking cigarettes and throwing the butts on the ground.\n\nThe technician spent more time telling us how great his work would turn out versus just completing a job and leaving.  We clocked 4 1/2 hours for approximately 45 minutes of work.\n\nWe tried numerous times to run the technician off the property, but he kept wanting to talk.  He apparently wanted to hear himself speak.\n\nWe would never hire these guys to do any work and advise others to stay away from them. They overcharge their customers and are completely rude and unprofessional.  Apparently, we found out later that they hire individuals with criminal history.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563290779998, "text": "Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

I re-scheduled for 4 days later.\n\nAppointment #2: Appointment confirmation email stated that arrival window was between 12pm and 3pm. At 2:50pm, I got a call that stated that my technician probably would not be able to arrive until after 6pm. Unfortunately, that wouldn\u2019t work since I had to be at work at 5pm.\n\nUpdated review below and stars updated as well:\n\n3rd time, manager comes out to do the estimate. On time. So good. Schedule appointment for a few days later to do work. Also get an inconvenience discount.\n\n4th appointment (work day): appointment is for 9AM in the morning. Was called at 9AM stating, again, like the first missed appointment, that they were dealing with \u201cemergencies\u201d so they would be unable to get to me until that afternoon.\n\nCall Mr Sparky corporate and speak to more upper management. Get an additional $200 something dollars off the job and they show up at about 430pm with 4 guys.\n\nIn about 5 hours, they set and wired 4 recessed lights, hung several light fixtures replaced an outlet, and replaced 3 breakers.\n\nI\u2019ll say this about Mr Sparky, the electricians they have seem to be highly competent at what they do. It looks like they do quality work.\n\nHowever, they are very focused on \u201cselling\u201d jobs and that\u2019s where they make their money. So you have to be careful about getting talked into things you may not really need ie: whole house surge protection, etc...it\u2019s also what gets them behind. They will show up at one job, and get up sells, so a 30 minute call can turn into a 2 hour call due to the upsells.\n\nSummary: seems to be quality electricians that do quality work, however, they did not show up at 2 of my appointments and were 7 hours late to a third, so staffing and corporate policies and focus look to be issues.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1544018013037, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to bring this concern to our attention.

As a subcontractor for our builder, A-1 Electric failed to complete items found during our final walk through inspection and close of our home on 29 January 2021. The following electrical items were found incomplete at our final walkthrough and documented on the 30 OT for follow-up for A-1 Electric to come back and complete these items within 30 days, 2 Mar 2021: 2BR vanity light and 2 ring door bells that were never wired; and 3 dimmer switches which were not installed for our kitchen canned lights per contract. Since moving into our home, we have discovered the patio fan was not wired, a socket was not installed in the 2BR, there are visible sparks from the hall closet switch when we turn it off and on, the GFI for the laundry room which has a sink was placed on the opposite side of the garage, and our canned lights in the master bedroom flicker when we turn the fan off and on (watch 10 sec video where canned lights flicker when using the fan switch). Now, since moving into our home we have had light fixtures replaced by another electrician for areas not related to the aforementioned. The construction manager on site relayed this back to A-1 Electric that he witnessed another electrician in our home and made assumptions and even went so far as to running the hired electrician down in his vehicle to see what this hired electrician had done in our home. Because of this, A-1 Electric voided our 1 year warranty without completing the work they left undone in the first place. At no time were we told, verbally or in writing, by the prime, subcontractor or the construction manager that we had to wait until A-1 Electric completed their unfinished work they hadn't done, and items the construction manager failed to catch prior to us closing on the home-- that we couldn't have light fixtures changed out. Furthermore, after we went to the prime we were told they were not able to get anything in writing from A-1 Electric concerning voiding our warranty for this cause either. If they were to produce a document now, it would be to cover themselves because of this review. A-1 Electric should be held accountable and reprimanded for trying to negate their responsibility to finish a job that was identified up front for them to complete instead of making up a loop hole based on the construction manager's assumptions. If the construction manager was doing his job he wouldn't be flagging down another electrician to inquire about the failed work he, as, the construction manager and having oversight of A-1 electric didn't do! If he put that same energy in doing his job then he would be more confident in the end product and not run people down in the street. The hired electrician could have been my brother or family friend who happened to work for an electrical company. I would not recommend this company and as a 20 year War Veteran have a mind to initiate everyone that I know across this nation to post this exact review on my behalf...", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJQ6-FKs7qXJiefUTpWVOy_cxNQqkzUO7Krhq7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268c2b23af33d:0x83bd81dc073ba25d"}

Has been so great I could never say enough about him. A really nice man too I got know well as I was out there with him showing me what was wrong and needed. So where would I be now without Travis. Another person or new gutters? First day he came I was horrified what he found. Asked him do I just need new gutters again, was worried then about the whole house. He said no, he was repairing them, I needed to see what was wrong, those areas. Travis saved me a lot money and stress I have been through with the thought of new gutters and couldn\u2019t be repaired. I will always use him.\nI see now here too maybe he can clean them.

This story takes place in the relatively small parking lot of the hotel I am staying in.\n\nBefore we get started though, know that I tried to resolve this issue directly with the company. The responses I received from them began with a man named \"Andrew\" responding to my initial email with \"who the heck is this\".\n\nIn the attached pictures you will see what their workers did. Things the company clearly considers acceptable, because their attitude towards the situation was condescending at best.\n\nThing #1: You'll see 3 trailers here. One is a different company, one is Scott's Services (the middle one) and one is unmarked. It's not easy to see how many spots they are taking up, but at least 6.\n\nThe drivers were there, and were aware of the problems they were causing. People were actively driving around the lot trying to find parking spots. You can also see the company name on the truck here.\n\nThere is another truck here that is apparently also theirs. After the front desk agent of the hotel asked them to stop blocking parking spaces, they refused, claiming they were stuck. After the agent left they had a good laugh about it, and then moved into the unmarked truck.\n\nThing #2: This is the other side of the parking lot. Another of their vehicles. A much smaller vehicle. One capable of fitting into a single space, and yet they managed to take up two with this one as well. Surely this truck was not stuck as well. What stopped them from fixing this one and freeing up a space?\n\nUpon reporting this behavior to the company, I was told by the person named Andrew that I had a personal problem, and that the hotel should deal with the issue if they feel they need to. I should also stop trying to get hard working people in trouble just because I cannot park where I want. Because everyone knows only Scott's Services' workers are hard working - none of the other patrons of the hotel they inconvenienced were hard working people as well.\n\nIn the adult world we do not get \"in trouble\"; We get held accountable for our actions. The company's refusal to hold their employees accountable for their behavior is a clear declaration that the behavior is condoned by the company, and that these actions accurately reflect the values of Scott's Services.\n\nConsider these things when you consider working with them. This is how they might choose to behave.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNotWXTHDswMaStIri7oO1KYTHcdDg-iMZM7EcH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIccL5azPhSQVorayMuH0fSQ-MeP3tLWdwfrfu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYlAUxH76tGUHIMWgqp0OIhoIpA1rtx96Fa9j5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890d91da79e17f:0xb7995bed26179105"}

Bass wasn't quite the lowest bid but got the work because of the previous experience I had.\nSam worked with me through several revisions of quotation as I tweaked a request or two. I appreciated Sam's attention to getting the scope clearly identified before any work began. Bass coordinated with Alabama Power for dropping and re-connection of the service, as well as with Auburn's Code Enforcement department for permitting and inspection.\nJosh, Levi, Aaron, and Travis arrived on time and we talked through the job. They seemed to have a good understanding of the scope. The two teams worked smoothly and efficiently to get the job done. They were courteous, friendly, and quick to answer any questions I had along the way. They also had a few questions for me and I appreciated them allowing my input. They started about 8 AM and finished just after 3 PM.

I do not have the capability or knowledge to update the unit and couple that with another spine issue preventing me from the physical aspect of the task- it was the logical choice to call the folks that sold me the unit.   I was told that if more than a year passed without them performing a service that I would pay an additional $198 on top of the $289 service.  After receiving over $5000 from my family for a 22kw Generac generator installation they have the nerve to charge what I see as a penalty of $198 because I didn\u2019t use their services every year.

They arrived, placed a pad and installed the generator.  The guy who seemed to be in charge said that they had checked the generator and it was good to go.  My wife and I discovered that the green light, indicating that the generator was functional, was not on.  A red light was on.  This was at 11:30pm at night.  It wasn't running or doing anything weird, so I called the Generac corp. office and a man there told me how to turn the generator off.  I did such and the next day, I called CES to inform them of the problem.  I had to tell my story to three different people.  THEN they said that the owner would have to talk to me to get an 'OK' for a service call.(?)  So, I called him and he proceeded to criticize how I had handled the situation.  I didn't want to call someone out in the middle of the night for, what appeared to be a non emergency problem.  He finally okayed a tech to come out.  The tech could not find anything wrong after a 'thorough and complete' exam.\nAbout 10 days later, my wife and I were out in the yard and we heard a very loud clang sound.  Repeatedly , a harsh noise seemed to be coming from the transfer switch that goes  to the generator.   We called CES and had to tell our story to three people again and, as it was 4:30pm, we finally were referred to \"Buddie\", who said that everyone had gone home for the day.  This was their response to what sounded like a very damaging situation occurring.  I demanded to talk to the owner.  He called again and criticized me again for how I had handled the situation.  He also was abusive about how I had spoken to his employees.  The best defense is, apparently, still a good offense.  So, I went on defense reflexively.  I just wanted the machine to be fixed.  He said that it was the Huntsville Utilities problem.  He said, reluctantly, that he would call back a tech who lived in Guntersville to make a service call.  I called HU and they had no complaints of outages.  I also checked with both neighbors, who had no problem.  At this  point, the HU tech came out and he said that everything on the electrical service was in good working order.  The technician from CES arrived and examined the generator. He said that he had never seen anything like this problem before.  GREAT!!   So, he increased the idle time between my service going out and the generator startup. His parting words were that he would call Generac and find out what the problem was and would call me.  RIGHT!!   At this juncture I had had enough of CES and I transferred my warranty to Mr. Electric.  Days later the same scenario occurred with harsh clashing sounds coming from the transfer switch.   I called Mr. Electric and one person handled the problem and sent out a service tech.  He discovered that two color-coded wires had been installed to the wrong color-coded positions, rendering the machine sensing low wattage coming into my house from HU.  He took pictures of the situation and re installed the correct color wire to the correct color position and the problem was solved.  He asked if the CES techs had performed a post installation check on the generator, because this incorrect wiring pattern would have been discovered if CES had done a post installation check.  I told him that the CES guy told me that they had done the check up.  EVIDENTLY NOT!!!  He showed me the reading on the machine with the crossed wires was stimulating the generator to turn on.  The wattage read on the LED was low.  He fixed this problem and looked the entire installation over.  I have to give at least one star to CES in order to get this posted, so  one star to CES for having a pulse.  Five stars to Mr. Electric.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88627356036de3a3:0xcf111e024483c90c"}

There is nothing more aggravating than to have your air conditioning unit quit. Although it is mid-October we needed our air conditioning fixed ASAP.

I emailed a few companies Saturday night asking for estimates and to please contact me Monday morning. Only Autumn Air and one other company returned my call today. Autumn Air was very pleasant and offered to have someone come out to price the unit immediately. Since I knew I did not want to start throwing money away repairing such an old unit I asked for a quote for a new unit (with and without the furnace). Skip came out and priced the unit with three options and it was clear if I wanted more options he would give them to me. He did not acted putout or frustrated with my request. He did not pressure me to make a decision nor did he push me to buy the most expensive product. Without me asking, he let me know the specials that were being offered. I asked how soon they could install the unit and he said either this afternoon or in the morning. I called my husband and sent him the estimates. My husband was impressed and even showed his fellow employees who were also impressed with the prices. After weighing the pros and cons we decided to replace the entire unit (with furnace). I called Skip back about 2:30 saying we did want to go ahead and replace the unit, he said he would call me right back, that it would be either this afternoon or in the morning. I was floored when he called me back shortly afterwards and asked if it was okay with me if they could install it today. Skip and two other gentlemen came and installed the unit working hard until close to 9:00 pm. We were all extremely grateful to the diligence of these men. In addition, Autumn Air included a 2-year service plan where they will come out to service/clean the unit twice a year. They have earned my trust.

Even a few of the vent registers had started harboring mold growth which was a really bad sign as well.\n\nSo, I did what any good panicking homeowner would do at that point. Went to Google, pulled up nearby HVAC companies with good reviews that could do duct replacement, and called for appointments for onsite inspections. Out of the four highly reviewed and reputable companies (minus individual contractors) in the Pelham area that actually showed up for their appointment, Autumn Air's rep Baker was the only one who showed up on time, actually visually inspected inside the ductwork even after I showed him the initial pictures I took, and then spent a solid amount of time explaining to me options for replacing the entire ductwork system so we could see about what would be right for our budget. In the end, the price that Autumn Air was able to provide for an upgrade to a new round smooth metal interior and outside insulated wrapped system, including new boots and registers, throughout the entire house, plus a new central AprilAire Space Guard filtration and iWave-R GPS ionization system upgrade (per my request) beat out the one other company who actually sent me a quote by almost half. Let me say that again differently...TWO of the four companies NEVER sent back a quote. This told me that two of the highly reputable companies in the Pelham area that have a high amount of favorable reviews simply did not want a job. Pitiful for them.\n\nFast forward to the install a week later...Led by two guys named Javy and Charles, they took care of making sure everything was treated with care when taking out the old ductwork so as to minimize spreading of dirt and mold as much as could be. Then, they proceeded to assemble and install all of the new system on site for custom fitting plus making sure all seams were taped properly and coated with mastic so that the chances of air leaks past the coils is forever kept at a minimum. They arrived early in the morning, and worked until the job was finished that evening (on the day of Harvey storms coming through too!).  Any questions I had concerning anything with the job was answered and explained with no hesitation on their part.  They went beyond expectations with accommodations and I just can't be any happier.\n\nI can't say it enough in this entire description here how great Autumn Air is for an HVAC company. They want someone's business in the best way because they give the work the best service they can at reasonable prices, and offer great financing options too if needed. They understand how to go the extra mile to make sure the customer is being taken care of in the end as well. I can say I have also had the pleasure of meeting Jeff, the owner, later when he came back to look at a minor issue that crept up post install, and he is just as awesome about discussing more than the \"here's what we'll do\". He takes the time to explain the why and how's (if you are interested to know and ask) and will work with you as a customer to do everything he can within reason to make sure you are satisfied with him and his company. Because of all of these things described about everyone at that company and how we were treated, we now not only have clean, sanitized fresh air, but the confidence to know it will stay that way due to the complete service and professionalism we got from Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMabAWy162GH96gyl3m37sUEbn3lZkhH_QMnw5p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_X0ScvBCZDov4a77tJ8--jNZxa4SLKPRwf7ZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2_SRCsbshQYMwunCW_Svt09o-TDruxZ8tozW8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKpjJ6ZJSD3l76fC4DaZ5moDrfqENk5DrC3V5m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVryaFeSx9Ipmsmn5UNXwMOBC9HZqnM-6Io7MO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532681755, "text": "Thank you for sharing your review of our company!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

You get a discount on all service  after you sign up !\nReally, $120 a year for the PM plan  ?? i thought he misquoted so I jumped on it but its for real ! Great service, great guy. You rock Corey !

My existing furnace kept cutting off in the mornings, but then it ran fine for most of the day.

Instead of changing a bunch of things or applying \"band-aids\", they worked hard to pinpoint the true issue.

So a tiny faulty limit had to be found, and they found it.\n\nIt took a lot of patience and tedious work at times.

Most of my experiences with contractors on the Eastern Shore have been pretty mediocre at best.   OnTime Service was a refreshing change.   They are a well established Birmingham based company that just recently branched out to Baldwin County.

I went to Home Depot and purchased a new three-way switch but upon pulling the old switch out of the wall I found an unusual wiring that I had never seen. The old switch had three wires vs. the new 4-wire switch and the old switch had the green ground wire connected to a \"Red\" wire. Not wanting to take a chance of burning down my house I took the advise of my friend and called Mr. Electric. They were at my house and had the new switch in within three hours. Although people might feel their price was high, you get dedicated/trained electricians, insured and bonded. I'm willing to pay for that.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481386074577, "text": "Mr Irvin\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and for choosing Mr Electric.\nIt's such a privledge to work with customers such as yourself!\nDan Black\nMr Electric of Montgomery."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bb791c8ab23:0x5f513be338b68dcb"}

The workmanship of Steven Leavins was simply marvelous and very professional done. I selected Mr. Electric over Dixie Electric, McGehee Electric and R&H Electric for the following reasons:\n\u2022\tThe survey technician, Steven Leavins, was friendly and conducted a fairly thorough survey of the work to be done. This is important because it prevents rework and unnecessary delays in completing the work.\n\u2022\tTheir estimate was very detail, well structured, and nicely presented. Usually, how the presentation (in this case documentation) is delivered reflects the quality of workmanship you can expect.\n\u2022\tQuick response/reply. Mr. Electric responded to my initial query within hours as was your estimate. The other companies took 1-2 days to provide an estimate. This is impressive given the nice job done on the estimate.\n\nI was not disappointed in my choice. Steven Leavins was awesome! His work, attitude, and self-pride are worthy of acknowledgement. I'm not easy to please, but Mr. Electric and the team (namely Steven) delivered as promised and as I expected. Really, if you want some electric work done call Mr. Electric first. Oh, yeah, the company is very reasonable. I promise you will love the workmanship (and the people).", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1506708825540, "text": "Mr F, (Sleep Walker)\n\nYou made our day with this glowing review!
