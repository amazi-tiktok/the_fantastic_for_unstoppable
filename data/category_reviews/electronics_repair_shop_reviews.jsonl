By the time I got off work, it was 7:45, and all other phone repair shops in town were closed. It's Veterans Day weekend which means a lot of places are closed for the next day or two. Thank god Cellairis was open. I called and asked for an estimate before going and asked about a student discount and screen protector. Shyna gave me an incredible deal for calling that made this struggling college student feel sooooooo much better. And when there was confusion between what Shyna told me on the phone and what I was told in one store (since there are two locations in the mall, Shyna's deal was honored!! One of the things they test for after fixing a phone wasn't met when I came to pick up my phone, and Shyna worked on my phone well past their closing hours and tested it until it met their standards. Rachel stayed to help out as well and make sure everything went well and I was satisfied. They both were very kind, and they both were so very helpful! They also talked to me like a normal person and explained what they were doing when I asked, and they were very friendly. It's been a while since I have had service that nice!

By the time I got off work, it was 7:45, and all other phone repair shops in town were closed. It's Veterans Day weekend which means a lot of places are closed for the next day or two. Thank god Cellairis was open. I called and asked for an estimate before going and asked about a student discount and screen protector. Shyna gave me an incredible deal for calling that made this struggling college student feel sooooooo much better. And when there was confusion between what Shyna told me on the phone and what I was told in one store (since there are two locations in the mall, Shyna's deal was honored!! One of the things they test for after fixing a phone wasn't met when I came to pick up my phone, and Shyna worked on my phone well past their closing hours and tested it until it met their standards. Rachel stayed to help out as well and make sure everything went well and I was satisfied. They both were very kind, and they both were so very helpful! They also talked to me like a normal person and explained what they were doing when I asked, and they were very friendly. It's been a while since I have had service that nice!

Found this place and decided to give it a try. They had to order my screen and we paid in advance. Asked about insurance, which we don't have on my phone because I've never broken any of my phones. The guy at the counter kept commenting on how expensive it was going to be.... okay, so?... I want my phone fixed and your business does this right...?\n\nWe paid and were told it would take 3 to 5 days for the screen to come in; they would call me and I could come in and have the phone's screen replaced in an hour or so. 10 days pass and no one calls me. My husband calls them and they say the screen is in and I can come in and get it replaced. They then try to call me, but I was unavailable. The next day, he drops the phone off as soon as they open at 10am, and was informed that the only one who could fix it wasn't there yet. He would be there in 45mins and it would take 2hrs to fix the screen. 2 hrs....\n\nMy husband decided to go to the gym, then come home and clean up. He called them at 2pm and my phone was still being worked on: they said give him more time. He arrived there after 3:30pm and the phone was not finished being repaired. Decided to pick up dinner next door. Still not done. So finally, around 4pm it is finished. It works and has a lifetime warranty for the pressure sensitivity. This was one thing I was concerned about: the screen's pressure sensitivity.\n\nI get my phone and inspect it. It was not even sealed properly! Therefore, it is not waterproof anymore, and not resellable. Annoyed, I go to the shop myself and the tech who worked on my phone is very apologetic, admits it was done incorrectly, but is unable to help me. He said he was busy and trying to hurry because my husband had been waiting for a while. Still has a lot of things to work on; I could leave it overnight, come by tomorrow. Maybe it would get done. I can't leave my phone there overnight, and I can't come back the next day. He was going to try and put weight on the phone before taking the screen off and resealing it.\n\nThat is what I'm trying to do now: put weight on it. I wrapped it in screen cleaning cloths and set a gallon water jug on it. About 7 or 8 lbs. I asked him how much weight, but he never answered me, telling me instead about the warranty. The warranty is for the screen's pressure sensitivity.\n\nI'd rather have it take a long time and done correctly, than rushed and crappy. Now, I'm trying to correctly their mistake. I don't think pressing it down with weight will help. It is misaligned somewhere, and not glued and seal properly.\n\nPaid $340 to have my phone's screen replaced and they didn't do it properly. The back part is spongy; you press down and it comes back up. The whole left side was not placed correctly or glued down properly. Would never go here again. And would urge everyone to not waste their time until the people at CPR have better organization and attention to detail. They also seem like they need more knowledgeable people. My husband was told this tech had never worked on a Samsung Note 8 and that one of them only works on computers and laptops; no phones at all.

I was advised instead to purchase a wireless charger elsewhere and a battery from them since mine was weak. I did buy the battery from them and they came from the back with a battery that had no seal or package and sold it to me for $40 and took my old battery, which it would not charge past 20% until I bought a new battery from another location indicating they sold me a used battery as new. What they didn't inform me was that my phone was not wireless charging capable. I went back to try and get a refund but I was never given a receipt and they said they can't do anything about it since they have no records of them selling it to me. Not only am I now stuck with a used battery that was sold as a new but was given false information. I took my business to another phone repair shop that was capable of performing my repair at $65 compared to their quoted $200 and my screen never had to be shattered.

We would have been happy to explain why this is the way that it is.\n\nThe repair shop that you brought your device to has the capability of micro soldering a new charging port to the existing cable. We do not have that capability which means that we must remove the entire flex cable to change the port. The problem with that is the navigation buttons that are on the phone are sealed under the screen and wrap around to the charge port. Meaning for us to get those out we must lift the screen after heating it substantially. It\u2019s very risky and leads to cracked LCDs in most cases.\n\nWe NEVER want to take advantage of anyone. We set expectations for everything. We would rather you know the entire truth before going with our service.\n\nNow, to the battery. We buy batteries in bulk which do not come in \u201cretail\u201d packaging. We would have gladly given you a full refund on that item if it was not working up to our standards.\n\nAs you can see from most of our reviews, we go above and beyond for our customers. A $40 battery would not be worth losing a customer over.\n\nI will still gladly refund the $40 if you come in and ask for Jessie.\n\nAs I appreciate the feedback I believe a 1 star review isn\u2019t warranted in this case. We just lack the capabilities in making that specific repair cheaper.\n\nThe reality is the explanation you were given is 100% accurate because we would need to replace the screen as well which cost well over $100 just to get it to our shop.\n\nI am happy that you were able to get it fixed elsewhere and for cheaper. We cannot speak to other repair shops capabilities, only our own.\n\nThanks for your consideration and please come see us for your refund.\n\nJessie"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7349200629:0xa1f9cde73259baf4"}

I was blown away at the price so I decided to think on it. Shawn told me the part alone cost 50 dollars. I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue. Additionally I found the part on eBay new for less than 20 dolllars. Not to mention the fact that the diagnoses when they originally took it apart would have been an extra screw to replace the DC jack which he tried charging me another 100 bucks.

Terrible products (their brand) Good luck getting in touch with the manager. The reviews here must be from employees.\n\nI had a screen break. They fixed it. Took an incredibly long time. I walked around for a little while and the guy who started fixing my phone was texting his fingers off until I interrupted him to ask if he was done with my phone (Of course not). After getting my phone back and insisting on an Otter Box the employee (Ferris) convinced me that the glass screen protector he had could break, BUT IT WOULD SAVE THE PHONE'S SCREEN. He even showed me where it saved the store's IPad. Having a thinner phone than with the Otter Box had its appeals, I even bought a minimal case to be extra sure. After a week of babying my phone, I made the mistake of bending over with it in my front pocket (3ish ft fall). Glass protector and the screen shattered. I was pretty pissed.\n\nWent back to the store. New girl (Magen) seemed a little overwhelmed with helping other people so I was relatively nice to her. She told me that Ferris was promoted to manage his own store (watch out).I told her the story and asked for a refund of the defective glass screen and plastic case (both failed at doing their job and cost me another screen). She refused because she didn't have the authority. I asked to speak to the manager and she called him from her cell phone and walked outside (abandoned kiosk in the eastdale mall could have been costly) left me there and came back. Nope, the manager wouldn't do anything either, and I wasn't allowed to speak to him (STORE POLICY!!!!) She cut $10 off the new glass screen and gave me the managers email address.\n\nI am only writing this after attempting to contact the manager for the past two weeks(Chris Vick) I'm normally not the kind of guy that would do this. However, this business has terrible products that promote future phone screen replacements (kind of brilliant), have terrible customer service and even worse management.\n\n$400 taught me a valuable lesson about Cellairis...If I ever break my phone again, Ill support the Arabs a few kiosks down.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bd6bfae039f:0xfdc231c1c62d09d8"}

The tempered glass on my phone had a bit of an air bubble in it & it was replaced for me with one that fit my phone a bit better. \ud83d\ude0a", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0CN3mKGyoORm7qf8JcdF3UFLg1H8d8Yzq7td2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWZ-G7t1aktMkcgnoOeEXO6HpsVaCynTn83Ocj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBOVVIe6PuBxD9a9j2mwibUl8lvGqLNh_odq_a=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgAhnM1csE34B0doZEz67Jok20xWNwkXH_IbWv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTkjyLboBMpWyHMryYXVOFYiQ-hpONgYy3aYoO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ff853f5f4f:0x45b1b3ecbda7cd17"}

The first time they were able to help me was a few years ago. I dropped my phone and the screen was busted. I was able to leave it with them and have the repairs made. They paid the shipping, had it delivered because of my hectic work schedule. So that was definitely a huge plus.\nToday I was finally able to get in to have them look at my phone. Something was shaking around in the phone and it was driving me crazy.   They were able to open the phone up and put the correct adhesive on the battery which corrected the issue. They closed my phone up properly and I was on my way. Thankful to have a quality repair facility to take my phone to if it gives me trouble.\n\nIf I could give a second google review for this shop I would, and also give it another 5 star review! Since i can't leave 2 reviews, I thought I would edit the original and add on my experience. About a week ago I realized my phone screen that was already cracked, spread all across it, and it became unbearable to use. I googled and called the cell pro, they ordered me a replacement screen and I came in last Saturday to have it installed. Jason, had it swapped out before I could grab lunch and come back to pick it up. Later that day I notice that my screen unlock button wasnt unlocking my phone, all the time and I later realized that it was and just not getting bright enough. I called the store, wrote an email to the one they send you a receipt and notifications of your repair on, and messaged the Facebook page for the store. Late at night someone I assume to be the owner messaged me back on Facebook. Made arrangements for someone to come on Sunday to work around my schedule to check out the phone. Sunday came and I went to the store, Jason checked out my phone again did some things to it, and told me to keep an eye on it, bring it back if theres still trouble. Today Monday May 3rd 2021 I went back an explained to another employee that I realized it was unlocking it just not getting brighter. He offered to order another replacement screen and replace it, and mentioned it could be something else like a graphics card or other internals going bad. (I bought this phone in 2016) To my suprise after asking if they would consider returning my money for the screen and replacing the old screen into the phone, they did. With no questions asked. I figured it was time to chop off the thumb to save the hand and put that money towards a new phone.\n\nThese guys are not out to make a quick buck or rip anyone off, they have bent over backwards to help me twice, on two separate occasions. I greatly thank them for it. While I did lose the 45 dollar installation fee for the new screen (after I decided that's what I wanted), they worked on it three times and gave me my money back. While my phone is still messed up, it is just as messed up as before these guys helped me and it is at no fault to them.  While I hope I never need to repair any electronics they service, I know exactly where I will go if i ever need to. All things considered I'm extremely satisfied!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578795820718, "text": "Thanks for the opportunity Ed!!

I am sorry to read that your expectations for your phone and the end results were not a closer match. After speaking to the technician and reviewing our records, they suggest that the device came in with the complaint and visual indications that the device had experienced an extreme fall. This incident resulted in the severe damage to both the front lcd/digitizer, middle frame, as well as the back battery door or rear housing. Unfortunately devices that have that severe of damage, even after minor repair such as a screen change, can still have additional problems that are not detectable until after interaction with the device can be achieved. Your above review is not entirely accurate as you stated \"now it wont work and they cant fix it\". The device does work and you are able to interact with the device through the new lcd/digitizer and the battery door has been replaced, as you requested. If you were to take your car in to have a new front and rear windshield replaced, then afterward, state that the transmission doesn't work as a result of replacing the windshields, well, that is not a logical conclusion. In your case of \"now it wont work and they cant fix it\", means that the device does work but will not make a phone call. Screen changes and battery door replacements only require a very minimum amount of heat being applied to the device in order to loosen the adhesives. This is very unlikely to cause any damage to the hardware that would relate to the devices' ability to connect to a carrier's network. However, in our efforts to ensure that every customer is satisfied that their device was repaired properly or that every practical effort was attempted to repair that device, I will be happy to meet you and attempt to diagnose the problem that may be causing your additional issue. While I can't say the device will be able to be repaired, I will give it my best efforts. Again I am sorry that your expectations were not met under the circumstances, but look forward to the opportunity to further assist you."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ff853f5f4f:0x45b1b3ecbda7cd17"}

They said they ordered a screen to repair my broken one, but on the day the screen was to arrive, they had absolutely no record of the location of the screen or even if it had been ordered. They then said it would take one more day, and when I asked the next day, they said three more days. It's been a week of \"just a few more days\" and still no screen. Steven M, their technician, cannot tell the location of the screen, or even if it has been ordered (even though he supposedly placed the order). Steven doesn't seem terribly concerned about checking the status until I show up in front of him. There is no response to my texts and certainly no pro-active checking on his part. Today I decided that if they cannot even tell whether a part has been ordered or where it is, then they certainly cannot be trusted to actually perform a repair.

I take it out to show the guy and he presses all over it, and while he is telling me my battery is swollen and causing the screen to bend, he turns it on and my screen was split in half! I couldn't use half my screen! I work 2 blocks away and have been very careful with my phone (have had a bent-ish screen for months!) so I really don't think this happened in my pocket. I called him out on it as soon as I saw the screen and he said \"Look, you can't even use the screen now\". He proceeded to talk about other things with my phone and didn't address the problem of him breaking my screen. He priced a screen and battery for me, but I declined and walked out because he broke my screen and absolutely refused to acknowledge it. I went back to the office, called this place and asked to speak to the manager. He asked what was wrong and I told him about the staff breaking my screen. He reveals that the guy I'm speaking with on the phone is the one who \"helped\" me in the store, and said that he is the manager and owned the store. I calmly explained to him what he did and how I watched him do it right in front of my face. He REFUSED to take responsibility and tried offering a $10 discount for both screen and battery instead. I said no thanks, and to have a nice day before hanging up. I am SO upset - I ended up just buying a new phone since it was about the same cost of what he would charge for a screen and battery.

Picked up my phone after the repair and am able to charge it fine but now no sound out of the speaker and no service.  Returned to batteries plus to have it looked at and was told by the technician that they replaced the charging port again because the one they previously installed had a small tear in the ribbon cable.  I was informed that this ribbon cable tear is why the speaker and antenna were not working.  When I leave the store for the 2nd time the speaker is now working and I have several bars of service so I assume problem solved.  Over the next day I drop virtually every phone call and service is sporadic going from no service to 4 bars back to 1 bar ever few minutes.  I return to batteries plus and they take my phone back and look at it for 30 min or so and tell me there is nothing they can do to fix it.  I tell them that this problem occurred due to the repair work they performed.  The technician tells me that they could not verify the phone was working 100% prior to them working on it so there is nothing they can do to help.  They suggested I do a software update...I do it and after the update my antenna is still messed up.  I understand they couldn\u2019t test it because it was dead and it wouldn\u2019t take a charge.  I also understand there are unhonest people out there that would take advantage of a repair shop but that is not the case here.  I had a fully functional phone that has never given me any problems just a bad charging port.  My recommendation would be to steer clear of repairing your phone and just trash it for a new one if anything goes wrong with it.  In my case the guys at batteries plus didn\u2019t stand behind their work and cost me $100 and lost me as a customer.

Once we got home, and the living room lights reflected off the edge, there were spyder cracks all up and down the right side.  The reason I know this is because, they have a habit of resting the TVs on the edge on concrete.  (You can see evidence of this by walking in the front door)  Unfortunately, some nicer LCDs have trim edges that are easily broken, scuffed, scratched. NO matter how careful you are if you are setting LCD monitors on concrete you will get damage.  Details like this annoy me.

I couldn't use half my screen! I work 2 blocks away and have been very careful with my phone (have had a bent-ish screen for months!) so I really don't think this happened in my pocket. I called him out on it as soon as I saw the screen and he said \"Look, you can't even use the screen now\". He proceeded to talk about other things with my phone and didn't address the problem of him breaking my screen. He priced a screen and battery for me, but I declined and walked out because he broke my screen and absolutely refused to acknowledge it. I went back to the office, called this place and asked to speak to the manager. He asked what was wrong and I told him about the staff breaking my screen. He reveals that the guy I'm speaking with on the phone is the one who \"helped\" me in the store, and said that he is the manager and owned the store. I calmly explained to him what he did and how I watched him do it right in front of my face. He REFUSED to take responsibility and tried offering a $10 discount for both screen and battery instead. I said no thanks, and to have a nice day before hanging up. I am SO upset - I ended up just buying a new phone since it was about the same cost of what he would charge for a screen and battery.

I broke the LCD screen of my Samsung Galaxy 6 and brought it in to be repaired. They asked for my phone number (I clarified that they wanted the number of the phone I was leaving with them), and told me to come back in a few hours. A few hours later, I come back and they haven't done anything yet. They said they'd have to replace the frame of my phone (because it would break when they removed it) as well but they didn't have a matching gold one in stock and needed my permission to use a white frame instead. The guy said \"we called you but couldn't get in touch\"...well yeah, you called the phone in your hand. So whatever, I come back a few hours later and it's still not done and I have to wait another half hour. I finally get it back and the frame is extended a few millimeters from the front of my phone- hard to describe but made it more difficult to press the home button and felt very fragile. A few months later, the frame is starting to peel off and I hear a crackling noise every time I press the screen. I took it to a different phone repair place back home, where I was told the first repair was incredibly sloppy. The guy there told me the first repair hadn't even glued the frame back on and it was a miracle it hadn't fallen off yet. For less than $50 (and in under an hour), he glued it on correctly and my phone looks new (aside from the mismatched front). I'm giving 2 stars because I understand things like the mismatched frame isn't their fault, and I knew it was going to be pricey, but overall it was not a good experience at all.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573606687003, "text": "Please contact us and let us know how we can improve.

I say just give me my phone and a refund I'll take it elsewhere. I had already spent money on another phone that I brought home and doesn't work but I wasn't going to say anything about it.so then he says we can't do that ! I asked why and his answer was store policy ! It's my phone I own it ,it's my money ,I have had no service plus at the time it was 13 days far from the original 2 or 3 I was told .then he couldn't find my phone so I waited approximately 30 mins and the white guy comes out and says and you could see he was stalling.and said so what are you going to do?I said I'm waiting on my phone and my money.the Arab guy comes back hollering at the back find that phone .said I wasn't listening and I wasn't getting anything and proceeds to pull a sticker off my phone.I said I want my phone my money and leave that sticker on it .he said he didn't have to.took the sticker off and my phone to the back.at this point I was outraged,grabbed his moniter layer it over a said give me my damn phone and he called the police,police said it was a litagation issue when I talked to them and the thievery was not a 911 police matter .also if you look at the mama's of the 5 stars on this page you will find common ground in 85% of the names ! Today is day 19 one extra day from the last time I spoke with the liars at the phone clinic, I'll be returning to check in on things today with a real phone tech.and offer them one last chance to let them make it right,today ! The business is out of my way and would have never even went there had I not called ahead of time and was told the normal wait was a hour  !

I left it there and went back home and had planned to pick it up in a little while. After 4 hours had passed, I called to make sure it was ready. When one of the techs answered he told me that Hunter- the tech that worked on my phone- would call me back in just a minute be he did not know anything about it. I never got a call back from Hunter. So I called again and they told me they couldn't put my phone back together bc the tool that they had to use to do it had striped and they couldn't do anything until Monday. I called apple to see if they could take a look and they told me to bring it in, so I did, only two find out he striped the entire cable that made my phone work. I would have to pay over $300 for a new phone. When I had only paid $100 for it in the first place.

PROBLEM THAT I DIDN\u2019T HAVE WITH THE CHEAPER SCREEN FIRST.\nAnyways I gave a call and he said he would order a new one and he would call me when it arrived.\nAfter about a week I never got a call so I went in, to find out he probably didn\u2019t order the screen because he didn\u2019t have it.\nANYWAYS THAT WAS MY 4th TIME HAVING TO DRIVE THERE.\nA couple days later I called and he finally had the screen, so I went again and he replaced it & said that should fix the problem. I left and after using my phone noticed the problem was worst. So the next day I drive there for the 6th time & told him this was not working for me, so I\u2019m guessing he got in his feelings, & said (and I quote) \u201cWe can do two things, either you can just ROCK WITH IT, or I can take off that screen and put a cracked screen & give you a refund\u201d\nSo I said well give me a refund so I can take it to apple, so I\u2019m waiting for 15 min and I go back to pick up the phone, a cracked screen of course.\nSo then he has the audacity to ask for a receipt I said well I don\u2019t have it, I shouldn\u2019t need one I\u2019ve drove to this place 6 times in the last 3 weeks & he still asks for a receipt.\nWhich of course were 2 receipts one for the $100 and the 2nd one for $50.\nSo he said there is nothing I can do.\nSo at this point I\u2019m mad because I have a cracked screen and no refund. So I said well put the other screen I guess I\u2019ll take it like that.\n\nSo overall guys, GO TO APPLE OR SOMEWHERE where they know what they are doing.\nBecause obviously this place doesn\u2019t.\nI should\u2019ve read the bad reviews before I went here.\nBecause now I have to pay more money to fix the screen again for something I could\u2019ve payed once at a professional place.\nI\u2019m not the person to write bad reviews but after driving 6 times to this place and wasting time and then basically still having a messed up well I had no choice to write this so other people don\u2019t go through this problem.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb71ff61b27:0x22e9a380c51ac4c3"}

I took my sons phone there to see if it could be fixed. Carter said that he could fix the phone but he would have to order basically a whole new inner part to phone. I asked what if it does not work after that? Carter said he would return money and get parts he could use them.So after 2 weeks he finally says after I call once again it is done. I go to get phone battery is low he tells me it is because hasn\u2019t been charged, after told me he had been charging all day to see if worked. So I tell him I thought you charged all day? Carter said no been charging and letting phone die all day to make sure turns back on! So get home charge phone and it charged all night to take to get SIM card next day, phone goes dead within two hours. Carter said ordered new battery\ud83d\ude44 so get phone to Company to place sim and it won\u2019t recognize SIM card. Obviously the phone is not fixed. So I call Carter who tells me no problem. I will refund money towards a new phone and can order . I said how much would that cost? I had already paid 160. He said I would get brand new phone for 180 more. I told him I would probably just get a phone or order through insurance because the phone can\u2019t be fixed. Carter proceeds to tell me he has worked for those companies and they are crooks. They don\u2019t give you new phones but phones that have same problem yours had. He gets phones from company that are new and that\u2019s why cost more than insurance. . At that point said ok and waited weeks without phone because said they were out of stock. I finally told him I was coming to get refund because I was going to buy phone and not to worry about it. So I take the phone, Carter tells me it will be a couple hours. I said ok then Carter calls me and said I can\u2019t refund your money because this phone has had a new screen placed on it. I said it didn\u2019t need a screen when brought it. The screen was not cracked. He said yeah we had to replace screen. I said if you replaced screen then that\u2019s the screen you replaced. I have not took the phone anywhere else and why would I when waiting on phone to supposedly be ordered! Carter then said I can show you I make a mark on all my screens. I said I don\u2019t know what kind of mark you make but apparently you forgot to do it because no one has touched that phone. Nobody worked on that phone besides these crooks! They did not fix the phone! Carter blatantly lied to me and never intended to refund my money. He made sure he was gone when my husband went to get phone. They had no idea who husband was but handed him the phone. This is the worst so called business I have ever worked with. Carter who called other people crooks was the crook!

My hope was that a repair shop would have more experience and would have more finesse than I. The price they charged was right in line with other repair shops in the area, and it was convenient being able to shop around in the mall while they did repairs. I was disappointed to get my phone back and find that the phone had dents and chips all over the place from where they pulled it apart, and they even broke the camera glass and bent the back panel. It seems like they didn't watch the youtube videos available for my phone repair because he said the glass broke because they forgot there were screws placed behind it. I don't know if I could have done a job equal to what they did and saved ~$50, but I guess we'll never know. the guys at the shop had no problem purchasing and replacing the ganked up parts at no cost, but I had to wait weeks for the replacement parts to arrive. My experience is most likely different from what other people will have since my phone is not common and parts are not readily in stock and it is difficult to repair. I would also say that if your phone is easier than mine you might be able to buy the replacement parts yourself and browse youtube and save yourself some money. You could probably do just as well a job and leave just as many marks in your phone if you did it yourself. Also, they don't tend to call you when your parts arrive. The date they give you of when your parts will arrive is 100% accurate, but they will not call you.

Everything is on his demands, but never his fault.  Respect is free, try giving it away sometime.\n\nDon't believe his stories.  He complained in LESS than a week - regarding a shipment originating in Canada - which were the terms he agreed to when he purchased (and also mirrored by the eBay shipping expected time).  But mistakes happen - all I needed was for him to say 'Sorry, my mistake'...  But he couldn't do that - preferring to say that he would be leaving negative feedback (for something he was completely wrong about).  Fortunately I had not shipped the part yet, as I was going to be in the US shortly, and able to do a much quicker & more secure USPS shipment...  But once you threaten negative feedback over something that you're wrong about, and are repeatedly unable to understand that you're in the wrong - damn right I'm canceling that order.  I have the right to \"fire\" a customer who is not conducting themselves appropriately.\n\nMost notable is the fact that negative feedback was left for me, and it took ~5 minutes for the eBay rep to review the details and get it taken down.  His complaints to eBay have resulted in absolutely zero effect on my account.  Clearly he was in the wrong in every part of this transaction, and he has YET to take responsibility or apologize for his errors.

Ordered a battery from Amazon and they couldn't get the back of the phone off.  So they call the Verizon retail store in hazel green and the girl told her to take it to ch pc repair and he would do it.  My mothers phone worked FINE when she took it in there.  She could do anything and everything on her phone.  When she went to pick it up the phone would not even turn on.   He said he tried both old and new battery and it still wouldn't come on.  So he took the screen off and put it on another phone and the screen works.  So he is saying that the mother board is messed up.  He can check it out BUT he'd have to charge her to do it.  Momma said he really messed the back up,  like it was melted!!  I met her up there and his attitude is  basically \"screw you \".  He insisted that the phone was not working when she took it in.  I asked him why he didn't call her and tell her and he said because she didnt leave a number.  To which my reply is \"when you work in customer service like this it is your responsibility to get a number so you can get in touch with the person\". He is a total jerk!!  He takes ZERO responsibility for his screw ups.  Said he was not going to make it right.  But he did tell her that he'd buy the phone from her when she bought a new one.  Then he threatened to call the cops on us \"because it was after hours, he was closed and we wouldn't leave\".  He never asked us to leave, period.  He brags about how much money he makes per year and all of his vehicles and house is paid for.  Good for him.  I dont give a \ud83d\udc01but what he has and doesn't have.  And now Marina tells us that her stepfather took a phone to him that was kinda messed up and was going to get the guy to repair it.

You came into my office, clearly disgruntled. You then continued to talk over me without giving me a chance to respond or explain the situation.\n\nPam visited my store with her device, which she believed to have a battery issue. She provided an aftermarket battery and had explained that an attempt was made, using a hairdryer, to open the casing and replace the battery, prior to me looking at the device. When the device was dropped off, I was in the middle of an extensive repair, as well as having a conversation with a different client. Not only that, but the device was dropped off quickly, without any contact information, and with very few details.\n\nI replaced the battery with the after-market battery she provided and then attempted to boot up the device, but to no avail. I investigated further but was unable to find a solution. Pam then arrived to pick up her device, and she was, understandably, very upset to find it not working. She wanted it in working order right then and there, and while I understand her sentiments, I can only do so much so quickly. I needed more time to troubleshoot and determine the problem and possible solution, but she would not allow it. I was even willing to reimburse her with a fair value for her device.\n\nI have been in business for more than 10 years now. I work hard every day, and I like to think that I am very good at what I do. I manage hundreds of computers monthly, and I repair and fix many devices daily (thousands of devices yearly). I can remove a device's back/screen in a few minutes with simply a bit of heat and some playing cards, and I have never had any issues. I would never damage a device intentionally. I treat all repairs as if they were my own. That being said, mistakes can (and do) happen as there are many risks involved with these repairs, but I do my best to make things right. To me, it's not just about collecting payment for the services I provide\u2014although that is necessary for me to stay in business and provide for my family. It's about building long-term relationships with my clients, and I deeply enjoy helping and providing knowledge to my clients.\n\nThis is the first complaint I have received with the BBB, and I would truly like to resolve the issue, and have the opportunity to change your outlook on me and your experience with my business. CH PC Repair is my business\u2014it has my name in it, a fact that I am proud of and would never change.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Harbin\nCH PC Repair"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623f52db6fed93:0x398f7a17a9216be3"}

Much time was spent on this phone in trying to find the model number. It's just very unusual for such a device not to have one listed anywhere on the phone. We waived the $40 fee that we could have charged the customer for our efforts. The week delay the customer complained about was due to his electing free shipping instead of having the part expedited. We informed the customer at the start that it would take anywhere from a week or more for a part to arrive if he chose the free shipping option and did not want to pay for it to be expedited.

The tech accidentally broke the screen on it and told me it was because the people who replaced my phone screen(He was implying Phone Probs) didn\u2019t instal it right. I was mad, as anyone would be, and I was very expressive in telling phone Probs they owed me a new screen for installing a faulty one. Now, I am a very very VERY  verbal person, and even after I fed them my 2 cents, 25 cents, and a few swear words in between, Drew and his wonderful father still stood by my side and tried to assist me. While they didn\u2019t replace it for free, they showed me how it couldn\u2019t have just broke and the Apple guy probably broke it and didn\u2019t own up to it, they helped me replace the screen and I am forever satisfied with this business again.\nThey are good people with hearts of gold.

I hired him to repair the circuit board in my welder. Paid him for the job, which only half of it was done. Asked him to replace all of the capacitors on the board. He did not. He left a diode that he had cut loose. The soldering was the worst looking hack jobs I have ever seen. He picked up the board and was paid $90 initially to check it on the machine. I had to drive to Dothan to retrieve it from him and paid the balance of $145. Installed the board and the welder has no output at all now. Originally agreed upon price was $220. When I got the board back the diode was never reconnected, the solder joints were ridiculously poor. And the welder still does not work. He came out and wanted another $25 to \u201ccheck\u201d the board again. He came and \u201cchecked\u201d the board again. He said there is another bad part on the board. How could there be another bad part if he checked the whole board. So after seeing the poor workmanship displayed. I asked for a partial refund. He said no. So now I am out $235 and my welder still doesn\u2019t work. If I had only known that he couldn\u2019t do the job to start with, I would never have hired him to do it.
