On Pinterest to frame your bathroom mirror it involved me owning and operating a miter saw, taping pieces up after applying liquid nail glue and it was all just to much! Mirror Renovations allowed me to enter my measurements online, pick out my frame I wanted and they shipped it to me for free. All I needed to assemble my frame was a Phillips head screw driver and I had a brand new mirror up in less than 10 minutes. It covers my mirror clips and the frame is flush to the mirror, no one can tell it wasn't hung as one piece. I tell everyone about you guys and I am so grateful to you!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536241479928, "text": "Thank you! We are so excited to hear about successful D.I.Y. renovations with our mirror frames.
