An hour after working Mr. Odell came over asked me to follow him so I did, well he walked me up to the front where the Temp Agency Lady awaits to let me know that she ended my assignment with noewarnno of knowing that I'm not supposed to report a problem to the Head person over the company and also saying something about not meeting production which is a Very Big Story as she knew that because I've known her for awhile and for over 23years I've been working for temporary agencies I've not Ever had a Complaint, Write Up nor laid off for that reason. Mr.Odell made a Wonderful Compliment to me on my second full week of working there,i started on the Packing line about one week then I voluntarily moved to Assembly 770 line. I stayed on that line feeling better about the few ones that was working on the line being mature as a work place should be. Well after working on 770 Assembly line for two months or more, Matthew George a young man who has a awful past and was the only one signed up for the position was over that area I worked. He says alot about what he's going to do and doesn't always mark his words, well he heard that I was going to the Head person about him and also another young lady on 770 Assembly line had major issue with him so he came up to me helping with the machine that messes up alot saying out of the blue medleying about me going to the Head person but said nothing to the other young lady. ???? Make this shorter Matthew had me go back to Packing line for like four days training me to do Scopes different ones so I did okay no major mess up as a normal person training well he walked up to a few ones plotted on me the camera will show you that turned them against me and went behind my back and spoke against me in a meeting the same day the Temp Agency Lady ended my assignment,why wasn't I wasn't able to defend myself with the few people on the line I worked the longest on to speak about me. Then Mark Odell spoked against me because he's scared of Matthew George when he Complimented me about my good work. Mannnnn, DO NOT work for Matthew George unless you're going to kiss up to him. He has no Good Remembering Knowledge! He told me after moving me back on the Packing line the same day within 45minutes that \"He knew that I wadnwa going to like it over there', meaning he knew what he was doing to set me up. Second Shift work for Carlos he is a Very Positive Man! Matthew George second Shift, more power to you. I'm at a Better Workplace now Thank God!
