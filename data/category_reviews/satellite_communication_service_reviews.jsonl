We took my car to them and they had it 4 days.  Finally after a lot of phone calls they said it was done.  It tried to sync my phone and it did but no sound out of the speakers.  They couldn't figure out the problem so the installer promised he'd call the manufacturer Monday morning and call me.  No phone call.  I called him and got his voice mail.  No return call.  I called the shop and was told they would call as soon as he got in .  No call.  I also called Sirus to have that transferred from my other radio but they didn't hook it up.  So here I sit with a very expensive radio and CD player.  At this point the ball is in their court and I'm waiting to see what they do.
