Found this place and decided to give it a try. They had to order my screen and we paid in advance. Asked about insurance, which we don't have on my phone because I've never broken any of my phones. The guy at the counter kept commenting on how expensive it was going to be.... okay, so?... I want my phone fixed and your business does this right...?\n\nWe paid and were told it would take 3 to 5 days for the screen to come in; they would call me and I could come in and have the phone's screen replaced in an hour or so. 10 days pass and no one calls me. My husband calls them and they say the screen is in and I can come in and get it replaced. They then try to call me, but I was unavailable. The next day, he drops the phone off as soon as they open at 10am, and was informed that the only one who could fix it wasn't there yet. He would be there in 45mins and it would take 2hrs to fix the screen. 2 hrs....\n\nMy husband decided to go to the gym, then come home and clean up. He called them at 2pm and my phone was still being worked on: they said give him more time. He arrived there after 3:30pm and the phone was not finished being repaired. Decided to pick up dinner next door. Still not done. So finally, around 4pm it is finished. It works and has a lifetime warranty for the pressure sensitivity. This was one thing I was concerned about: the screen's pressure sensitivity.\n\nI get my phone and inspect it. It was not even sealed properly! Therefore, it is not waterproof anymore, and not resellable. Annoyed, I go to the shop myself and the tech who worked on my phone is very apologetic, admits it was done incorrectly, but is unable to help me. He said he was busy and trying to hurry because my husband had been waiting for a while. Still has a lot of things to work on; I could leave it overnight, come by tomorrow. Maybe it would get done. I can't leave my phone there overnight, and I can't come back the next day. He was going to try and put weight on the phone before taking the screen off and resealing it.\n\nThat is what I'm trying to do now: put weight on it. I wrapped it in screen cleaning cloths and set a gallon water jug on it. About 7 or 8 lbs. I asked him how much weight, but he never answered me, telling me instead about the warranty. The warranty is for the screen's pressure sensitivity.\n\nI'd rather have it take a long time and done correctly, than rushed and crappy. Now, I'm trying to correctly their mistake. I don't think pressing it down with weight will help. It is misaligned somewhere, and not glued and seal properly.\n\nPaid $340 to have my phone's screen replaced and they didn't do it properly. The back part is spongy; you press down and it comes back up. The whole left side was not placed correctly or glued down properly. Would never go here again. And would urge everyone to not waste their time until the people at CPR have better organization and attention to detail. They also seem like they need more knowledgeable people. My husband was told this tech had never worked on a Samsung Note 8 and that one of them only works on computers and laptops; no phones at all.

I was advised instead to purchase a wireless charger elsewhere and a battery from them since mine was weak. I did buy the battery from them and they came from the back with a battery that had no seal or package and sold it to me for $40 and took my old battery, which it would not charge past 20% until I bought a new battery from another location indicating they sold me a used battery as new. What they didn't inform me was that my phone was not wireless charging capable. I went back to try and get a refund but I was never given a receipt and they said they can't do anything about it since they have no records of them selling it to me. Not only am I now stuck with a used battery that was sold as a new but was given false information. I took my business to another phone repair shop that was capable of performing my repair at $65 compared to their quoted $200 and my screen never had to be shattered.

We would have been happy to explain why this is the way that it is.\n\nThe repair shop that you brought your device to has the capability of micro soldering a new charging port to the existing cable. We do not have that capability which means that we must remove the entire flex cable to change the port. The problem with that is the navigation buttons that are on the phone are sealed under the screen and wrap around to the charge port. Meaning for us to get those out we must lift the screen after heating it substantially. It\u2019s very risky and leads to cracked LCDs in most cases.\n\nWe NEVER want to take advantage of anyone. We set expectations for everything. We would rather you know the entire truth before going with our service.\n\nNow, to the battery. We buy batteries in bulk which do not come in \u201cretail\u201d packaging. We would have gladly given you a full refund on that item if it was not working up to our standards.\n\nAs you can see from most of our reviews, we go above and beyond for our customers. A $40 battery would not be worth losing a customer over.\n\nI will still gladly refund the $40 if you come in and ask for Jessie.\n\nAs I appreciate the feedback I believe a 1 star review isn\u2019t warranted in this case. We just lack the capabilities in making that specific repair cheaper.\n\nThe reality is the explanation you were given is 100% accurate because we would need to replace the screen as well which cost well over $100 just to get it to our shop.\n\nI am happy that you were able to get it fixed elsewhere and for cheaper. We cannot speak to other repair shops capabilities, only our own.\n\nThanks for your consideration and please come see us for your refund.\n\nJessie"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7349200629:0xa1f9cde73259baf4"}

Unfortunately, a lot of equipment brought in for repair is not worth the cost of repair. We decline to repair a lot of equipment. In these situations we offer alternative solutions such as migrating to a new computer, or providing a backup so you can purchase equipment elsewhere.\n4- There is another business in the area with a very similar name that has caused confusion in the past.

I was blown away at the price so I decided to think on it. Shawn told me the part alone cost 50 dollars. I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue. Additionally I found the part on eBay new for less than 20 dolllars. Not to mention the fact that the diagnoses when they originally took it apart would have been an extra screw to replace the DC jack which he tried charging me another 100 bucks. All together a very bad experience and I would rather avoid this place at all cost.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507037043493, "text": "sir we dont use ebay parts\nsorry for the drive being left out\neverybody makes mistakes\nand the diagnoses you was informed about up front\nu did not have to leave it'\nsorry for ur inconvenience"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892928318bc5bf3:0x74cb69ce96d94207"}

For example,   there are shipping delays from overseas of products that are needed here for the assembly of furniture and chips for new cars.  Because of those delays dates change every day. When we do let our customers know a date, it can change the same afternoon which frustrates the customer even more.\n\nBefore the Pandemic, we could deliver on 90% of our goods within a 2-4 week time period. Now we cannot promise any date...the only thing we ask is that you hold on to your old furniture until your new furniture  arrives. We have even loaned out new furniture while a customer waits.\nWe have wholesale prices right now to help with that unfortunate waiting period. Some items come in next week after delivery, but some do not. It varies with every piece.\n\nWe value our customers, and if we could change what is going on in America we would . We go above and beyond for all of our customers. I just ask that you try and understand the circumstances that all retail establishments are having to deal with and navigate through. They are difficult, and we are all trying our best to get your items here as quickly as we can.\nFactories in America are also understaffed, and those who are working are doing their very best as well. Transportation is trying to find more drivers, so that items can also be delivered in a timely fashion.\nWe have kept our prices  lower than anyone  to help better ease that frustration of timely delivery dates. So it is a great time to purchase from us, but patience will be needed in case dates change on an item.\nThank you so much for your understanding, and if you did purchase from us under a different name - I am sorry for the delays, and I too wished we had control over dates fluctuating."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e9ae266e8c0cf:0x9e6dbbd1150862fd"}

I was told that I would have my iPhone back within 3 days and I have been dealing with CPR for about 3 to 4 week. Within these 3 to 4 weeks I have been more than 5 times and nothing was ever complete. when I got my phone back. My center button was perminately pressed in. So I called back (this should have never happened anyways) and told the guy what was up and we discussed me coming back on Monday (my ONLY off day) and the shop NEVER OPENED. nor was there even a number to leave a message. As a customer I feel this was disrespectful. Because not once was I called this time or the Times before to be told \"I'm sorry your device is not ready or, your part didn't come in\" anything to prevent me from driving all the way from where I live which is not in the city of Montgomery. The amount of gas that has gone though my car just traveling back and forth to this place is unspeakable.. Because the site  never opened Monday, I took the phone to another repair place only to be told \"the hole for this phone is too small. This isn't the right screen.\" ... So, I paid over 100 dollars to be given back a phone that isn't properly fixed. how can you give a customer back a phone that isn't properly fixed and that's the whole point of the store. I feel like that is SO shady because I did my part. There is no way this couldn't have been seen.

I have never in my life dealt with such an unprofessional group of people. Before I brought my phone to these people, every single thing on it worked perfectly. The only issue I had is that there was a scratch on the left side of the screen that irritated me. So I tried to do the right thing and support a local business (or at least a business in the area). On August 5, 2015, I prepaid $161.49 for a screen and service for an iPhone 6. I was told that I would be notified when the parts arrived.\n\nDays go by, and I don't hear from them. I had to call on the 11th and finally ask what exactly was going on. They had an excuse about how their delivery of parts was delayed. Either way, they'd have it the next day. So I'm pretty understanding, and I agree that'd be fine. I take the phone in on August 12. Again, they do not call me - I had to turn up and see whether it was done. I wait approximately 10 minutes after arriving since they were apparently still working on it. Everything looked good initially when I got it back, but I started noticing problems almost right away on the phone.\n\nThere was an absolutely immense battery drain on the phone, but more importantly than even that was the ambient light sensor not working, the backlighting at the top of the phone was WAY off, (and they should have noticed that if nothing else if they repair phones for a living) and the proximity sensor wasn't working. If you don't know what a proximity sensor is, when you hold a smartphone up to your head to talk, it shuts the screen off so it doesn't register contact with the screen. It makes it very difficult to use your phone as a phone when it isn't working. The next day, on August 13, I call them back and explain the issue. They agree to take a look at it again and see if there's something they missed. I understand that sometimes, these things happen.\n\nCan't make it there before close on August 14, but I do arrive on August 15th. Another employee looks at the phone, and says that there's just an issue with the screen at this point. They'll have to order another screen to resolve these issues. It's frustrating, but I understand, and I agree, and ask them to contact me when it is in. I waited 10 days, and heard nothing from them. Called a little late in the day on August 25th, and I was told that they got the part in either the day before or that day. So, I mean, thanks for the heads up, right? Can't make it there that day, so I take it in on August 26th.\n\nOn August 26th, I drop the phone off yet again around 12:00. The employee says they're a little backed up, but they should hopefully have it ready in about 2 1/2 hours. I told him it was fine. Close to that time later, I got a call saying the screen was on the phone, and they were going to test the other functions. Got another call later, and they told me that the screen was working fine, but that they could not get the proximity sensor to work. They claimed to have tested different parts, but they simply could not get the proximity sensor to work on the phone. I asked how we intended to resolve this issue, especially since it worked when I brought it to them.\n\nI was told that they could either place a damaged screen on the phone (not my original screen in this case, but one that was much, much more damaged) and get a refund, or that basically, I'd have to live with it. This is literally three weeks to this point, and I absolutely need that telephone. Time I don't have it almost always translates to lost productivity. So essentially, my choice was to get my phone back in worse shape than I brought it in, and get my money back, or to keep the screen and they don't fix an issue they caused. I essentially had no real choice in the matter. I am contacting my credit card company to get my money back. They are a terrible business, and your money would be better spent anywhere else.

I was told by all four people that the deposit was necessary because people bring their computers there and never come to pick them up. I pointed out that was not the case here. I then asked if I could come there and purchase the power supply for $80 minus the $35 that had already been paid. At first the answer was yes you can do that but we won\u2019t guarantee the part. I said I was fine with that. As the conversation progressed and I pressed for a solid answer on the purchase person number four (apparently the top of the ladder there) he began to to fish tail. He said power supplies can range in price. I reminded him the technician actually showed the power supply to my son that was needed for his computer. The price tag said $80. He said you can bring the computer back and we will look at it before the EOB today. At this point I wouldn\u2019t trust these people to hold a penny. Person number four hung up me. It\u2019s a scam.

After leaving my PC at his house, some 30+ minutes later I received a phone call from him telling me that the BIOs password was not working and was incorrect of which I attested that it was correct. I turn around and go back to his house to try my password and upon the screen was an enter password prompt which was not my BIOs password prompt.\n\nHe was running a bootable USB connected to my device (of which I was presently unaware) as a ploy that my BIOs was locked and essentially bricked. Upon him making a few statements that my PC was useless now (any proper computer geek would know otherwise) I decided to take my leave *WITH* my computer. I'm not sure if he was expecting me to just leave it, offer to sell it to him or charge me surplus to fix the imaginary problem.\n\nOn my way home I pondered over this quite a bit and was very worried that he installed something that would prevent me accessing it. I'm also worried that whatever program he was running from the USB recorded my attempted passwords. When I arrive home I immediately plug in my PC in a network isolated environment and the computer boots as normal into the actual BIOs with my BIOs password working as expected. I am very thankful that he did not change the actual BIOs password and truly brick my motherboard.\n\nWhatever rogue program he showed me and tried to convince me that this was my BIOs password prompt is non-existent on my computer. Also to note, I don't think I will be able to respond to whatever he says towards this review because of how the reviews here work.

He looked at it and took some of it apart and told me a memory card was messed up and he thought the motherboard was bad.  He proceeded to give me an estimate of up to $300 and told me he would ship it off to a company in San Diego he works with and they could fix it and it should be ready in two weeks.  He also told me my computer was under warranty which i was aware of but clearly spilling water on your computer is a breach of warranty so he told me if money was an issue to lie to dell and try to get them to fix it for free, i told him i did not want to do that so i gave it to him to fix. He made me put down a $100 deposit which he said consisted of $30 of shipping each way, which immediately confused me because my laptop weighs maybe 2 pounds, and $40 of labor on his part.  Reluctantly i did.\n\n2 weeks later\nI get a call from dell telling me to go pick up my laptop from the technician and ship it to them to fix it  for free.  So i go to Dan and he tells me he never sent my laptop off (so he has been sitting on it for 2 weeks and didn't tell me anything about a change of plans) and he looked at the back and saw it was under warranty (Duh, i know. but i breached the warranty).  He then proceeded to tell me he tried to call dell and get them to fix it and talked to them about it and they told him it was a bad motherboard.  They wouldn't let him ship it to them because he doesn't own the laptop.  I tell him to just give me the laptop and ill ship it to them (because i don't want it back in the slow ass amount of time he does things in). He gives me the laptop and i ask about the $100 deposit.  He says he has already spent wayyy to much time on it and says i'm lucky he didn't charge me more.  !!!( He charged me $100 to look at my computer for 20 minutes and then talk to dell on the phone for 1 hour, which i did not pay him to do, nor did he ask me before he did)!!! so i get my laptop and leave hoping to never deal with this individual again.\n\n!!Read This!!\nI give my laptop to dell and get it fixed for less than he quoted me and they get it back to me in 10 days.  I still had to go through the entire troubleshooting process with dell which took 1 hour 15 minutes on the phone which Dan said he did for me. At no point did they mention a motherboard.  Actually at no point did they predict any problems.  The problem was a hard drive and the memory.\n\nAn educated guess\nI personally think Dan was trying to get my laptop fixed for free by Dell and then tell me he fixed it and charge me out the ass for fixing it, do i know this? no. Maybe he is just extremely incompetent at guessing problems.\n\nConclusion\nTerrible experience, treated me like an idiot, slow, rip off, DO NOT USE", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8886028fbc24ff05:0x8a67c7288a27f929"}

I got my laptop second hand at a great discount, because it was a model made with weak hinges, causing the previous owner to have the screen replaced after an accident.  After I dropped it a short distance on its hinge, the display ceased to work, even though the rest of the laptop's functionality was normal.  I figured that it was a pretty open-and-shut loose wire problem, and that it would help to tell Dan these things when I arrived.\n\nHowever, when I brought the laptop in, I accidentally grabbed the wrong, but near identical charger.  After he learned I brought the wrong charger, he treated me like a complete idiot, and disputed most anything I had to say.  The laptop's power button was flashing the 'low battery' pattern that I recognize, because Alienware laptops have highly customize-able lights.  Dan insisted that he couldn't do anything until I brought the proper charger in, because the laptop could have been flashing an error code, possibly indicating a software issue.  I was ready to fetch the proper charger, but wanted to leave the laptop with him while I did, explaining that I recognized the pattern and it was probably a hardware issue similar to the one it had before.  However, he pressed upon me that it was likely a software issue, 'proving' this by hooking it up to a monitor by VGA, and getting no response.  My laptop has never allowed the shortcut keys on my laptop to reroute the display until I got past the login screen, which we obviously couldn't do without a display, so this was a pretty irritating response.\n\nHe then repeated his point about the potential of an error code in the flashing power button light several times, using increasingly smaller words each time, and gave me a little diatribe on the importance of bringing a charger with you when you get a laptop repaired, a point that I had already raised, apologized for, and was so blindsightingly obvious as to be insulting.  After the fifth iteration of the 'error code' talk, we left.\n\nTLDR;\nThe problem was a loose connection, and took another business less than half an hour to fix.  In the same amount of time, Dan had unsuccessfully plugged in a VGA cable, explained to me the importance of chargers and batteries, misidentified the problem, and ignored anything I had to say about the origin of the problem and the way my laptop worked.

Even now, the tablet is not working properly, but I would rather deal with the tablet than these guys.\nI talked to the owner and told him exactly what happened and he only said he was sorry and their techs needed to work on their customer service!\nI will never take anything back to these guys!

Steven M, their technician, cannot tell the location of the screen, or even if it has been ordered (even though he supposedly placed the order). Steven doesn't seem terribly concerned about checking the status until I show up in front of him. There is no response to my texts and certainly no pro-active checking on his part. Today I decided that if they cannot even tell whether a part has been ordered or where it is, then they certainly cannot be trusted to actually perform a repair.

Mr Garcia had fallen for a scam artist and had allowed the person access to his computer. The laptop was terribly infected. I cleaned the system of the infections, tools, and changes made to his computer, which I cleaned and worked through midnight on Friday night to ensure he would have it back on Saturday.  To work on the computer I had to set the desktop magnifier back to normal 100% rather than 150% magnification. On opening Monday morning, 12/18, he came back into the shop very angry and abusive, complaining he couldn't see his desktop.  I set the desktop magnification back to 150%, and he told me about the password problem.  I tried to go through the 2 step verification with him to retrieve his password, but since he had previously done this multiple times at home , he had been put into \"time out\" by Google, telling him to come back and try again in a few hours.  He demanded that I call google and get it fixed, which google doesn't do (to my knowledge).  I asked him to be patient and try again later, but he continued to be abusive.  We did receive a message that the password was changed 6 days before, which would have been December 12.  He stated he thought he knew the password, but it didn't work.  I tried tell the customer that these safeguards were in place for the safety of his account and information, but he refused to believe that I couldn't just pick up the phone and call Google and get this problem fixed.

We had severe thunderstorms so she made an appointment to come out yesterday (5/5/21).\n1. The tire that was flat occurred because a stump likely nudged the tire slightly off the rim and caused it to deflate. Derrick aired up the tire and it's still inflated after ~24hours.\n2. Derrick and Monique also took my car to fix the fender that was pulled away from the tire and now it looks as good as new.\n3. As we were talking we mentioned our dog recently got into a fight with another dog that came on to our property and it's ears was bleeding and caused a lot of flies to irritate my dog. Monique offered a suggestion as a possible solution to prevent the flies from bothering my dog. We thought we had the product she mentioned on hand, but we didn't. When Monique and Derrick took my car to fix the fender, she brought back the product she had mentioned at no charge. We later put it on our dog and it seemed to help reduce the flies irritating our dog. THANKS!\n\nAnyways, I hope I spelt their name correctly :P\n\nDue to the urgency they wanted to correct the error that occurred as well as help our dog. I highly recommend them.\n\nOriginal Review:\n- i was moving from one house to another so i paid him on pickup and let him towed the vehicle to my other house. When i got home after  i finished getting things from the house I was moving from. I noticed the car he moved had damage near the front passenger tire.  The rear passenger tire was also popped. Neither of these were there before being towed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888fcc240b1be49:0xe293d204f686b123"}

To give my company 3 stars just because we are not sitting around waiting on your arrival is not fair. Has it ever dawned on you that we are not sitting around twiddling our thumbs, we are not at the bowling alley having fun, we are not at a social party ,  we are working even when we are not at the store location. It's called out on a service call.\n\nWe have a sign permanently posted to the front door that states if we are not at the store please call the number listed and a rep will arrive to assist you within 15 minutes.  We have been at this location for 10 years, during that 10-year tenure my records show that we have service your computer needs just two times once in 2013 and once in 2014. Here it is 2018 that you show up and leave a negative review because you arrive one or two times and there's no one at the store to assist you. During our 10-year tenure there have been computer stores that have come and gone however we have survived, and the reason why we survived is because we do good work and most people obey the sign that is posted on the door.\n\nIf they come and we're not present they follow the instructions they simply pick up their cell phone dial the number listed and Presto a representative arrives within 15 minutes just as stated. You have been most unfair in your review, has it ever dawned on you that we are the only full service retail computer store that's in operation in Wetumpka also within a 20 to 30 mile radius? Shouldn't that alone tell you that we are busy and there will be times when we're not at the store?  You do know that we have a telephone number that most people call, even to make appointments.\n\nDid you pick up the phone and call us to inquire about where we are what we're doing? All of the previous years that we've service you, you've never taken the time to say anything good let alone take the time to leave a positive review.  But here it is after 10 years of service you choose to leave a 3 star review not in regard to our work or the quality of work,  but you leave a 3 star review all because you arrived and no one was at the location, and you failed to pick up the phone call call.\n\nWe service residental and business customers alike, and we provide house calls and onsite service to both. When a business calls us and states there main business computer is down, we setup an onsite service call leave the store even at times when no one will be left to service the store. Why do we do this?  Its not personal its just business.  There is more money to be made in one business service call then there is for us to sit in the store waiting on residential customers to find the time to bring there computer in.   For you to reply to our absence as thow we are out on lake martin fishing rather than taking care of business is certianly not fair judgment. The good book says \"Judge not lest you be judged, for the same measure in which you judge others, you will be judged\".\n\nMaybe the next time a solicitor comes to your residential door in an attempt to sell you a product and you're not home, maybe that's solicitor should log on to Google and leave you a negative review. Not based on the fact that you didn't buy his product, but a negative review based solely on the fact that you were not even home.\n\nIn closing, I would like for you to exercise your right to choose another store to do business with.  Best Buy would be the closest and is only 45 miles away from your residence.  I just can't see the logic in us continuing to service someone who has Judged us so unfairly. If you would like to discuss this matter further, our phone number has been the same now for 10 years. I hope you have a better day."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2694964e20c1:0x7e27f6a2f3473c19"}

He was not giving up, he had the knowledge to see the phone had potential to restore from the computer by the way it was trying to reconnect .

Told them exactly what (SPSPECIFICALLY AN INTEL PROCESSOR, expandable RAM, motherboards, lcd screen,) I had and they told me to come on. I went to probably irritating lengths to confirm that they bought these highly specific parts. In retrospect, I thought the name,odd, but after a long day didnt put the \"mac\" portion together....or I'd have asked SPECIFICALLY if they bought non-mac items. So,  I drove out from Theodore during rush hour....and they declined everything because it wasnt MAC (wed discussed what I had, mind you) and because they couldn't test board soldered parts.... He said that in refereme to RAM memory chips, a desktop cpu, and my 500gb hard drives...they only take solid state now, he said. And so on, and so on...\n\nI dunno what the game they were playing was, but I think experimac owes me a half tank of gas and an appology. Take the gas from the guy's paycheck (if you're paying guys who think UPGRADABLE RAM is soldered to the board, anyway. And processors and graphics cards for that matter) for so politely convincing me to bring it all out there after being given models and brands.  Everything I could do to maintain some class before I left. Nothing worse than going out of your way to ensure its not a fruitless trip, only to get there and find some genius has given you bad info...and then instead of owning it....lying through his teeth ever so easily with a smile on his face. Aparently my cloths from a day under my cars hood, disguised my occupation as an aerospace engineer.... and I looked like someone who believed hard drives require soldering. In the parking lot now trying to figure gasoline vs. Dive distance.\n\nRESPONSE TO BUSINESS: No, I'm passing. At this point, I believe ive done what's necessary to prevent this happening to someone else. I've made them aware.

I couldn't use half my screen! I work 2 blocks away and have been very careful with my phone (have had a bent-ish screen for months!) so I really don't think this happened in my pocket. I called him out on it as soon as I saw the screen and he said \"Look, you can't even use the screen now\". He proceeded to talk about other things with my phone and didn't address the problem of him breaking my screen. He priced a screen and battery for me, but I declined and walked out because he broke my screen and absolutely refused to acknowledge it. I went back to the office, called this place and asked to speak to the manager. He asked what was wrong and I told him about the staff breaking my screen. He reveals that the guy I'm speaking with on the phone is the one who \"helped\" me in the store, and said that he is the manager and owned the store. I calmly explained to him what he did and how I watched him do it right in front of my face. He REFUSED to take responsibility and tried offering a $10 discount for both screen and battery instead. I said no thanks, and to have a nice day before hanging up. I am SO upset - I ended up just buying a new phone since it was about the same cost of what he would charge for a screen and battery.

I broke the LCD screen of my Samsung Galaxy 6 and brought it in to be repaired. They asked for my phone number (I clarified that they wanted the number of the phone I was leaving with them), and told me to come back in a few hours. A few hours later, I come back and they haven't done anything yet. They said they'd have to replace the frame of my phone (because it would break when they removed it) as well but they didn't have a matching gold one in stock and needed my permission to use a white frame instead. The guy said \"we called you but couldn't get in touch\"...well yeah, you called the phone in your hand. So whatever, I come back a few hours later and it's still not done and I have to wait another half hour. I finally get it back and the frame is extended a few millimeters from the front of my phone- hard to describe but made it more difficult to press the home button and felt very fragile. A few months later, the frame is starting to peel off and I hear a crackling noise every time I press the screen. I took it to a different phone repair place back home, where I was told the first repair was incredibly sloppy. The guy there told me the first repair hadn't even glued the frame back on and it was a miracle it hadn't fallen off yet. For less than $50 (and in under an hour), he glued it on correctly and my phone looks new (aside from the mismatched front). I'm giving 2 stars because I understand things like the mismatched frame isn't their fault, and I knew it was going to be pricey, but overall it was not a good experience at all.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573606687003, "text": "Please contact us and let us know how we can improve.

I say just give me my phone and a refund I'll take it elsewhere. I had already spent money on another phone that I brought home and doesn't work but I wasn't going to say anything about it.so then he says we can't do that ! I asked why and his answer was store policy ! It's my phone I own it ,it's my money ,I have had no service plus at the time it was 13 days far from the original 2 or 3 I was told .then he couldn't find my phone so I waited approximately 30 mins and the white guy comes out and says and you could see he was stalling.and said so what are you going to do?I said I'm waiting on my phone and my money.the Arab guy comes back hollering at the back find that phone .said I wasn't listening and I wasn't getting anything and proceeds to pull a sticker off my phone.I said I want my phone my money and leave that sticker on it .he said he didn't have to.took the sticker off and my phone to the back.at this point I was outraged,grabbed his moniter layer it over a said give me my damn phone and he called the police,police said it was a litagation issue when I talked to them and the thievery was not a 911 police matter .also if you look at the mama's of the 5 stars on this page you will find common ground in 85% of the names ! Today is day 19 one extra day from the last time I spoke with the liars at the phone clinic, I'll be returning to check in on things today with a real phone tech.and offer them one last chance to let them make it right,today ! The business is out of my way and would have never even went there had I not called ahead of time and was told the normal wait was a hour  ! I expect some kind of lie as a reply on here and I also feel I've been robbed by this business at this point !

Drove 45 miles to their store was told it'd be $300.00 just for parts.  Found another place that fixed it for $85.00 in 45 minutes. I hate being lied to to get business.\nEdit for reply:\nMy wife called Tuesday 1/5/21 and told whoever answered the phone, after telling them my issue (power button on my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus fell off). She was told that it wouldn't be a problem and no appointment needed that it'd be $79.00. As I mentioned before I live 45 miles away, I had to leave work early to make sure I had ample time to get there and to get service.\nYes, you are correct,  there was not a record or service ticket made because the guy there looked at my phone said that I'd have to leave it and that the parts would be $300.00 because the board would have to be changed out that the button was all one unit. I value my time and money as much as everyone else and I left without your service. Yes, I do feel like the initial phone call was a bait and switch just to get someone in the store. You know that $19.99 oil change costs $500 because you need tires,wipers, injector cleaning and \"blinker fluid\". It's just strange that my wife was told one thing and I was told another. I called another shop  told them exactly what was wrong, they said same thing. No problem, no appointment needed.  Took phone, they looked at it and the fixed it for the amount quoted.\nFunny thing that one shop said one thing and the other one did it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610116073880, "text": "Jason, I cannot find a repair ticket or record of your name, are you sure you have the right place? If so, I would like to reach out to you to find out what happened, as we do not give bogus pricing to obtain business. Mistakes do happen and if this indeed did happen, I'd love the chance to make it right!\n\nWe have a proven track record of being transparent throughout our entire repair process and we pride ourselves on having some of the best pricing in the industry. I especially appreciate this review because it gives me a chance to explain our repair process.\n\nBefore I start, i'd like to point out one thing, there is a giant discrepancy between $80.00 and $300.00. The only phone parts that cost this much are some of the Genuine Samsung Display Assemblies. If another shop was able to resolve this for $85.00, it was a small part repair, like a charging port or proxy sensor, for example. (If parts were needed.) My point is, our prices would have been comparable.\n\nWhen a customer calls in to obtain a price on a particular repair we do our best to go over the details of the problem or issue they are experiencing. If we are confident we know the solution to the issue at hand, we then will give you a price or at least a ballpark figure, so they know what to expect. If we are unsure what the solution is to the issue, we will ask you to bring the device in to be diagnosed, before giving you a price on the repair.\n\nThe Process.\n\n1. Once you come into our office, we go over the details of the issue you are experiencing with your device. We will then go over repair solutions or inform you that it will need further diagnostics to obtain the solution to the issue.\n\n2. We then obtain all your contact information and create you a ticket. We may at this time give you a price on the repair. Below are a couple normal situations.\n\n*Lets go over a couple examples, an iPhone 8, the screen is damaged, everything else on the device is working as intended (we verify this,) we give you a price on the display assembly replacement and an ETA for expected completion.\n\n*Now, lets say its a Gaming Computer, it is randomly turning off or blue screening. We will not know what the issue is without diagnosing all the hardware. In this situation, we will inform you that we will need to perform additional diagnostics to know what it will take to repair this device.\n\n3. Once we have obtained the device, we then will start the diagnostics or repair in the order that it came in. We have other repairs in front of new repairs. Your device will go into the queue and will be worked on when its ticket is next. There are two exceptions to this. Most phone screen repairs, if we have the parts on hand (which we do for all iPhones and some Samsungs,) are completed in an hour or less. (Time will vary depending on the particular repair.) The other exception is, we offer a rush service, this service is paid at the time of when you drop off the device. This is paid to have the device worked on immediately, otherwise tickets are worked on in the order they are received.\n\n4. Once the repair or diagnosis is completed, we then will email, text, and/or call you, to go over any final or further details.\n\n5. Pick up your device and pay for the repairs. Once a repair is completed you can come by and pick up your device at your convenience. We also offer payment options, you can pay in person with cash or card, or you can pay your invoice through our online portal.\n\n**One quick notes, due to COVID-19, we are not allowing our customers to wait on repairs in the lobby. They must either drop them off, wait in the their car, or outside of the building.\n\nJason, thank you for allowing us to go over this process with you and potential customers that may be reading this. Feel free to reach out to me, Clint Silver, owner at ProTek. I would love to know what happened and would love the opportunity to make it right. Thank you and as always, thanks for choosing ProTek!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I debated leaving this review because I know how harmful bad reviews can be to a small business. Unfortunately, my experience with ProTek was so disappointing I felt obligated to share.\nWhen replacing my screen ProTek compromised the integrity of my water resistant IPhone XS causing it to be hyper sensitive to moisture. This resulted in my phone being corroded by light water exposure only 3days after the iPhone repair. ProTek then refused to refund me the 200$ for the faulty screen replacement which essentially destroyed my 1000$ phone. Let me be clear that my IPhone had been exposed to water on previous occasions to the screen replacement with no issues. ProTek even assured me that there was no water damage prior to the screen replacement. I had expected to have a better experience with ProTek because I had confidence in their customer reviews. Sadly, I have to say I was dissatisfied with their services. At the very least I hope others will take my experience with ProTek into consideration and proceed with caution in regards to ProTek\u2019s remarkable ineptitude with apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589823914117, "text": "I am very disappointed by this review, i'll explain why. Unfortunately for phones, we are in the warmer months and people like to be on the water and when you're on the water, these type of things will happen. I want to start off by saying that we repair and/or recover data from thousands of water damage devices. When you first brought the iPhone in for a screen replacement it was because you left the iPhone in the rain and it ruined the screen. (We informed the customer that the screen was the only thing damaged by the rain.) We replaced the screen and put a new screen seal on it, (as we do with all repairs.) The phone then came back with standing water inside the device, this amount of water is concurrent with other phones we see that have been submerged into water. The customer asked for a warranty on the screen, unfortunately we cannot warranty water or physical damage. (Simply putting a new screen on this iPhone would not resolve the issue, given the current condition.) In a case like this, with standing water inside the device, we would need to let the water dry (we have tools to speed this process up.) After the water has dried, it will leave corrosion behind, which will need to be cleaned. We would then remove the logic board from the iPhone housing, clean it with our Sonic Cleaner, and then test the device for further component damage. We then would replace the components needed to repair the device. More than likely we could have saved this customers phone, had the customer let us complete the water damage assessment on this device.\n\nPlease remember that iPhone's are not water proof, they are water resistant, and each iPhone has its own water resistance rating. We have seen water damage happen in pretty much every way, from being in your pocket and sweating, to being on the bathroom counter while taking a shower, and to drops in the ocean. Each iPhone handles each exposure differently, because in each exposure, the conditions are different. If you are going to be around water, buy a water proof bag, put your phone into the bag and use it from the outside the bag, only to remove it if you need to make a phone call. This will drastically minimize the chance of water damage. I hope this reply has answered any questions as to how we handle water damaged phones here at ProTek. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want some friendly advice, feel free to contact us at your convenience!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

One week later, they've fixed my laptop, and it's up and running for less then what I paid for a new laptop!\n\nFantastic work! So before you take it to a national place, give the local guys at ProTek a chance to fix your laptop! You won't regret it !", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

They did the same troubleshooting things that I did and came to the same conclusion I did: a new motherboard would fix the problem. I accepted my fate. That was on Friday. On Monday I called and asked if there were anymore developments. They said the motherboard was the issue and that I could pick it up. I asked if the 30 dollars included tax. They said because it was an extended diagnostics period that the fee was now 45, to which I never agreed. I paid it anyway and when I got home I realized a fan was disconnected and so was my RGB LED strip. They didnt put them back the way I left it. On top of that, the pin header for the strip was bent and it snapped off when I tried putting it back in. I booted my system up using a different CPU and it worked fine, only I kept getting some error that wasn't there before. The broken pin and the error wasn't their fault, but they should've plugged the fan and strip back in and properly informed me  about the price hike from 30 to 45 dollars before I agreed to their terms. 3 stars because of the problems mentioned but I wont drop it down worse because I dont know how they could have fixed my computer.

I have the right to \"fire\" a customer who is not conducting themselves appropriately.\n\nMost notable is the fact that negative feedback was left for me, and it took ~5 minutes for the eBay rep to review the details and get it taken down.

Ordered a battery from Amazon and they couldn't get the back of the phone off.  So they call the Verizon retail store in hazel green and the girl told her to take it to ch pc repair and he would do it.  My mothers phone worked FINE when she took it in there.  She could do anything and everything on her phone.  When she went to pick it up the phone would not even turn on.   He said he tried both old and new battery and it still wouldn't come on.  So he took the screen off and put it on another phone and the screen works.  So he is saying that the mother board is messed up.  He can check it out BUT he'd have to charge her to do it.  Momma said he really messed the back up,  like it was melted!!  I met her up there and his attitude is  basically \"screw you \".  He insisted that the phone was not working when she took it in.  I asked him why he didn't call her and tell her and he said because she didnt leave a number.  To which my reply is \"when you work in customer service like this it is your responsibility to get a number so you can get in touch with the person\". He is a total jerk!!  He takes ZERO responsibility for his screw ups.  Said he was not going to make it right.  But he did tell her that he'd buy the phone from her when she bought a new one.  Then he threatened to call the cops on us \"because it was after hours, he was closed and we wouldn't leave\".  He never asked us to leave, period.  He brags about how much money he makes per year and all of his vehicles and house is paid for.  Good for him.  I dont give a \ud83d\udc01but what he has and doesn't have.

You came into my office, clearly disgruntled. You then continued to talk over me without giving me a chance to respond or explain the situation.\n\nPam visited my store with her device, which she believed to have a battery issue. She provided an aftermarket battery and had explained that an attempt was made, using a hairdryer, to open the casing and replace the battery, prior to me looking at the device. When the device was dropped off, I was in the middle of an extensive repair, as well as having a conversation with a different client. Not only that, but the device was dropped off quickly, without any contact information, and with very few details.\n\nI replaced the battery with the after-market battery she provided and then attempted to boot up the device, but to no avail. I investigated further but was unable to find a solution. Pam then arrived to pick up her device, and she was, understandably, very upset to find it not working. She wanted it in working order right then and there, and while I understand her sentiments, I can only do so much so quickly. I needed more time to troubleshoot and determine the problem and possible solution, but she would not allow it. I was even willing to reimburse her with a fair value for her device.\n\nI have been in business for more than 10 years now. I work hard every day, and I like to think that I am very good at what I do. I manage hundreds of computers monthly, and I repair and fix many devices daily (thousands of devices yearly). I can remove a device's back/screen in a few minutes with simply a bit of heat and some playing cards, and I have never had any issues. I would never damage a device intentionally. I treat all repairs as if they were my own. That being said, mistakes can (and do) happen as there are many risks involved with these repairs, but I do my best to make things right. To me, it's not just about collecting payment for the services I provide\u2014although that is necessary for me to stay in business and provide for my family. It's about building long-term relationships with my clients, and I deeply enjoy helping and providing knowledge to my clients.\n\nThis is the first complaint I have received with the BBB, and I would truly like to resolve the issue, and have the opportunity to change your outlook on me and your experience with my business. CH PC Repair is my business\u2014it has my name in it, a fact that I am proud of and would never change.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Harbin\nCH PC Repair"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623f52db6fed93:0x398f7a17a9216be3"}

I broke the screen badly the first time and the wonderful people at phone Probs worked diligently to fix it and make it like brand new again.\nAfter leaving phone Probs(extremely satisfied), I went to the Apple store to buy a phone case for my iPhone 7 Plus. The tech accidentally broke the screen on it and told me it was because the people who replaced my phone screen(He was implying Phone Probs) didn\u2019t instal it right. I was mad, as anyone would be, and I was very expressive in telling phone Probs they owed me a new screen for installing a faulty one. Now, I am a very very VERY  verbal person, and even after I fed them my 2 cents, 25 cents, and a few swear words in between, Drew and his wonderful father still stood by my side and tried to assist me. While they didn\u2019t replace it for free, they showed me how it couldn\u2019t have just broke and the Apple guy probably broke it and didn\u2019t own up to it, they helped me replace the screen and I am forever satisfied with this business again.\nThey are good people with hearts of gold. And they put up with a lot. And I meant ALOT. So next time you need a phone repair, laptop repair, or even computer, go see these guys at Phone Probs. They will do everything they can to help you be satisfied and keep coming back.\nI went from having an iPhone so badly bent and cracked that you couldn\u2019t even use it right to one that looks dang near new!

I took a chance and chose option one. He told me it would be by the end of the week before he even looked at it. To my surprise, I received a call from him on Wednesday to tell me my computer was ready. My computer works great now. Also, he didn't even charge me for an estimate.

I hired him to repair the circuit board in my welder. Paid him for the job, which only half of it was done. Asked him to replace all of the capacitors on the board. He did not.

I had to drive to Dothan to retrieve it from him and paid the balance of $145. Installed the board and the welder has no output at all now. Originally agreed upon price was $220. When I got the board back the diode was never reconnected, the solder joints were ridiculously poor. And the welder still does not work. He came out and wanted another $25 to \u201ccheck\u201d the board again. He came and \u201cchecked\u201d the board again. He said there is another bad part on the board. How could there be another bad part if he checked the whole board. So after seeing the poor workmanship displayed. I asked for a partial refund. He said no. So now I am out $235 and my welder still doesn\u2019t work. If I had only known that he couldn\u2019t do the job to start with, I would never have hired him to do it.
