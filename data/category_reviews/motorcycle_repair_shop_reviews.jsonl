Keep in mind they still had people walking in the door while they were working and still tended to those customers as well. I thought it was super cool that I could actually see them working on it and loved the layout of the place.

I was traveling back to south Mississippi on my motorcycle when I experienced a rear flat tire. I searched google for motorcycle repair shop in my area and tech46 appeared in search results. I contacted roadside assistance and requested to be brought to tech46. I waited for over 2 hours for someone from roadside assistance to come and tow me to tech46 for a tire repair, but could not get anyone to take my request. I contacted tech46 and spoke with Mr. Landers who stated that he was short handed due to the approaching holiday (July 4th) but would try and get someone to come and tow me in so I would not be stranded on the side of the road. After about 10 minutes, Mr. Landers telephoned me back stating he was on the way to pick me and my bike up and take it back to his shop and get me back on the road. Mr. Landers did exactly that, he arrived at my location with a trailer, loaded my motorcycle and brought it to his shop, Landers and his employees, Anthony and Dustin immediately began working on my motorcycle and had it repaired and returned to me fast, about 45 minutes. Landers, Anthony and Dustin were very courteous, professional and caring about making sure I was back on the road headed home, even though they were trying to close the business for the day. I would definitely recommend anyone who is in the Birmingham, Alabama area needing motorcycle repair, to look up tech46 for all your motorcycle repair needs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562637490729, "text": "We at TECH46 have traveled the globe over the past 4 decades on motorcycles - and i promise we have met many many difficulties along the way, and often times at the most inopportune times....but on every occasion total strangers have always pitched in to keep us moving no matter how difficult the obstacle! So of course we will pay it back to those like yourself who found a moment of difficulty on your own journey. We were happy to get you back on the slab!

That is too long for a service appointment. It makes me question how good the products really are...What good is the extended warranty if you can\u2019t use it? My ATV is basically new and I can\u2019t ride it. I will never purchase a Polaris product again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595942996413, "text": "Sorry for the unusual experience.

There was no pressure to buy today. Only the desire to listen so that could find the right machine for our needs and not the most expensive thing on the lot. Our salesman Spencer and the rest of the knowledgeable staff was able to answer every question that we had. The Staff also treated my wife with the respect that lacks in other dealer experiences . We left that day feeling like we have gotten a great deal and amazed at how friendly and respectful the staff is. We cannot say enough great things about the buying experience through Champion Powersports. The parts department has also been very knowledgeable and courteous while helping with parts and accessories for our ATV. The Polaris 570 utility edition that we purchased could not have been a better choice for our needs. This ATV has no trouble pulling the 950 pound trail mower we use on the farm or putting that smile on your face at the end of a hard days work . The 570 has more than enough power for the tough jobs or excitement out on the trail. The best way to describe the Polaris 570 utility edition and Champion Powersports is simple. The right tool for the job. Thank you to everyone at Champion for what you do.\nMatthew Porterfield", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b0cc039980d:0x789d8a26f66daf97"}

I had a horrible experience down the street at a large dealer who kept my Honda Rancher for two months the first time to replace the carburetor and flush the fuel tank. After I finally picked it up I took off to Ohio on a week long hunting trip only to have it ruined by a carburetor that wasn\u2019t installed properly. Matter of fact the 4 bolts that attach the carburetor were barely  finger tight causing fuel to leak into my air filter chamber. I came home and took it back for another 6 to 8 weeks and had to go sit in the waiting room to have someone actually work on my unit.   A week later after finally picking up my Rancher it wouldn\u2019t crank. A friend told me about Powersports Service Center and  Chuck and the team were amazing. My unit was fixed in three days and the real problem was found and corrected immediately. My Rancher runs perfectly now cranking with the slightest touch of the starter. Powersports Service Center will be the only people who ever  work on my equipment from now on. Oh yeah, the price was very reasonable to top it off.

The $30 per tire was a labor only quote that was made clear at the time the unit was quoted. Customer requested two new tires and when the tech disassembled the bike, noticed it was missing key safety strips on the rim, one tube was deteriorated, and replaced out of safety concern and the longevity of the repair. The additional items and Alabama mandatory tire sales fee were the only charges the customer wasn\u2019t aware of. The customer was phoned to be informed, but didn\u2019t  answer the phone during the servicing, so that we could make him aware of the extra needed items.  When the customer arrived to pick up the unit, and was presented the repair bill, he was adamant that he wasn\u2019t going to pay for the extra items, so it was offered to remove the items and return his original equipment.  In the end the shop owner marked down the cost of the repair and the shop gave the customer a free tube to help ease the cost of the repair. It was noted to the customer when he was there, that we can\u2019t estimate all unforeseen things needed in a repair until the actual job was being performed."}, "gmap_id": "0x88929342583cbd9d:0xac2bc6e61b898a61"}

This may not be the case in this particular situation, but in many instances maintenance becomes a can of worms, and if the machine is to work properly (for which it was brought to the dealership) there are additional things to be performed.

He called me the next morning! He took the time to explain things to me and quoted me so reasonably I added some more on the ticket that i thought I'd have to wait to get done due to cost. Totally impressed. Ryan is second to none. Will definitely be a repeat customer and send people his way.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286a10b287685:0x9201e36e7e8ccc1b"}

I knew from other shops that was High but I agreed to be there on Friday. I called a third time on Thursday to make sure Friday was still good as I had to take off work and it was a 2 hour drive for me. Rod said bring it on and he will take care of it. We got to Rods Performance around 8am Friday morning. I introduced my self but Rod just continued to eat his breakfast. Then his worker shows up and said what is that out side a Honda duki. Anyways when I approached Rod with the PC5 and the bike, he then tells me he did not plan to install the PC5 because that would take all day. He was just going to tune the bike for the sum of 380.00. I told home he was insane. He refused to do the work and I left for another 2 hour ride home. No apologies, very rude individual and unprofessional. I definitely would not recommend Rods Performance. Motorcycle Solutions in Montgomery put in the PC5 for 120.00 and Harley Davidson of Montgomery is going to put it on their DYNO and tune it. If I hadn't talked to Rod three different times I would have chalked this up to a misunderstanding but this is certainly not the case. The fact that he thought it was an all day project instead of the hour and 5 minutes that it took to put on, I would say he doesn't have a clue what he is talking about.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889b649d9686c6f:0x4b066602591676c"}

I told them that I wanted to get the carburetor cleaned  and to look over the go cart for anything else it needed. They called me the next day and said it had no compression. I told them that's odd because when I purchased the cart, I checked the compression and it was at 90lbs. They said I don't know what to tell you but we are only get 60lbs. AT this point I understood they didn't want to work on it and I picked it up and took it to Dr. Joe's in Ensley. They found the carburetor was gumed up and the vacuum line.

This was my second brand new $10,000+ Honda.  I recently purchased a $10,000+ KTM elsewhere (Not from Halls) because I could not get this dealer to work with me.\n\nFirst Red Flag, the bike had 14 miles on it at delivery.  I guess someone took it home for the night...  (They did disclose the mileage at the time of sale.)\n\nLater, I had some issues and wanted the bike looked at under warranty.  I was told they would charge me to look at it if they could not submit a warranty claim to Honda.  This is lack of basic customer service.  If you want your customers to come back you take care of them.  Take care of your customer and they will take care of you.\n\nLater still, I wanted to trade in my paid off bike that I purchased from them for a new one.  They told me if I wanted to trade in that they would \"give me a good price\" for my bike because I bought it from them and I'm buying another.  Great!!!, or so I thought...  They offered me about 80% of my motorcycles KBB Trade in Value.  80% of Trade In!!!  My bike is in like new condition, air conditioned garage kept!!\n\nSo long story short, I guess I am done with Mobile Honda.  I guess I wont rule out Halls in general...  Its kind of tough with them being the only game in town.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c55fd1ea6e1:0x29463d3329c58ec4"}

My original review was a bit critical, due primarily to my lack of experience working with dealers when buying a new bike.   Let me elaborate:\nDealership:  Original review was that this was a typical Harley Dealership,  however after visiting a few others out of the area, I would say it is above average.  Welcoming staff with good selection of bikes and gear, an overall comfortable environment to shop.\nFinance:  They definitely did not mess around with offering a solid interest rate out of the gate.  The finance person was great, explained all the numbers and answered all my questions.  The application process was easy and overall enjoyable.\nPricing:  Spot on pricing with MSRP.  Standard doc, destination fees, however there wasn\u2019t an additional mark up on the price.\nSales:  This is where the deal fell apart. Another dealer offered to include the new riders course ($250) and deliver the bike for free ( a little over 50 miles ).  Being my local Harley dealer and a member of the same owners group,  I thought this might be standard among the three shops. It was not.   When I asked if they would do the same, the answer was \u201cno\u201d.  Asked if that was a deal breaker, I replied yes and that was the end of that until I posted my review here online.\nA different sales person contacted me and tried to make the deal, unfortunately I was still annoyed and never really gave him a chance to try to work it out.\nOverall, I have no reservations giving this dealer a 5 star review after shopping around, the majority of the process was smooth and enjoyable.  After all is said and done would I go back and try again, absolutely.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621743788893, "text": "Very sorry to hear this, Ropa.

The GM reached out to me quickly and decisively and solved my most recent problem.  I was really impressed with what he said about his commitment to making the quality of service at Heart of Dixie as great as the quality of shopping and sales.\n\nORIGINAL POST on 10/15/2015... Loved the \"bike purchase\" part--5 stars.  Bought a brand new Vrod Muscle in 2011 and a new Road Glide Ultra in 2012.  Unfortunately, like so many other businesses out there, once you buy they forget all about you.  I'm speaking specifically about service--1 star.  The quality of service is fine--4 star, but the speed of service is what kills the rating for me--1 star.  Waiting two weeks on a regular basis to get your bike back is crazy.  That's been my experience on multiple occasions.  Counting today, five times, I've discovered problems as I'm about to go out of town on a ride.  They've been completely unwilling to work me in and help out so that I could make my trips.  Today was a little different.  I tried to get through to service and left messages beginning a 4 pm and now they've closed and still no call back.  I've had much better luck on service with Rider's Harley Davidson in Trussville.  Interesting to me that both stores are owned by the same man.  I've heard it said that the easiest customer to get is the one you already have.  In this particular case, I'll have to decide if the \"joy\" of owning a Harley is worth the aggravation of getting it taken care of!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1445528061992, "text": "Hi Bob, We're very happy that we were able to get this fixed for you.

I asked that he put the good motor on the good bike. We had a gentleman's agreement that I would pay more than a thousand dollars, and that would include two new tires. After looking closer at the tires I had I found that I had two good tires between the two bikes. I tried calling to check on the progress on my bike, but wasn't able to speak with anyone. Phill, the owner tells me, when I went in to check on my bike, that they got trash in my carbs. He had the carbs off my bike and was supposedly cleaning them. When he called me and told me my bike was ready I picked it up and only two cylinders was firing, the clutch was slipping, and the carbs were pouring gas. I took it back  the same day under the 30 day warranty to have it properly fixed. When he called me that my bike was ready and I went to pick it up he tries to charge me another $350.00. I called the police out to try and get my bike, but they said they couldn't get invovled and I would have to pay the money or get an attorney. I didn't trust him to leave my bike any longer, so paid the money to get my bike. My bike is sitting in my yard with the carbs still flooding out. After more than $1,400 dollars spent and I still can't drive my bike. If you value your property, do not take it to Prattville power sports. I'm getting an attorney and going to court.\n\nToday June 4, 2019, I had the pleasure of meeting the new owners of Prattville power sports. I had bought a new battery from phill when he done the work on my bike. Today I found out that the battery he put in my bike wasn't the same battery he said he put in. That it was a cheaper version, but he charges me for the more expensive battery. The new owner pulled out the old bills and showed me the difference and then gave me the battery that I was suppose to have from the beginning. I now believe and tmhave complete trust in the new owners and plan to do my business with them now that I know phill is gone.

I had been having problems with finding someone to work on my bike.  I have a \u201995 Honda VT1100c Shadow.  No one wanted to work on it because of it\u2019s age & my regular mechanic had closed up shop.  When I spoke to, Ronnie I explained what I wanted him to do.  I asked him how long would it take to complete the job.  He told him that it would be two weeks.  I agreed to that.  He came out to my house in late July to pick up my bike & take it to his shop.\nI waited the two weeks & gave him al call.  He said that he was still working on another bike & he was waiting for parts to come in.  I said, that was fine, I can wait for a few more weeks.  Two more weeks came about & he still hasn\u2019t gotten to it.  So, I just gave up & bought another bike in September.  I finally got a call from him on October 10th & 12:38 pm.  He said that he got it done.  I called him back & asked him how much it was, he said the total was $865.44.   I told him I would have to pick it up in a month. He agreed.  When I got there on November the 23rd to pick it up, he had flattened the rear tire.  He said  he broke the valve stem.  He told me he was going to charge me $75.00 to replace the stem that he broke.  I then asked him if we could start it, he said again, no.  The bike did have to be bottle fed.  So, I took it home.  When I got home I bottle fed it, it wouldn\u2019t start.  I called him & he said that it ran when he had it.  So, I asked him if he could look at it & see if he could figure out what was wrong.  He said that it would be two weeks & he would get $80.00 an hour to fix it.  Keep in mind, I just gave him the previous day, $865.00 in cash.  So, I took the carbs back off.  The only thing he changed was the diaphragms. The main jets, slow jets all were corroded & stopped up. He had the float heights all off.  He even used rubber hose for fuel line.  I called him back to ask for half a refund on it. I called him out on what he did.  When I told him that the jets were filthy & the carb bodies were filthy he stuttered & then told me that I am not getting sh*t back and hung up.  I wouldn\u2019t let this man work on anything.  The review on here before mine had a bad experience & they were there when I picked up my bike.  If I could give it negative starts if I could. These pictures below show what I got for my money. You can see that the bottom of the carbs are green & the jets are old & stopped up.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOikOY_9uySYZgFYs1yCu1pjr8BZtBxgR0_EOs=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhLhKb5HMQDNeqRvZbtmc8KlHnW95v1eurcwvz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfYMTVub6Q4n1Pl1qjaSVW3wzgg-2EQdl5Gce=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOohWrBi_KZuuZs2rloW7fiD3qhVAPjuRE0JFjC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLu6wYyOwVVADFo8rLp4GUUTVDDZj5Ase2sJ2S=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB8ELRalR_eFBXcm4HlSFtTC2gO2l35PHpvTYa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU5e-7LjQrUBNqmroCXFgKbwERuAmEQZdOySBK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgVwuVEVgOaOQnwAqi7YlwXUGSHFWBUeoRahs-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnMu7Z4WXFhh-wL7F6MitbO42L2Uzj1C27niZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2NUFL7xZB2E2_ba96Ko7Bd0NJFJ8rZ-zubAh6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzMI0yG2lwNxnXx4ddN8XuxyydEnCmQ480LnZK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt40-BH5IeCZHmqv2sKSd2wkMdHtAiFDnYzG02=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889bfdd2f410caf:0xf666e3cabfd567f4"}

Big Mistake.  He charged us $3500 plus to fix it.  He was clearly aware that it had set up.  The first time we went to get it, It would not start and the lights wouldn't work.  He ask how long has this gas been in here. My husband said 7 years remember you were supposed to drain the tank for me.  He even wrote it sat up for 7 years on the receipt.  He painted the front  fender with paint that didn't match.  He put a used rear tire on it and called it a new one.  It had dirt and clay mud on it and the bike wouldn't start so where would the mud come from on a new tire? .  We left it with him for obvious reasons.  My husband ask him to replace the bushing in the handle bars since we were leaving it anyway.We paid him in the beginning to change the light covers.  He charged us twice the original one he ordered we found in the saddle bags.    My husband starts home on it today.  The brake light would not go off and the mirror was just spinning. You would think he would have saw that when replacing the bushing in the handlebars. My husband gets to Arab while driving the brand new war bonnet on the fender fell off.  Oil is leaking from a bike that he supposedly changed the oil and fixed the clutch on it.  We paid this man 3700 plus and he didn't take enough pride in his work to even wipe the dust off the bike.  I was using his shop rag to do that while we were waiting to get it running last week.  He literally took it out of my hand.  When I first met him i told my husband he seems like a good Christian person.  Boy was I wrong he might be a Christian.  I have no Idea but good is far from the truth.  We are very upset with the way we were ripped off.\nWe took our bike to another shop because it was obvious that Ronnie did not change the tires, the battery, fix the carburetor or anything we ask him and paid him to do. They could not believe that anyone would say the changed tires when they were literally rotten around the rim because it had set up for 7 years. He really screwed us out of 3700.00 He is a dishonest man. The Battery was 7 years old yet he said it was new.
