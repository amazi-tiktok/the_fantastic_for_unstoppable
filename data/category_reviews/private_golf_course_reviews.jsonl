It is not the best maintained course, but the conditions did not alter my round in any way.

A lot of the holes have hazards that if you hit driver you will be in trouble, so you really need to play smart. I hit mostly long irons and hybrids off the tee and had no trouble finding fairways and parring.

Played in 4 hours although my foursome had to wait quite a bit on the group in front of us. Greens were in great shape but they were pretty slow. Probably keeping them a bit longer due to the heat. An employee came around and gave us iced towels twice on the back nine which was greatly appreciated bc it was in the low 90's with very little wind. There are a few holes where water comes into play so be careful on those holes, otherwise it's pretty straight forward. It's probably a little overpriced but they took good care of us. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5*'s. This was my second time playing this course and it can play over 8,000 yds. if you enjoy that kind of punishment.
