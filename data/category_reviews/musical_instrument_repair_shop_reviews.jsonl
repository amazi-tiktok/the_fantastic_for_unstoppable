We only paid  $50 for her new clarinet on Craigslist and would have put the  $200 into buying her a nicer one instead of paying to fix the one she has.

I asked other parents and had received the same answer. My son took lessons from Nancy Hallman and Phyllis Peterson over a period of seven years. Both instructors were excellent. He went from being a sub-par beginning musician to making district band in a few months and made superior ratings every year there after. It was an astonishing change.\nI had a co-worked who had a junior in high school and she was at the bottom of the barrel musically, she was in the schools \"C\" band as the only upper class man. I called Nancy Hallman and handed my co-worker the phone and told her to set up lessons. She set up lessons and her daughter took lessons from Mr. Peterson, two months later she made district band. The next school year she made the school jazz band after 5 months of lessons. This young lady is now a music major at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Hallmans transformed this student that had no passion for music into a musician.\nMy son played the alto sax, I noticed year after year that 7 of the 8 sax players in district band members were Hallman's students, both at the middle school level and high school levels. State honor bands were the same way, Hallman's students. One of my son's peers was awarded the top musician in the state his senior year in high school.\nAfter reading some of the other reviews here I would make the following observations:\nIf you want to put a pacifier in your kid's mouth buy a $50 instrument off Craig's list and have your kids dissatisfied and frustrated from playing an unplayable instrument, then this is probably not the place for you.\nIf Hallmans replace additional pads, it was because they presumed that you wanted an instrument that could actually be played by a student. My experience is when you think a pad or two is leaking and you fix it, you will find the next pad leaking and it was not particularity identifiable until you fix the two pads with the more significant leak.\nIf you want to raise a kid with skilled music instruction and the self esteem from being a good musician, then you have found the right place. The instructors are phenomenal.\nI was always treated fairly with the sales and service and I ended up with a highly skilled musician who I am very proud of.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626bbf454edaef:0x7eab6ee1903e8f2b"}

I wasn't looking for anything other than to let them know that a substandard battery had been installed. When we brought it in initially, we asked for the strings to be changed and the battery replaced. No one told us at that time that we weren't being charged for the battery, just that what we asked for was $30, if I had been advised of that I would have either asked for a better battery or brought my own.

Once again she listened to me and my concerns instead of trying to get me to spend more money than i needed. I'd give this place 100 stars if i could but unfortunately 5 stars is the max. I'll be heading back in a few weeks  for more supplies even though i could just order online. Guitar Pro's LLC has made me into a loyal customer.

It is without hyperbole my favorite place on planet Earth.\n\nIf you are a fan of indie folk/Americana music Tangled String needs to be on your bucket list of listening rooms. Not only do they book amazing acts for a very intimate and cozy venue, but the sound quality is the best I've heard anywhere. The music is always comfortably loud, perfectly balanced and clear as a bell -but you could also hear a pin drop (or beer open). I've never left with my ears ringing. I don't know how they do it.\n\nThe atmosphere is so welcoming and relaxing. If you've ever showed up to a venue and felt like you just didn't belong there - don't worry about that coming to Tangled String. Plus, you will never have to wedge yourself against a sweaty stranger or have your vision blocked by a tall person. There is a comfortable seat for every ticket holder. Seats are not selected at purchase, they are on a first come first serve basis but every seat is fantastic (I know. I've sat in most of them and I'm very short).\n\nThis is a BYOB venue and yes, people bring small coolers. I love that I'll never be over charged for cheap wine in a disposable plastic cup, pay $4+ for water, or have to settle for Pepsi if I want a Coke. (They're also one door over from Piper and Leaf so great local tea is just a step away.)\n\nThe owners and employees are incredibly active in our local community and in the surrounding music community. They have an amazing reputation among artists and patrons. You can feel good about where your money is going when you buy a ticket.\n\nAs long as this review is I just can't say enough good things about Tangled String.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1545148269087, "text": "Thank you, Andrea!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbcca324b2d:0xeaed3a7ed65f20dd"}

What you need, may not be what you describe, especially if you are not guitar hardware expert yourself. I am one of those people that I know what I need, but I don't think I explain it well.\n\nKevin was able to decipher exactly the action and string set up I want/need.

Experience and talent cannot overcome action that is set in a manner that runs contrary to your style and ability, and bad intonation will make even the best player sound off or out of tune in different areas of the neck.\n\nThere is simply no way around the fact that proper set up and maintenance of guitar is key to beautiful guitar playing.\n\nI also had a problem with the cable jack and he repaired that as well.\n\nHis pricing is fair, his work top notch and his experience and talent for the craft are better than anyone I've ever worked with to achieve the sound I'm looking for.\n\nNo doubt that as long as he is working, no one else will be working on my guitars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb4ceb1599873:0xf3793ecdb376d4a2"}

Man, I waited WAY too long.\n\nKevin Williams of The Guitar Spa is a great musician, but that is by no means the extent of his artistry. He possesses the ability to transform simple guitars into wondrous pieces of art. Allow me to illustrate.\n\nI brought to him a beat up, secondhand Squier Tele (yes, a Squier) which had intonation issues, poor sustain, a scratchy bridge, and mediocre playability. HAD.\n\nAfter brief discussion, Kevin recommended a new nut (Tusq) and a setup as the cure for most of the problems. He also mentioned that a new bridge (which I had been wanting for quite some time) would increase sustain and get rid of the palm scratching. I took his advice and requested he order whatever part he believed would be most suitable. The friendliness and customer service throughout the entire process was superb and sincerely focused on improving my enjoyment of this instrument. This was an entirely different atmosphere than I\u2019ve experienced at instrument retail stores who do service/repair on the side.\n\nThe guitar I got back was not the same one I dropped off. Intonation\u2014flawless. Sustain\u2014dream worthy. Scratchiness\u2014gone. Playability\u2014hundreds of dollars above a Squier\u2019s league.  And the Tusq nut was an extra surprise! Noting the color scheme (black, cream) and future mods I had planned for this Tele (which we chatted about briefly), Kevin ordered a black Tusq nut to accent the body color and add a unique vibe to the instrument. Incredible.\n\nIf you\u2019re anywhere within a few HOURS drive of The Guitar Spa, make the drive. I will.

I've taken him simple setups and got back a model of what a perfectly playing guitar should be asking with being ultra clean and lusterously shiny. He may charge a little more than the others but when you drop your guitar off with him you don't have to worry about getting your guitar back dinged up and missing parts like some big box stores with the word \"center\" in their name... That sells guitars. If you want a personal tech that you can trust and use for life this is your go to guy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb4ceb1599873:0xf3793ecdb376d4a2"}

I didn't really think about writing a review after the first guitar that I bought there, but now that I have another experience from a major purchase I just had to say something to the public.\nOver the years I have also purchased smaller items because it was convenient to me to stop by and get things like cables, picks, capos, and other little odds and ends for guitar and bass that I use. This time I bought a relatively inexpensive guitar there; an epiphone Les Paul special, in the TV yellow color. I even traded another guitar towards it.  I thought they were very fair on their trade value and reasonable in their explanation of how that works. The reason I feel like I had an exceptional experience was they treated me very good even though the $ value I was spending wasn't that high. Looking back I was thinking that I don't think I could have gotten a better experience even if I had been purchasing a $2,500 Gibson! I felt like a valued customer and they answered all of my quirky questions and help me find a hardshell case that was in my budget and I am very happy with the final price and how the deal worked out.\nPlease go patronize this business. They deserve it because they work hard for their customers and they let you know if something is within their ability to produce or not. They have my business from now on because of how I was treated on this deal and looking back on other deals too. I think their prices are fair they are better than retail.

An outrageous markup.\n\nAll of this was after agreeing to a monthly payment for an instrument only to be informed the day before it was needed that they didn't have any in stock so we had to scramble to find a different option.

But this one man that works there is not the friendliest and makes me and my music buddy never wanna come again... I was gonna buy at least $20-$60 of stuff, and my buddy was gonna get his guitar worked on, but we decided against it after our experience today.\nMy friend and I were playing our guitars together at moderate volumes. No louder than the other customers that passed through. Our volume knobs probably were set around 1. This rude clerk guy came up to us and told us \"turn it down, there are customers in here\". When there was maybe 1 other guy in the guitar room at most. What are we, trash? Are we not customers?\nThough to be fair, there was a little kid who sat behind us who was louder than both of us combined, and he was tremolo picking the most random nonsensical annoying noise (future shredder?), but he should've told the kid to turn down\u2014not us. We both turned our amps off because he was rude the last time we were in the store and we were pretty annoyed at this point. But the kid turned his amp down and continued the random picking and the dude immediately came back and said \"hey, okay, turn it off, that's enough for today\" and took the guitar from the kid. The rudest music store clerk we've ever encountered. There's another guy who is super nice that works there who let us turn the volume up\u2014at least 2 or 3 times what we did today\u2014and test every amp in the store. We bought a $2,000 setup from the nice guy in the past, but this rude guy would probably kick us out of the store before we could make a purchase. I didn't catch his name, but he's average height, blondish, his hair is thinning, and he had a short beard. A nicer worker told us he's been there 3 years, though I'm not sure how he's lasted that long.

I started looking at some envelope filters and some guy came out of the back trying to tell me that envelope filters are only for bass players. Told him about the dead and others, and he changed his stance from \u201cauto wahs are for bass only\u201d to \u201cwell the mu-trons are for bass and the Q-trons are for guitar\u201d.\n\nFirst of all, Jerry Garcia, Trey Anastasio, Keller Williams and countless others use mu trons in their guitar rigs. Second, the Q-tron is just a pedal made by EHX that\u2019s also an envelope filter. Hell people use MXR\u2019s bass envelope filters on their guitar rigs. So the overall musical knowledge when it came to pedals wasn\u2019t very high in my experience.\n\nAlso, when I went to trade my partscaster in, the guy offered me $125 for it. I later learned that this was a pretty bad lowball, as I got offered $200 at a much smaller guitar store. At first I said $125 was fine, if he would bring the price on a boss envelope filter down from $130 to $125. The guy said no, on a five dollar difference. I ended up taking my guitar somewhere else and (thank god) getting $200 for it.\n\nI\u2019m giving this place two stars because they did have a large selection.

Basically, I took my brother to trade a PRISTINE first-owner amp, and we could prove it, in for a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe, used, which is of equal value....and my brother coughed up $100.\n\nI took off work to take him to initially buy the thing. I took off work to bring it in for repair when we discovered sticky crap on the power tubes, and I ended up working until 10PM thanks to these guys. They wanted me to take off work again, after having spent 5 hours in their store. I basically spoke up and said, he might be the customer, but I'm the wheelman, and I'm furious. I mentioned the fact of the wasted gas, wasted trips, and the at least 6 hours of driving they were expecting of me.\n\nThey checked OUR amp out very thoroughly, and even treated my brother like a criminal, saying they are getting his DL in case he stole it. SERIOUSLY people....\n\nI tried to talk some business sense with them, asking them to do something for the trouble, and it would not have taken much. They said no. Then I asked if they can just reverse everything since ALL of the stuff was still in the store.... The guy made up a story of a law, which actually doesn't exist, then claiming he has to charge extra to reverse it all. Guitar Center evidently doesn't know about this (fake) law.\n\nNot ONLY that, but the smug, d-bag attitude that the guy gave me when pushing my brother, his CUSTOMER aside to say \"you don't think we're trying to rip you off do you?\" He did this to put me on the spot, and tried to make me look like the bad guy.\n\nIn the end, my brother spent another $170 to get a new model. In the end, he got what he wanted, but we are both appalled by how the guy behaved to our faces. Beware, their used gear has NO warranty, but they represented at sale that they would ensure the gear works if something went wrong like the day we get it... Well... it did.\n\nYou don't take someone's $700 amp + $100 and then give them junk, and not try to do something proper after dragging someone thru hell. That's the bottom line. I tried more than the guy at this store. You won't catch us in that place again.\n\nConsidering the tens of thousands that my brother spent with other companies, Bailey Brothers missed an opportunity... Not good business. Dishonest, rude, and outright condescending.  Smiled at us when we expressed our frustration with the runaround....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc388424995:0xdcd777d1864df053"}

I hired him to repair the circuit board in my welder. Paid him for the job, which only half of it was done. Asked him to replace all of the capacitors on the board. He did not.

I had to drive to Dothan to retrieve it from him and paid the balance of $145. Installed the board and the welder has no output at all now. Originally agreed upon price was $220. When I got the board back the diode was never reconnected, the solder joints were ridiculously poor. And the welder still does not work. He came out and wanted another $25 to \u201ccheck\u201d the board again. He came and \u201cchecked\u201d the board again. He said there is another bad part on the board. How could there be another bad part if he checked the whole board. So after seeing the poor workmanship displayed. I asked for a partial refund. He said no.
