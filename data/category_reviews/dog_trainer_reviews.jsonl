My son Matt was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at age 4. After reading an internet article on Diabetic Alert Dogs (DAD\u2019s) my wife and I was motivated to find more about how a DAD could improve the quality of life for Matt and our family. We found many stories of success and quite a few horror stories as well. In our search, we ran across the name of a dog trainer in our area, Frances. I called Frances and told her our story. I told her of our fear of Matt going to sleep and not recognizing a low then going into a seizure. I told her of how we feared Matt coming up on driving age and getting in the car after practicing sports and not realizing a low blood sugar and having a seizure while driving. We had these fears because Matt had seizures due to failure to recognize the signs and symptoms of low blood sugars. I was hoping Frances could point me in some direction but she did much more than that. After hearing our story, she told me she worked with a service dog organization but their organization had never trained a DAD but if we were willing to work with her she would do her best to help. We did and so did she. Frances and Ashley worked to develop was has become a very successful Diabetic Alert Dog Training program at Service Dogs of Alabama.

This review will be long but also describe my experiences so that people can get a good idea of the company. The first course I took with them was Impulse Control with my dog Arnold. He and I had completed beginner and intermediate obedience courses with another company.\n\nWe just happened to go to Love Them Train Them for Impulse Control because their schedule better matched ours at the time. Meredith Dempsey, is a great teacher to human and pup students.\n\nWe learned so much-got much more out of it than I ever dreamed. I decided to take Arnold to their tricks training course. They were very transparent that while they teach the how, not all dogs may be able or may want to do all of the tricks. The company emphasizes force free training and they follow through with this. HOWEVER,  the trainers, Rebecca (owner and trainer) and (Ally-trainer) made it so much fun that Arnold would come home and just offering to do tricks.\n\nWhile we were taking the tricks training course, we ended up adopting a dog (Ginger) from a shelter. The trainers at this company had all worked with her at the shelter (she was being considered to become a fire dog at one point) and know of her excitability and energy levels. I mention that to mention that I chose to enroll her in beginner obedience.\n\nAnother company had evaluated her temperament for daycare purposes and considered Ginger reactive and unable to do daycare or interact with other dogs safely at the time. They suggested reactive dog training courses. Now, we already had Arnold. Arnold is pretty chill so I figured they would get along. For me, it was rough at the beginning because it was an adjustment for all of us and a first in regards to having a multi dog household.  It wasn't love at first sight but Ginger was not reactive towards Arnold.\n\nI brought up my concerns with Love Them Train Them. Meredith suggested I get a second opinion regarding daycare and suggested a specific daycare. Ginger did very well and the staff at that daycare were quite surprised that I had been told Ginger needed reactive dog training before going to daycare.  Rebecca and Ally reassured me that Ginger has great learning abilities and that Anthony (the one currently teaching the beginner obedience course we are taking) would be excited to have us.\n\nI reached out to Anthony before the course regarding the other company's thoughts as to Ginger being unable to take a beginner obedience course until a reactive course was taken. Anthony (who had worked with Ginger a good bit at the shelter-so I am sure that helped) told me he would make it work. And he has. The improvement in the past month has been incredible. Ginger does need a little more classroom modification that the other dogs but bit by bit, the modification is becoming less and Ginger is continuously improving. Even though Ginger already knew Anthony, watching him work with the other dogs has me fully convinced that even she hadn't know him, she would still do well.\n\nDuring all of this, Ginger and Arnold had been getting used to each other. And me, used to having two dogs. Some things came up that caused me to question Arnold's and Ginger's capability of safely living together. But, when I reached out to Meredith (who knew and had worked with both dogs) she told me that both Arnold and Ginger are great communicators and to trust in my dogs' ability to communicate. This helped me to relax during their interactions (they love to play rough) which in turn helped them better enjoy others' company.\n\nI could add so much more but in a nutshell: Love Them Train Them only uses force free methods, packs in a lot into one class, are willing and capable to work with what others may see as problematic, and their classes are fun!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620268808725, "text": "Wow!

Luckily, he was already about 70 lbs. and held his own but has been a different dog since. The owners at Infinity listened to what we had to say (the place near home said he was an aggressive dog) and wanted to charge accordingly. Infinity had us being Bailey in FIRST to gauge how he acts. He knew it was a mix of anxiety and impulse control. Having trained dogs for years, LaDale knew we needed to work on those two areas. In 4 sessions we already see an improvement. He is more relaxed around strangers and doesnt jump straight to 10. Today was the 1st time we introduced another dog and he was anxious but did better than expected. We are glad we found them.

The workers leave dogs in pee and poop filled kennels for hours before they are cleaned.\nThe dogs don't go outside from 4pm to 7am the next day.\nThey have had 2 cases of kennel cough since spring break, and have still been using the same sponge to clean all of the dog bowls.\nIf your dog is having a health issue while boarding, the workers will not tell you about it if they don't think it's serious. There are dogs who get incredibly sick either from stress or other health problems that result in blood in the vomit and/or stool. The only thing they do is take the dogs food and water away and don't let them outside.\nThe dogs water bowls are only checked at 7am and then again at 4pm. So your dog may be going without water for any number of hours between those times and the workers will ignore it. The bowls are only cleaned once per day, so if your dog is boarding for several days, there's a very good chance that they'll have the same bowl of water over the course of their stay. They have a major rat problem there, so often times there is rat feces in the water bowls.\nThe dogs are left alone all night with the rats, which your dogs could be eating over night, making them very sick and possibly catching diseases.\nThe workers do not have first aid training, so if your dog chokes on the mulch that is outside in the play area, then they are told to \"look up an instructional video\" to help the choking dog.\nThey don't pay attention to what the dogs are doing because they're too busy on their phones to care. So if your dog poops mulch (very bad for his digestive system) then it's because they were eating it from the play area. There are also several dogs who eat poop, so if your dog has that habit, it's probably only getting worse because they think they're allowed to do it while staying there.\nWhen the dogs are playing outside, they are sometimes not given water for several hours due to certain dogs not liking the water hose.\nI have witnessed a coworker giving the wrong dog her medicine. Once that realization was made, still nothing was done about it.\nIf your dog is not good with other dogs, they are set as \"individuals\" where they play by themselves. These dogs are only getting 10 minutes outside to play, and then they get 10 minutes inside to play. They are supposed to have another 10 minutes to play but are usually skipped because the workers want to go home early. So if your dog is boarding over the weekend and they're not good with other dogs, then they're only getting about 20 minutes of outside time every day while the other dogs get over 2 hours.\nThe weekend hours are different, so all of the play groups are shortened and the dogs are left alone for a lot longer than they normally would be.\nTheir medicine is put in pill pockets in their food. If the dog doesn't voluntarily eat the pill pockets, then that dog will not be getting their medicine that day.\nThe dogs only have access to their food for a couple hours a day. So if your dog is a grazer and doesn't eat all of their food at once then they will be eating very little over the course of their stay.\nThe kennels are painted very poorly, paint is always chipping off the walls, usually because dogs are chewing it off.\nWorkers regularly spray dogs in the face with Bitter Apple spray. This spray is supposed to be used for dogs that have problems chewing their fur, and is not meant to be sprayed in the eyes or nose of the dogs, but they are regularly sprayed in the face if they are barking in their kennels.\nIf you request for your dog to be given a bath, they will usually bathe the dogs very early in the day to get it out of the way. Once they're bathed, they are not allowed back outside and their food and water bowls are taken away. So if you dropped your dog off at 8am to be picked up around 5pm, there's a good chance that your dog hasn't been outside or had food or water since about 10am.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519324162478, "text": "Hi Lori, I wanted to reply here as well since I did not hear back from you regarding this same review you left on Facebook.\nI'm truly sorry this is how you felt about working at CDT.\n\nAs one of the owners, and the person responsible for systems management in the locations I am very upset to hear these things.

I picked the five lesson package with my new dog to make sure I was starting my new dog off on the right foot. Ken said he usually has a set plan for the 5 sessions but was very able to tailor his approach to assist with my prior experience and the time I could afford to spend with my dog each day. I would say that whether you are a beginner or have considerable experience this trainer is for you! Some trainers are quick to use tools without teaching the dog or the owner the correct way and Ken's approach was always in the dog's best interest.The sessions were fun and worked well with what I was working on with my dog daily in my home. The lessons also tired my dog out considerably and he was definitely wiped out because I worked his brain with the training. In between training days, I took my dog on a five mile hike and he was equally as tired after a one hour training sessions with plenty of breaks! Ken's approach was directed on helping me figure out the best way to communicate my directions to my dog. I take my dog to the dog park to continue practice our training in a large, controlled environment and when other dog owners come to let their dogs play are always incredibly impressed with the way my dog responds to me off leash and on. I can have my dog respond reliably to commands 20+ feet away and when playing with other dogs which is more than I can say for most people I have seen with their dogs at the parks. I can't recommend Ken and his training style enough. We even got the opportunity to meet some of his dogs and see what my dog and I can aspire to.

If you want to own a large breed and/or highly intelligent dog, you need a trainer to show you the proper way to gain trust, confidence, and mutual respect. I have worked with a lot of different trainers in states where we have been stationed and hands down Ken (owner of Heart of Dixie) is phenomenal. As a novice dog owner or new to training, you always want to interview trainers and see what they do with their own dogs. It speaks volumes!\n\nMany trainers will work \u201cmiracles\u201d with the aid of an e-collar and your dog is ready to go in 3 weeks or so. How many of those trainers have e-collars on their own dogs for every day life? What are you going to do if the batteries aren\u2019t charged or the collar misfires? A dog needs a foundation, confidence, and be able to think on their own for dependability. An owner needs to put in the work and follow through with the training plan to hold up that foundation. Then one may want to add an e-collar for off leash reliability on hikes or very rare circumstances.\n\nIf you want a trained dog that will listen to you, go with Ken. Ken is beyond educated in his field and most importantly can read you and your dog quicker than you can say hello. I had spent 2 years doing private classes with other trainers so I\u2019m a little more particular and experienced than most, but by no means am I professional trainer. I reached out to Ken on a Friday and the following week he was at my house doing a 3 hour consult! He gave me a few new tools I needed for my rescue German Shepherd Puppy that I did not use for my prior GSD. He boosted my confidence in my prior training and gave me homework with resources to back it up.\n\nMy husband, with no formal training experience beyond a big box puppy class 5 years ago, was able to ask endless questions to curb his frustrations. Within 6 hours of Ken leaving our house, my husband commented that our 6 months old shepherd was already walking A+ for him (compared to the average C walk they were getting). This is all with a regular collar and leash... you read that correctly... walking a rescue that we have had for 6-7 weeks with no prong, no slip, nor e-collar. They were finally on the same page together and ready to go. They still have bonding to do, but the tone has been set.\n\nWe will be utilizing Ken in the near future for check-ins (fine tuning), training with another dog present, and more advanced public settings. Please note all of this will be done while I\u2019m approaching my third trimester of pregnancy and after with a newborn plus our other young children. Our goal is a dog that is so well behaved he can go anywhere, and in return we are committed to putting the time in. There are no excuses when it comes to training. You only need 10-15 minutes sessions with your dog a few times a day to keep you both on the same page.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600031508881, "text": "Thank you Michelle for this very thorough and honest review about us here at Heart Of Dixie Dog Training LLC.

This is where Ken shines; with his expert advice and intervention, his business Heart of Dixie Dog Training can help you improve and nurture that special bond you have with your dog/dogs. I have a 3 year old black German Shepherd named Nova. She is my pride and joy! But a couple years ago, I was feeling so helpless - like I was failing her. She was hyper; she was wayyyy too smart for her own britches; she was out of control. I wanted to work on basic commands and training, but I had young children to take care of as well, so that fell to the wayside. Luckily, I was referred to Ken and I enrolled in the group classes he taught in Enterprise at the time. Once a week, we would get together with our pups and put in the work. Ken taught me how to create that trusting connection with Nova, sensing her needs and behaviors, and vice versa. We quickly mastered \u201cPlace,\u201d \u201cDown,\u201d \u201cStay,\u201d \u201cCome,\u201d as well as no pulling on the leash and other helpful commands. With the help of HOD Dog Training, we built a great foundation from the ground up, using positive reinforcement and certain commands that would ensure I, the owner, was the leader and she was the follower. Now, I really feel like we have laid the groundwork and could accomplish anything.

The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent. This facility is anything but transparent!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb344b45a6c63:0x685d3a5c7b681a37"}

Shaking, limping and handed dirty bedding with no explanation as to how he was injured, why we weren't informed  when it happened plus finding out he'd been very stressed by being kenneled every night in the large room with the large dogs with big dog barks! When I first boarded @ Piper's 2 years ago I requested that he be kenneled at night with only little dogs and was shown a room off the hall on the right where I was told the small dogs stayed. When I asked why he was put in the big room this time with the big dogs she said \"well, you didn't request that he be separated\". If my file had been consulted I'm sure it would reflect my wishes. There was no I'm sorry we didn't contact you about his injury, etc. He literally had to be carried that night and Christmas day every time to potty, to food bowl, etc. While I understand this may not be the norm @ Piper's, ( had never happened to me before) since it happened this time, I'll be making other arrangements next time. Beware. Things are not always as they seem. Ask to see where your dog will be put at night. I was told they  NEVER allow tours! That's shocking! I've ALWAYS toured where I board my dog. Ask what their policy is if your dog becomes injured or sick. I asked when the owner would be there as I wanted to speak in person with them and was told the owner was never at the Anniston location.

I am certain that they are safe when boarded at Harvard's. I made a pre-board visit to their facility before I made my first reservation. I was impressed by their setup and the way that they explained to me exactly how my dogs would be accommodated. There is no question that the staff at Harvard's is professional and puts the safety of each dog first.\n\nDuring a cross country move my dogs boarded at Harvard's for over a month to ensure that they would be safe during the transition. It was the right thing to do, but let's be honest, no one wants to board their dogs for that period of time. Miraculously, even after having boarded for so long, my dogs still jump in circles when I ask them if they want to go to Harvard's. Unbelievable. If they had not been treated well they would fight me tooth and nail before placing one whisker back in the facility. Knowing, without a doubt, that my dogs are going to be happy and enjoy themselves when they are boarded makes me feel comfortable making plans to travel in the future.\n\nBecause of our positive experience boarding my dogs have become more involved by attending the dock diving classes offered by the center.  Lori, the instructor, is exceptionally patient with them. The attention and training that she gives my dogs has benefited them tremendously. One of my dogs has mobility challenges due to having bad knees. Getting in the water with Lori every week has changed his life. It is a joy to see him run around with abandon after his swim lessons. I will admit that I have shed a tear over seeing him come so far in his recovery. He would not be at his current activity level without attending Harvard's dock diving classes. I am extremely grateful that Harvard's and Lori provide a much needed outlet for my dog and others with similar needs.\n\nOn a human note, I also enjoy the class time spent outside with good people and enthusiastic canine company. Harvard's is located on a lovely piece of land and there is a lot to enjoy about their meticulously dog friendly setup. Attending a dock diving class is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon and I encourage you to try it!

Although I should have taken heed, I did not and my dog continued to attend day care regularly. I began noticing that my dog was very timid of the staff. In particular, she was called by one of the managers/trainers and immediately backed up, tail between her legs, and laid down in a submissive position behind me. This time I took note and my dog never returned to the facility. I still have pre-paid day care days that will go unused.

He hasn't learn any commands the exact same one's that he already  knew before leaving. The reviews Dylan business have can't be true ,I'm so disgusted  with how he treated Kam.As for the dogfights I'm sure Kam has been in ,Dylan had the nerves to say it was dog play.That  came from the many dogs he had on the yard .Today Kam has a visit with the Vet because I'm not sure of what kind of damage that has been done to him.And to get the many scaring he have checked and also to make sure that he's going to be okay due to the major weight loss. I'm trying to  figure how to add pictures to this review as proof.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888973ecbee02af7:0x2cdee12e498be901"}

When I got there, he just called over the loud speaker \u201cBring Jackson [their test dog] into room [blah, blah, blah];\u201d then he took my dog on a leash all the sudden and in approximately two minutes he came back out saying that my dog just \u201csnapped at the other dog the whole time.\u201d\n\nMy dog definitely barks and cries when on a leash when she sees other dogs\u2014she wants to do what\u2019s natural to her (sniff the other dog\u2019s butt and go play). However, she does well, on or off the leash, meeting other dogs if properly introduced.  I\u2019ve boarded my dog before in several places; she\u2019s had dog sitters and even walkers that come to pick her up with other dogs;  I\u2019ve have always been told how sweet she is with other dogs\u2014those other places probably know more about dog behavior than these guys.  I take my dog to different dog parks regularly and I see myself that she does well with other dogs in her own terms or with me guiding her if needed.\n\nI didn\u2019t really care in the end whether they accepted or not.  It\u2019s their loss in the end. They turned away a perfectly sweet dog and loss hundreds of dollars plus future business. I was looking to board for 11 days while I\u2019ll be in Europe and then again later this summer for a shorter trip.  It\u2019s their loss, not mine.  And if they have no record of my being there\u2014well I did take my intake sheet after they failed my dog so why would you have my info? I called to verify my appointment the day before, though,  so I would certainly hope that they have some record that my dog was there and was \u201cfailed,\u201d lol!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528030537000, "text": "The Dog Ranch Resort is a dog social environment, our temperament test dog has met over 3000 dogs of various sizes, and breeds. Our process is proven to work and is comparable to doggy daycares around the country. The reason we use a leash is to simply get your dog back into the temperament test room. Once your dog gets back there they are simply free to sniff one another.\n\nHowever, your dog did not want to interact and showed extreme signs of separation anxiety. When Jackson attempted to approach she snapped at him. Due to the fact that she was anxious and reacted in an aggressive manner shows that this environment would be too stressful for her. If she can not handle meeting one dog then it is not fair to subject her to a pack of dogs and jeopardize the safety of our other clients.

My dog boards at Camp Scotty in Pelham sometimes and it is awesome. I saw the Dog Ranch Resort website and it looked similar. I visit Fairhope help my Mom who has Parkinson's and at times I need a place to board Bailey while here. There were unfriendly on the phone, and very business-centric, not customer-centric, and certainly not dog lovers. I arrived with my 3 year old Cockapoo, immediately heard someone yelling at an employee to keep the dog behind the line??  Then a woman walked briskly up to us, said I have to take her for the \"temperament test\", took my dog before she was comfortable or acclimated, came back 5 minutes later and said \"Your dog was very frightened of our test dog. Sorry she cannot board here, we have lots of big dogs.\" So I said \"let me get this straight, you immediately (in an unfriendly way) take a young dog away from its owner, walk down the hall, open a door where a large Doberman is waiting and because she gets scared you won't take her?\" I also explained that she has boarded plenty of times and does great. I even offered the phone number of the place she boards. The woman says \"Sir, your dog failed the temperament test.\"  All I can say in summary is that NO person or place that knows ANYTHING about dogs would design THAT as it's temperament test.

Everything you have described seems off. The Dog Ranch Resort is a very dog social environment and it is suited for active social dogs. All of our dogs are out in separate groups socializing with one another and they are supervised by our ranch hands. We do not just throw dogs in a dog run or a crate. Our Temperament Test Dog is a Chocolate Lab and not a Doberman. Everyone who meets him sees how calm, easy going, and sweet he is. The way our temperament test works is we want to make sure that your dog is good with a new person, a new dog, in a new place while the parents are away. Since you will be leaving your dog in our care we want to make sure that they are okay without you. What we look for is any signs of aggression, anxiety, and overall temperament of your dog. If they show any signs of aggression then our facility can not accommodate a dog that could be potentially dangerous to the other dogs. If we see a lot of fear and anxiety we always suggest a trial day to allow your dog to get acclimated to our environment. We want to make sure your dog is as comfortable as possible prior to boarding. It is also our policy that a \"Temp Test\" be done at least 2 days prior to boarding in order to allow for a trial day if necessary. Boarding your dog in a new place is very stressful for a lot of dogs so we try to take all of the necessary precautions to make sure that they aren't too overwhelmed. Before jumping in a pool most people test the water, that is the way our temperament test is designed. Our receptionist are required to treat everyone with respect, integrity, and kindness."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4220c713b92f:0xf176d2d9f950877c"}

Having a less stressed dog who listens and knows who is in charge is going to make a world of difference in our home. In just a few hours, she was responding so different than what we have been used to for the last six months. We were at our wits end with her behaviors and in the few hours Theresa was here to help me work with her I could tell a difference in her anxiety level and her behavior. I was able to go in my kitchen without a dog under my feet, answer the door without her coming too, walk her on a loose leash without her pulling in front of me. The results were amazing. Theresa will be back in a month and we will continue to work with her everyday at home to see a dramatic difference in our sweet dog.

We saw tremendous improvements in Sophie's behavior after just the first session, and over the next month it continued to improve. Sophie has developed anxiety and we're still working on keeping her calm when neighbors walk past the apartment, but when something hasn't worked, Theresa has always had another method to try.\n\nWe chose to work with Bark Busters because they claim to use positive reinforcement and better communication rather other less pleasant methods like shock collars. Sophie is a sweet dog who has a strong bond with us and we didn't want to hit or mistreat her. Theresa shares that mindset and the Bark Busters methods really have deepened our bond with Sophie.\n\nI also really appreciated that Theresa invited me to attend the training sessions even though Sophie belongs to my sister and my sister is paying for the training (not me). But because I keep Sophie during the day while my sister is at work, Theresa knew I would be spending a lot of time with Sophie. Consistency is really important to make these techniques work, and having attended the training sessions, I can work with Sophie at home during the day, which has helped our progress.\n\nFinally, lots of people claim to love dogs, but you can tell quickly that Theresa really does care about the clients she works with. If something isn't working, she doesn't force it. She's patient and she tries to tailor what she does to the dog and family she works with.

After we decided to work together, she sent me some information to get me prepared for our first meeting.  Even though she was greeted at the door with loud barks and bared teeth, she kept her cool and within about 1 hour he was eating out of her hand.  I was impressed, but the real work was yet to come.\n\nShe walked me through several different exercises/activities to recondition his behavior and train me to set the tone for what was expected in the house and out on walks, and gave me some equipment to use while training.  While neither I nor Bodie were perfect right away, the progress was astounding.  She recapped each of the activities with me before she left, and I felt very confident in 6 or 7 of the 8, but that's ok.  Part of the package she sent me later was a detailed action plan for the first 4 weeks, including a checklist for the daily activities we are supposed to practice, and a reminder on what I was supposed to do with each one.  OK!\n\nEven now just a day or two after Theresa has started with us, this dog is the best behaved it's ever been. He used to bark in my face every time I would get dressed because he knew I was going out somewhere and there was a chance he could go on a car ride or a walk.  He also used to crowd me in the kitchen while I was making dinner or getting his food ready or his treats ready.  But one of the early things she taught me was how to hold a space in the kitchen to work when I want, and to let him in during normal times.  I decided to test that right after she left by making myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Normally when he smelled peanut butter he was *right in there* hoping to get some for himself but this time he stood patiently about six feet away, and just watched until I called him and I was finished. It was the same thing for filling his food bowls and stuffing his toys with treats. Amazing!!  I cannot tell you how much more enjoyable it is to get dressed in the morning and come downstairs and put my shoes on and have a breakfast without a dog barking in my face the whole time because he expects to go for a walk or go for a ride.  He's still there next to me happy as ever, he's just not barking!\n\nWe're still working on the \"loose leash\" walking techniques, and it seems weird to have to correct him all the time instead of letting him wander around, but he's starting to figure it out, and that means less corrections.  Honestly it's better exercise for both of us when he does it correctly because we keep a good pace. He still gets to pee and poop and enjoy the outside, but we actually get moving well enough to get some real exercise, and it's much more enjoyable and less strain my back if he's not pulling the whole time.\n\nI'm excited to see how far Bodie and I can take this training, we're both learning at the same time.  I feel like I made the right decision to hire Theresa with Bark Busters, and I look forward to showing her how much progress we've made by the next time we all get together.  Thank you for making my dog more fun to be around, and safer too.  I can't tell you how much it means, but you saw it on my face.  I WISH we had done something like this earlier.\n\nIf your dog is running your house, and/or sometimes out of your control, please do something about it - call Theresa and get some help.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1613874509997, "text": "Thank you Chris.

Theresa was extremely professional, punctual, followed CDC COVID-19 guidelines, and explained everything thoroughly, ensuring that we understood what to do during the training session and for after.

We had no clue what we were getting into. This dog jumped, barked, pulled, mouthed, and had no manners. He had high anxiety when my son went to work and you could forget approaching the car when he was in it. One night he pulled me down onto the ground, jumped on my daughter and that was a wake up call. I knew that Tressia from Bark Busters had worked with several dogs at the humane society, so desperately I gave her a call. After explaining our situation, Tressia assured me that she could help. We saw a huge difference in his behaviors after the first session. We learned that Soldier believes that he's the leader of the pack when he shouldn't be. We continue to see daily improvements using the training tips Tressia gave us. We're looking forward to the second session.

I know that you mentioned Lunita sees lots of people all the time, but a daycare situation can be a very different environment for a dog. She was clearly overwhelmed and nervous from the beginning and even with more time to adjust it was clear that she would not thrive in a group play environment. Our temperament test is designed to not only ensure that a dog does not pose a risk to the rest of the pack but it also helps us determine if this type of daycare/boarding is the best environment for your pup. Just like people, some dogs find different situations more stressful or enjoyable than others.\n\nWhen we determine that a pup might not be a good fit, we generally have a manager call to provide a thorough explanation and offer recommendations. With the additional protocols currently in place to protect our clients and staff, it sometimes it gets a little more hectic and we apologize that you did not feel assured in our assessment.\n\nI am so glad that you found a place to board Lunita! We wish you and your pack the best, and please let us know if you would be interested in continuing this conversation."}, "gmap_id": "0x88893d529c0176db:0x3436b80342c70748"}

Even though there are five vets that offer boarding within 5 miles of my house, his facility is the only one I trust.\n\nThe thing I love most about WTD, is the fact that he has someone on site 24/7.  Your dog will never be left unattended or just \u201clocked up\u201d in kennel all day.  They are always playing and socializing with a great amount of supervision during the day, and at night, they have spacious kennels and someone is always staying with them.\n\nAs far as training goes, Adam helped us tremendously.  We have a German Shepherd that was starting to become fear aggressive until Adam worked with her.  He spent hours walking us through the steps to get her back on track and left us with a plan.  It was hard work, but we did everything he said.  Now, three years later, we have the most amazing dog we could have ever hoped for.  Adam is still one of our dog's favorite people in the world, and she gets so excited every time we pull in his parking lot she can barely stand it!\n\nOverall, We Talk Dog is an amazing, clean, organized and well looked after facility, and the training is outstanding.  I think some people want a trainer to come out and \"fix\" their dog for them, but that can't be done.

We called about enrolling our rescue dog in daycare and getting some training to help integrate her into the world. Our message was taken and they never called back. so I figured I would just take her down there and have a talk with these folks. I grabbed her vet papers. I had the day off so I threw on my t-shirt and flip flops since it was a hot summer day and upon arrival we were greeted by poo on the floor of the foyer and were looked up and down by the woman standing there who promptly frowned. She talked with the peson in front of me for a bit longer while studying us with that same frown on her face and after they finished their conversation asked \"May I help you?\". So a little back story on this dog. She is a boston terrier who we are fostering for a local rescue. She came from a puppy mill situation and she has a scar on one eye and at the point of writing this is still pretty malnourished. She is not the prettiest dog in the world but she is sweet and everyone who knows her loves her, Except this person apparently. SO, I told her what we were interested in and the best she would offer up was a piece of paper to sign up that she never actually gave me. She then launched into the fact that we would have to schedule a temperament assessment and that the next available appointment was several weeks out. I told her we had called several weeks ago and no-one called us back. She said that she had seen my message and that their trainers were \"Very busy\" and that they simply could not afford the time to contact me. I explained to her the situation with this dog being a rescue and that being a foster home we were not likely to have her too very long to which she simply stuff the paper back in the manilla envelope from which it came and gave me that tilted head, high pitched, insincere, \"Sorry\". So we left. Precious, our rescue dog, seemed to be a little down about it so I went by our local bagel shop who makes dog treats and picked us both up a little something for the rejection. All in all though, after thinking about it, I would not take any of my dogs to this place. Between the poo on the floor, the bad attitude, and the inability to return a phone call I don't know that I would trust these folks with my family. We had hoped to get this poor little dog some extra socialization and training to help her get along with her permanent home. I guess the search continues. I may send my spouse by in work garb with one of our fluffier dogs to see how she is treated just as an experiment.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d529c0176db:0x3436b80342c70748"}

We have never had any problems up to this point and all groomings have been on point. I knew when we walked in and saw that our normal groomer, Jonathan, was not in that it might be a tad different groom but I did not expect what we got. We asked for our doodle to be cut to about 1/2 inch without sacrificing his curls. Everytime Johnathon would cut him he would always take time to walk him back gently and today our doodle was roughly pulled to the back, and when we picked him up he was shaved down with no curls in sight. I called to express my frustration and try to process a remedy to the problem and the receptionist was extremely defensive, condenscing, and rude. As if we were the problem. Just FYI, Johnathon has moved to start his own pet salon in ATL so they will not be providing the same services if you have been a previous customer.

Our COVID Care protocols have definitely made it much more difficult for our staff to interact with our clients with conversations.  We have really missed these interactions too!  We do feel strongly that our curbside dropoff/pickup services as well as our staff wearing full PPE is in the best interest of our community, our clients, and our staff - but it has definitely left us missing those close interactions and relationship building with our clients.  I'm sorry you missed that too.  We are definitely learning how to best create relationships with our clients in the climate of COVID safety.  Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to grow and change with these new and ever changing restrictions.\n\nI'm also sorry to hear your pup got cough while he was participating in our services.  This particular strain of cough this year has actually made several national news stories as it has shown up all over the country.  It's been a nasty strain.  We worked very closely with our veterinary advisory team to be sure we were utilizing the absolute best practices in cleanliness and disinfectant protocols throughout our facility.  We also did our best to inform all clients honestly and openly about the outbreak.  We feel very fortunate that we were able to get it under control so quickly because of our amazing veterinary advisory team.  Just like childcare, dog daycare does pose a slightly higher risk of dogs getting upper respiratory infections and sometimes GI upset in group play.  We do our very best to inform our clients of this by having it clearly stated in several places on our General Client Agreement all clients receive and sign before their first day of daycare with us.  While we sincerely wish the bordatella vaccine required by our facility was able to protect against all cough, just like the human flu vaccine, it does not.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your feedback and wish you and your dog well and that you are able to find another facility that suits your needs.  Please let us know if we can help you with any pet care needs in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923bd8bf81a99:0xf88dcba01a8213d"}

However, I found the classes to be ridiculously unprofessional. They charge the going rate, $20 per 1 hour class session for 4 sessions. However, the classes never start on time, the instructor is rarely prepared with her materials, generally she is looking at her phone several times per lesson and disappearing into another room, and 2 of 4 classes ended early. The instructor clearly knows how to train a dog, however this place has a business model based on you dropping your dog off for several weeks and a thousand or more dollars later they train the dog for you. I have no doubt she is exceptionally effective in that environment, but these classes where you learn to train your dog yourself are over complicated, incoherent, and lack any kind of structure. I feel like mostly they are used to get you to admit you need to drop your dog off with them, because that is the only way the dog will get trained. I've had better experiences with a big box store training, and that isn't saying much. There are significantly better training places for the same money with a whole lot less agenda. Hint: look for a non-profit dog obedience and training club.<P>\n\nResponse to the owner:\nFirst off, it's labelled a rolling class. You don't need to offer \"a missed class at no extra charge\", that's part of it being rolling. You show up for 4 classes, whether they are consecutive or not, and I checked ahead of time to make sure that was the case. Second, in 3 of the 4 classes there was no socialization time unless you count the period of time we all waited in the office while the instructor was running late. Ending the class early twice ensured no socialization time. You offer 14 days of board and train for $1100 and 28 days for $2100. Both of those cost more than the thousand dollars I put in my review. So yes, you offer both cheaper and more expensive options, personally I think I hit the middle pretty well with my review. I put in my review you charge the going rate. I don't dispute that. I also said the trainer knows how to train dogs, the trainer simply didn't do much to help people learn to train their own dogs in this one class. Finally, the Birmingham Obedience and Training club is a non-profit club, they just aren't a charity.

I am the owner of Roverchase and you have not contacted us in your 4 week training so, until this review, I was unaware of your unhappiness.  I have called the other puppies in your class period and they have all been exceptionally pleased and have all signed up for additional group classes for continuing education, so I am a bit confused.  I would be more than happy to talk with you about your experience.  I do know that your dog missed a week of Puppy Kindergarten and we were very happy to accommodate your schedule and allow you to makeup your missed class at no additional charge.     Puppy Kindergarten is a socialization and basic manners class and not a true \"training skills\" course.  This is very clear in the description of our class on our website as well as the materials given in each class period.  As mentioned previously, I would be more than happy to speak with you about your experience, please feel free to call the front office at 205-332-0203 and ask for Abigail.  Also, as a note, our day-training program is our most popular program but it is hardly \"thousands of dollars.\"  Most of our clients spend between $250-450 for four weeks of all day training where they drop their dog of several times a week each week.  This is hardly \"thousands of dollars\" and is, in fact, some of the best prices is town.  Our Puppy Kindergarten class is also priced competitively with \"the big box store\" but you are taking this class from one of the most highly experienced and certified canine behavioral consultants in the city.  As an additional note, our prices are less expensive then the Obedience Club in our town, which is not non-profit.

Aidan did a great job and took time to work on things that I specifically was having trouble with when there was not a big class. I took my dog to daycare and the owner, Abigail, stated that he was having trouble and recommended a behaviorist that comes to Roverchase every Thursday and Saturday. The price was $400 dollars which I was happy to pay because I really wanted the best for Blue (my dog). We talked with the behaviorist for about an hour and that was the end of the session. The behaviorist did not really teach or show me anything that I did not already know. The behaviorist did not even see the behavior that I was having trouble with but yet she was quick to write out a treatment plan. The behaviorist did say that I would need to do private lessons with Abigail which is not included in the cost. So for $400 dollars I talked to a lady for an hour. This is a big scam and I am really troubled that Roverchase would be a part of it.\n\nMy appointment lasted 1 hour. We left right after 5 and the appointment started at 4. So go back and check your cameras again. Yes, I was happy to pay the $400 dollars which I stated previously. But I was under the impression that I would get useful information and more than just talking to a \"Behaviorist\" for an hour. Again, how can she, the behaviorist, tell me what is the cause and real problem without even seeing the behavior. I even emailed the behaviorist trying to get a refund because that was not what I was expecting. Not even wanting a full refund because I understand that she did take time out of her day to meet with me. But I think she can keep the $80 dollars deposit and refund the $320 since I do not need her \"expertise\" any longer. But she has not responded to my email which she specifically stated was the best/fastest way to communicate with her. And as far as reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith...I did that. You decided to lie on your response by saying that you checked the cameras and that I was there for a little under 2 hours. Your cameras times are off or you lied. I told you that I actually loved Roverchase. I even recommended people go to y'all which only one of them did but one is better than none. But I do still think that I was scammed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1525838804535, "text": "Dear Mr. Auer,\nI\u2019m so surprised to read your review regarding your experience with Blue and Dr. Beihunko, Roverchase, and the chain of events you described.  I appreciate you giving me the opportunity on this public platform to respond.\nFirstly, I\u2019m so glad you were pleased with your group classes at Roverchase with our trainer Aidan.  He\u2019s so talented and our clients just adore him.  I\u2019ll be sure to pass on your praise.  Thank you.\nTo address your concerns regarding your experience with Dr. Biehunko, I will do my best to address them in an organized fashion.\n-  I recommended Blue see Dr. Biehunko when Blue presented to daycare last week after a 5 month absence from Roverchase.  Prior to Blue\u2019s absence, we had discussed at length Blue\u2019s increase reactivity and dog related aggression and you indicated you did not want to address it with us at that time but wanted to work with it on your own.  We advised against it.  When you presented last week, Blue came for a day of daycare and was significantly worse in all behaviors.  I recommended a consultation with Alabama\u2019s only Veterinary Behaviorist, Dr. Biehunko.  I thoroughly explained how Dr. Beihunko\u2019s consultations worked, that they were $400 and for that price you received a 1.5-2hr consultation with her expertise and she would make a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and then have 6 months of medical management and follow up.  I was very clear with you that there was no doubt that Blue would need additional lessons with me and that it would be at additional cost.  You remarked that you felt this price was fair for her experience and expertise and made your appointment for later in the week\n- I do rounds with Dr. Biehunko each day for our shared clients.  She had already been thoroughly briefed on Blue\u2019s behavior at Roverchase the day he returned as well as my notes from his behavior in December when we last saw him.\n- Your consultation with Dr. Biehunko was just barely under 2hrs.  I checked the time stamp on our cameras\n- In your consultation with Dr. Biehunko we were all very surprised to hear that you insisted that Blue has received no training outside of his training at Roverchase.  In fact, you insisted this was true even when specifically questioned about this by Dr. Biehunko and the Roverchase trainers who sat in on the session with you.  As I\u2019m sure you know, it\u2019s extremely difficult for any doctor to communicate effectively and efficiently with a client when that client willfully withholds pertinent information from that doctor that impedes the treatment plan.  As you can see from the attached screen shots, not only has Blue been in training with another trainer, but it was for the very issue he was presenting for.\n- Finally, since your consultation was just over 72 hours ago, and we are very clear that treatment plans can take 2-4 weeks to become effective, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can already be so unhappy with your results.\nI certainly believe that pet owners are allowed to train and handle their pets as they see fit and that there are many fits available for many different preferences.  However, I hope we can both agree that reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith and this one has some glaring issues.  I hope, in light of this, and in light of you many months of happiness with Roverchase, you will consider removing it.  We certainly wish you and Blue only the very best and much success in all of your endeavors.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAbigail Witthauer\nRoverchase\n\nEDIT::  attachment will not post.\nDescription of photo attachment:  Blue the dog on a trainers business page looking at the screen wl a clearly visible electronic training collar, caption from the trainer, \u201cBlue the Australian Cattle Dog rocked his first lesson.

I took my Australian Shepherd here because they said they would help her with her people aggression issues. All they did was put her on medication that literally made her go crazy and she was even worse on the meds than off. And they told me to lock my dog in a room and never let her around anybody. That her best hope was for her to learn to wear a muzzle, that she would ever be able to be around people. When I tried to call for an appointment I never got a call back from them and I called and called for 3 weeks. It's been well over 2 months now and still haven't heard from them. Took my dog to Dale at Just Happy Hounds in Birmingham and she is a new dog. Completely off meds she never needed to be on and her aggression is under control. She absolutely loves 3 of the workers there and runs up to them to be petted. All I needed was someone to actually tell me what to do to help my dog. Not someone that just stuck her on meds so she would be too doped up to do anything. I have heard absolutely awful things about the people that work there from past owners that brought their dogs there. Please don't take your dogs there.

Kona has been home now for about six weeks and we are definitely experiencing a total change.
