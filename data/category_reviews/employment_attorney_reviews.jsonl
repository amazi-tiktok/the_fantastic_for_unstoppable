He refuses to return phone calls. He called me ONE TIME during my divorce, the day before the hearing. He never even bothered to send me the final divorce decree. I had no idea what my divorce papers said until his secretary emailed them to me, after the THIRD request. I know all of his secretaries because they are the only ones I could ever talk to. Half the time, they didn't return phone calls either. Halfway through the 'mediation' I got the distinct feeling that he was working for the other side. He obviously thinks he can make a living by gaining clients, screwing them over, and going on to the next victim. He must be too young and immature to grasp the concept that most people will need an attorney more than ONCE in their lifetime, and if he thinks he can be successful without the benefit of repeat clients, he is delusional. If he was the last attorney on earth, I would never hire him again. My divorce is final; I'm still missing half my belongings; he's promised me a refund twice and never delivered. On top of that, he suggested we file a contempt motion because of the fact that I was not given all the belongings I was entitled to. He didn't mention at the time that he planned on charging me an additional $1500 to do what I'd already paid him to do. In my opinion, the reason all his pictures on FB look like gangster photos is because he is a crook. He will stand there and 'listen' to you, but he is just pretending to hear you. You'd have more luck talking to a brick wall. Plus the brick wall might return your calls. I read a bad review of his, and I should have heeded it.

Hope you or a loved one is never hurt but if you have to sue an insurance company, this is your guy in Alabama. Tyler used to work as an insurance adjuster (i believe thats the official title) which means his paperwork is always the way the insurance company wants it when it is submitted. Therefore his claims will prob be put on top of the stack compared to other attorneys. It was in my case. Me personally, i was hurt in a car accident on I-65 and was worried i couldnt pay the medical bills. After having 2 sprained ankles and other various injuries(none too serious, thankfully) i ended up in a financial bind and needed the case settled quickly. He had my case settled and doubled the money i received in my hand in just 3 weeks compared to when i broke my back with another injury attorney that took over 2 years. Not only does he do a great job, he seems to genuinely be a good person and will help you all he can (his secretary, too!). Lastly, Tyler doesnt seem worried at all about taking your case to trial if he needs to. This attorney will not just try to settle your case and then pass you off to other attorneys if your case isnt an easy \"cut and dry\" claim which is VERY common in personal injury cases. I personally believe he will do a better job than ANY other injury lawyer for you because he did just that for me and he is still helping my father who was in the wreck with me but hurt worse.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b5a58dee519:0x4218ed631d7b5121"}

I needed an lawyer back in November 2010 after I was involved in a car accident on my job. I found THIRY & CADDELL, LLP on the internet on a Saturday night.  They actually reach out to me that Sunday morning. I had a face to face meeting with Mr. Richard Thiry the following Monday. Mr. Richard went above and beyond my expectations. He was very passionate about his clients and it shows in his work and spirit. The legal process was easy and stress free, I was very informed throughout the whole process by Mr. Richard and his team, and I felt at ease asking any questions I had. Richard Thiry was very diligent and got me a settlement quickly. Fast forwarding on June 14,2018 I was again involved in another car accident on the job after only been employed 2 days. I immediately reach out to THIRY & CADDELL, LLP. Mr. Richard no longer practice law because he had retired but his daughter Renee Thiry also is a lawyer there.  First, I'd like to say THANK YOU to Renee Thiry and the staff. They are very professional, personable and very helpful team.  Renee always keeps her word and came through for me when I needed her most. I hired Renee for my workers comp and personal injury suit.  Renee always made me feel that she had things under control and was on top of the case. My job terminate me after 7 months because of permeant injury due to the car accident. She help me get my unemployment to help me out until my case was settle. As a single mom with two kids it help out A LOT. My workers comp case has now been settled and i am so relieved and will be forever grateful. I know that she is also going to do a great job with my personal injury case as well. I honestly don't know what I would do without them. If you want the best then you definitely want to hire Renee Thiry.  I cannot thank her enough for all she is doing for me. I don't believe any lawyer could have done any better, that's why I truly believe they are the Best!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e0ca3cc162f:0x4a8dd40058aae01e"}
