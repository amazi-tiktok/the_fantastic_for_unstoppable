I felt very much at home as I browsed through their collection of healing crystals, ritual candles & incense, inspirational/motivational art, spiritual & meditation tools, and all sorts of unique trinkets and decorations. The store is filled with interesting products from across the world. There is something here for everyone! The owners even showed me a few of their prized personal possessions which were kept in the back room, making me feel like V.I.P.  The store itself was well kept...which I can only imagine to be a constant struggle considering how many shelves and items must be dusted frequently to maintain the clean environment. Everything sparkles! If you have the chance, ask the owner about the musical vibrations produced by the bronze gong hanging behind the register -- it makes beautiful sounds which fill the space entirely, engulfing it's visitors in a sense of peace and tranquility. This store is just the kind of retail attraction our community needs in this area - Definitely recommend visiting A Coastal Zen as soon as possible!!! Bring more money than you think you will need because you will be surprised how many items will strike your fancy!

There were so many jelly fish in the water where we were supposed to get the banana boat they called in advance and said we could still go if we wouldn't mind coming to the marina in Orange Beach to catch the boat.  No problem!  Everyone at the check in point was very friendly and very helpful.  The water was rough that day but it was just a couple days before Hurricane Sally.  Our captain did his best to make it as smooth as possible for us.  Our crewman was amazing.  He handled the rough water very well and managed to get us our life jackets, our harnesses, help us get ready to fly and also took a ton of pictures!  He deserved a large tip for sure!  We were shocked at all he was doing!  We had 8 of us from 9 years old to 67 and we all loved it.  They were very knowledgeable and we felt comfortable with them the entire time.  We all want to do it again someday!  Hopefully the weather and the water will cooperate next time and we will get the banana boat ride too.
