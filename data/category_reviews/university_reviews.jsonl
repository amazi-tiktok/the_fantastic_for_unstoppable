All animals are part of someone\u2019\u2019s family. Those animals would have been taken to shelters, no kill shelters, etc, so that they can find homes and not be tortured to death. Wake up people.

After our second drive from Atlanta Snoopy was finally diagnosed by her and her team. (After trying to get the same results for 11 months from his hospital in Atlanta he's been a patient of for 10 plus years. ) Dr. Mendoza was our first Doctor that helped take care of my baby when he had to stay a few nights to Catlin who on Ranks Supreme. Everyone that knows me knows how much I Love My Baby Snoopy and how I hate to leaving him in the hospital, but Catlin calms my soul. She called everyday for a week sometimes twice a day to give me an update on Snoopy. She  always made me feel at ease after every conversation. Snoopy was discharged over a week ago and she still called after his discharge almost everyday checking on my baby and offering me solutions. Unfortunately Snoopy is back but with the help form Catlin and Dr. Martin I think this time around the procedure they have suggested for Snoopy will get him on the road to Recovery. I've yet to meet Catlin but I hear that today September 13th is her birthday. Have a great one and I hope you will stop in to check on Snoopy. I hope the new person Morgan stepping in to fill your shoes will carry the same torch you did!\n\nPS Morgan will as soon I submitted this post.

My Miniature Pinscher was misdiagnosed by Dr. Vigg which caused her a major relapse and a 1 week stay at Auburn University Small Animal Hospital.\n\nMy Min Pin has a neurological condition and was under the care of the Neuro Team from UGA. 3 weeks before she was seen by Dr. Vigg, she was on the lowest dose of Predinisolone and being weaned off. I had travel to work a project in Maryland and my Aunt was watching her. My fur baby was not eating and drinking and showed signs of neck pain. She was taken to TU Vet school and Dr. Vigg was made aware of her MUE condition.\n\n1 week later, Mahogany could no longer walk and had to be rushed to the ER. The Neuro at Auburn University called me and inquired about her visit with Dr. Vigg and after talking with my Aunt about her med management, it was discovered he made my Aunt take her off the meds and this was why she had the severe relapse . He advised my Aunt to take her off the prescribed Prednisolone by her Neurologist, stating it was making her sick and to keep her crated for 90 days.\n\nMahogany's meds tripled and her re-checks which were every 3 months changed to monthly.\n\nI could not get TU to call me back and had to almost harrass them before I was able to speak with Dr. Bellamy who refused to address any wrong doing and stated, \"what do you want me to do about it! She's a dog!\" Dr. Bellamy was unprofessional and I questioned why she wanted to be a Vet. If these animals are only \"animals\" to her and not a life worth protecting, why is she in the field to care for them?\n\nDr. Bellamy nor Dr. David McKenize have replied to emails, although they promised they would.\n\nPlease make sure you think throughly before taking your pet to this Hospital. I know mistakes happen, however; as a Medical entity, there is a duty to make sure you are licensed to practice in a specialty and Dr. Vigg was not. Dr. Bellamy told me he did not have to be but that is not true and the Neurologists at Auburn and UGA confirmed this. They said you NEVER pull a canine off a steroid suddenly as their system will go into shock and if he were a Neuro, he would know this.\n\nA lot of progress was made to get Mahogany back on track and Dr. Vigg's negligence caused the Neuros to go back to the drawing board which upset them. They told me he never should have treated her for a Neuro condition as he is not a licensed Neurologist.\n\nPlease think twice before coming to Tuskegee University Vet Hospital. Auburn is far more rounded and the professionalism/bed-side manner exercised along with certified Medical Professionals who treat your pet with care is reasonating. It gives you peace of mind to know your pet will be given the utmost care. TU, on the other hand, views them as 4-legged property with no regard to the level of care amd treatment they are given.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c510e303e62e9:0xf598f4353e4e7ffe"}

Not to mention that my degree has opened many professional doors for me.  Now on the other hand...I do have a massive amount of student loans.  I will take responsibility because these are for profit schools.  It does not make it right.  But we as students should research these things before enrolling.

As far as classes, they were great and I had some great instructors, especially Mary Rockett and Morris Etheridge. But when it comes to the finance office you better pray because my experience has been that the majority of the people that were working in there when I attended were graduates of VC that couldn't get jobs in their field.

This of course was my BIG MISTAKE! I requested the info early on a Saturday morning not expecting to hear from them until Monday, however I was surprised when I received a call at 9 a.m. (sidenote: I didn't answer or call back because the caller did not leave a message). Upon checking my email on Saturday evening I saw a message from one of their \"Admissions Specialist\" asking me to give her a call to set up a meeting. That seemed legitimate enough so I decided to wait until Monday morning to call. My mom, who seemed very apprehensive of my decision to check out the school, suggested that I do a little more research on them and their accreditation status. I have to admit I took them at their word or rather their posting on their site stating that they were in fact accredited when considering them. After talking to my mom I thought it couldn't hurt to look up reviews on them and OH HOW GLAD I AM THAT I DID! I've read countless reviews from students and faculty warning to stay far away from this scam of a school. The most notable are those who state how desperate VC is to sign you up and once they have they rush to start billing you for things without your knowledge. Anyways on Monday I began receiving phone calls from the same number as on Saturday, mind you this isn't the number in the email sent from the admissions specialist. I received a total of 4 phone calls from this number never with a voicemail, 2 phone calls from the admissions specialists number 1 of which had a voicemail attached but get this, the second phone call from the admission specialist's number came at 6:23 p.m. after I'd received an email at 3:11 p.m. What admissions office is still open and making calls that late?!?! Today is Tuesday and after not receiving any calls around 9 a.m. I thought they'd gotten the hint that I was no longer interested, WRONG! They decided to start hounding me with another round of calls at 12:38, 2, and finishing off at 7:08 p.m. after I'd already responded to yet another one of their \"We're trying to reach you!/Let us help you!\" emails in which I replied asking them to remove me from their mailing list. In my experience with the two accredited and well-respected universities I've attended I have NEVER had anyone from admissions nor any other office or program badger me with a barrage of calls or emails.

The people here are all extremely nice, including the cleaning staff and RAs, and things are almost always quiet. It's a suite style dorm, so you have your own room and share a common area with 2-4 roommates. A good bit of furniture is provided, but I'd recommend bringing a card table at least for the main area, as well as a coffee table, as the provided side desk isn't very good. My room had a few different problems, including smelly air conditioning, a closet that smelled literally like cat pee, and a main area light that was extremely dim (had to buy three different lights to evenly light the room). I submitted all three of these problems as work orders, and the first two were solved really quickly (the next day). The light, however, literally took two weeks to get a replacement for, and is still unusually dim. Water pressure is also routinely a problem if you're on the fifth floor. The trash chutes are never open, which means that people leave their trash in the trash rooms and it smells whenever you walk by. Other than all this, though, this is probably the best place to live while on campus. If you have a bad roommate here, it's not as much of a problem as it is having one at new freshman or even Ridgecrest East as the two sides are separated. 10/10 would stay again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602a349e87527:0x9a2ead4637f42e84"}

This review is for the Ridgecrest Village as a whole, including South, East and West.\nAll three buildings are honors only dorms (that is, only students in the honors college) with 4 bedroom suites: in South (which houses both the North and South tower), each person gets their own 9' by 11' private bedroom (twin XL bed, desk, dresser, nightstand with drawer and locking cabinet, tv jack, Ethernet, phone line) and the suite shares a 12' by 14' living room (tv stand, tv jack, Ethernet, phone jack, high table with 2 tall chairs, couch, and 2 side tables) and a kitchenette (full refrigerator, microwave, and ample counter and cabinet space) amongst the 4 total roommates. Each suite also has 2 full bathrooms, which you share with one of your roommates. Before you move in, you fill out a roommate profile on the housing match site, where you can talk with several others with similar interests/living habits/study schedules/etc., and pick who you want to live with. As you get to know your roommates (generally several months) before you move in, most people will discuss who will bring what for the room (TV, wall hangings, curtains, whatever else you may want). East and West give you a little bit more room (but with a slightly smaller kitchen and showers) and an extra storage room. East and West are also a bit quieter, but South had nicer common areas, like the atrium, game room, and media room.\nIn all 3 buildings, there are a few 2 bedroom suites, however these are very limited and full up quickly. They are also smaller, and I personally prefer the 4 bedroom.\nAll 3 buildings also have several handicap accessible rooms, with larger bedrooms, bathrooms, accessible shower, and doorbell with a bright flashing light inside. There are also 2 elevators in each tower and multiple in East and West if they are needed. There may be additional accessibility features I am not aware of at this point.\nIn South, the laundry ($1.50 per wash and $1.25 per dryer- same across campus except international student living) and community kitchens (2 full ranges, 2 ovens, fire suppression system, 2 full refrigerators, and a seating area) are on the 2nd and 4th floors. The second floor also houses the atrium (used for several larger events put on by the college, and also used for group projects and studying), game and media rooms, so these suites fill up quickly. The 5th floor rooms all have extra tall ceilings, and several have an extra foot or 2 on the living room and bedrooms as they extend outwards from the building.\nIf you bring a car/truck, (which Alabama actually allows freshman to do) and you stay in any of the Ridgecrest dorms, you will be parking it in the parking garage underneath South, but it isn't more than a 90 second walk from either of the other 2 buildings.  If you prefer, there are several other lots you can park in if your vehicle doesn't fit, but the clearance is 7'8\" with fairly large spots so most cars/trucks will fit. In all of the other dorms I can think of, you have to park elsewhere.  Ridgecrest is the only dorm village with built in parking for students (except handicap).\nMany of then off campus housing options (which almost everybody takes with the exception of RAs and athletes) are nicer and less expensive, but as far as freshman dorms, Ridgecrest is by far my favorite.\nOverall, you honestly can't go wrong with any place in the Ridgecrest village. The other suite style dorms (presidential, lakeside, riverside) are very similar, and very nice, but are for both honors and non-honors students.
