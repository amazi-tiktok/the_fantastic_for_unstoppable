I'm so sorry you were so disappointed with our boys selection to give us such a low review. We mainly market the store as a girls store but we do carry a little boys. In the past (prior to about 7 years ago) around a 1/3 of our store was boys and we carried much larger sizes. Now we only go newborn - 4T with boys and also a smaller amount than in the past. Depending on when you came to the store we may have already sold it all for the season. Every since casual/athletic clothes got popular here just isn't much boy clothes to carry any more. Most of the boutique brands that carried boys either stopped making it or went out of business. The boys boutique clothes has unfortunately died off a lot in the past 7 years. If you are looking for a specific brand or style that is getting popular let me know and I will research it!  I appreciate you visiting Whoopsie Daisy.

Ill explain it again...You placed your order on the same day 40 other people did and that was the day i listed them on facebook as a preorder. I have to turn it in on the website so those people can checkout. I had no clue that one lone person would find the website that day and check out with it. I tried explaining this process to you and i apologized that this happened. I said i see where you were coming from and im sorry. It was something that fell through the crack because i thought you were one of the facebook customers since it was the same day. You asked why i didnt call everyone and tell them. I tried to explain that we do preorders all the time on certain items our customers want us to and to message every person that checks out just to tell them that item is a preorder would just be telling them something they already know. I understand that wouldnt have been the case with you but this is the first time anyone has ever found the website and checked out on the same day i open an item for a preorder. I had no clue that would have happened. Which you kept telling me i should have known? In 5 years, that has never happened!  Again i apologized and tried to explain over and over. I told you i saw your side and it was our mess up but you didnt want to see our side and how this accident happened. YOu wanted answers i couldnt give you. we have ppl checkout all ways. Just because i can see where they checked out doesnt mean anything. My rudeness came after you were. I had said i understand your point and i was sorry and i tried to explain to  you how our systems works and how this happened but you didnt want to hear it. I did cancel the order because of the way you acted. I can assure you though that none of my customers call me rude. I go above and beyond for them!

After my daughter made a purchase with her gift card, the associate at the counter took it upon herself to take a donation from the gift card for what she says is charity.  My family and I are totally in favor of donating for a good cause as we have done so for many years.  I am however bothered that an associate would take advantage of a 10 year old. By the way, we were with her.  Once we realized what had taken place, my daughter and her mother went back to the counter to question  the associate as to why did she take it upon herself to take money from my daughter.  The response that was given was that the system took the money automatically.  To that, my response  is that either something is wrong with their system or the associate is less than honest.  If she would have just asked my daughter to donate, I am sure that she would have done so.

I literally did not see one piece of paper or similar debris on the floor. Shelves were nicely organized with price tags, clearance racks and store personel easy to find. Everyone (employees and customers alike) was wearing their masks and following social distancing guidelines which made the whole experience even more pleasant since I was shopping with several friends including my one year old great niece and a lifelong friend who has an extremely compromised  immune system from struggles with Crohn's disease. Scored a ton of bargains on name brands and designer's fashions. Seriously, I got my great niece a pair of sneakers and a pair of adorable boots for only $2 each. By the way, they were made by none other than the legendary JUICY COUTURE. I would have had to shell out another $45-$65 if I had purchased these designer's labels from elsewhere.  I felt practically criminal after swiping a game carrying case plus a glass screen protector (two separate items) for my son's NINTENDO SWITCH. I paid $5 for both which saved me about $15 and earned me HUGE POINTS with my son. How about this bit of awesomeness: $3 for Beyonce Pulse perfume, 3.4 ounce bottle, normally $15 or more. I also grabbed 2 hoodies for $1 each.

My measurements were wrong the first time, so I went back and saw the manager. She measured again and changed everything. When I received my suit for the final fitting, everything was as per the original measurements and too big. They are supposed to overnight my new suit which I'll see 3 days before my wedding.\nIn addition, my son is very small, and I asked for the smallest fit. He received a regular slim fit instead of extreme slim fit which looks baggy. I was told by the person on duty that they don't have extreme slim fit for children (my son is 11, so I'm paying full price for his rental). I don't believe this to be true and will be speaking with the manager soon. I will not recommend them to anyone else. All of my groomsmen and father of the bride are using them, and the father of the bride at a different Men's Warehouse didn't receive his shoes. I can't believe we're paying $200 / person for all of the hiccups during the preparation phase.\n\nEDIT / UPDATE - My new arrival came in a couple of days before my wedding and fit fine.  In the shuffle, the new order had a white shirt instead of ivory and I didn't realize until the day of my wedding that my shirt was ALL wrong!  Luckily Newnan in GA was able to fix me up.  My mom drove over an hour both ways to get me an ivory shirt.\nMeanwhile, I'm waiting on my custom suit.  They were supposed to make up for ALL of this with a \"special\" custom suit, and there's nothing different about the one I am receiving versus any other Joe Custom Suit.  (mind you there were 7-8 in the bridal party who all rented suits from Men's Warehouses across the Southeast who all had some sort of issue).\nI went in yesterday to pick up after my final fitting a week ago, and they had not touched it.  I was told on a Tuesday I could come get it on the weekend.  No calls, no emails, nothing.  So I go in AFTER the weekend and it had not been touched and they said, \"wait 10 minutes and we'll have it ready.\"  NO!  I don't want my custom suit rushed.  I should add that customer service reply 4 months ago gave me a nice discount on my rental, and Kyla and David mean well at this location, but they can't, and shouldn't walk behind all of their employees.\nThis is the worst experience I've ever had with any establishment in the US.

I went with my fiance and two brothers to buy them suits for the wedding, and weren't treated very well. My middle brother wears camouflage, jeans and boots all the time and obviously the employees there aren't used to seeing that and deem anyone who does wear it beneath them because there was a very rude comment made about my brother behind his back but within earshot. After our 2 hour trip there, he had to use the restroom, on his way to the restroom he passes by an employee helping a mother and her son. The employee proceeds the comment after seeing my brother \"what is that?\" And laughs with the mother and son he's currently helping. Strike one. You can tell the man helping us deems it beneath him also because he acted like it pained him to be seen with us and halfway measured them for tailoring until we told him more needed to be done to make the suits look like they should. Strike 2. They tell us at checkout that the suits will be ready in two weeks on a specific date and we could come pick them up. My fiance and I make a special trip again to come pick them up, get there and they have to search for our order and lo and behold....it's not ready. But \"don't worry. It will be ready tomorrow. You can just get it then.\" No we can't because we have to drive for 2 hours and can't just keep doing that on a whim. Not a call, email or anything informing us that the suits weren't ready. I firmly believe they had just stuffed them into the back room and forgotten about them. Strike 3. We have yet to go back to pick up the order because we haven't found the time but I'm waiting for the next mishap. So if you were to ask me, NO do not go to this location. Terrible service. Rude and think they're better.\n\nLet me add: After going the 2nd time to pick the suits up.

Better yet, I would assign a negative number if that were an option. If you do not read any further, the takeaway is this: Run don't walk to Jos. A. Bank for tuxedo rentals. I have never encountered such incompetence or ignorance as I have at Men's Wearhouse.\n\nWhere shall I begin. . . If you go to Men's Wearhouse you will be lectured ad nauseum about the importance of everyone in your wedding party providing the group number at the fitting. Great in theory. In reality, we were given the incorrect group number. Thankfully, one of the groomsmen caught the error and provided us the correct number. Yes, let that sink in. No one at Men's Wearhouse was competent enough to provide the number. Don't stress the importance of something and then screw it up. We were, of course, offered no explanation as to why we were given the incorrect number.\n\nMoving on to the next issue. I had a coupon from a bridal magazine that I provided during our initial visit. This coupon was to be applied to each tuxedo rental (14 total). Do you think it was applied? Of course not. It came to our attention when several groomsmen commented on the cost of the tuxedo rentals. Of course, there was no explanation for why the coupon was not applied.\n\nAt this point, it is Thursday morning and we are getting married on Saturday. Have they called to tell my fiancee that his tuxedo is ready? Of course not.\n\nAnd, here's the best part of the story, every time I have called to point out some screw up, the phone is answered \"Hi. This is _____. How can I provide you with world class service today?\" Well, start with doing your job and being competent. But that isn't going to happen. Go to Jos. A. Bank and save yourself the headaches.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7e4bf:0xbdcc0942cf20358e"}

Where do I begin?\n\nI'd give zero stars for this particular location, but 1. you can't give 0 stars on Google Reviews, and 2. we did actually have a good experience renting our wedding tuxes with one of the managers Homer (who is the only competent employee here, so I give a star to Homer. And well, we didn't actually pick up the wedding tuxes at this location, just placed the order, but I'm pretty sure if we did get them from here something would've gone wrong.) but everything else we have tried to do at this store was a complete fail.\n\nMy husband ordered a couple suits and two pairs of pants to get alterations done. They completely wonked up the alterations and made the suit look like a baggy potato sack. We actually did extensive research on how men's suits should fit and the finished product didn't turn out to look anything like the books.\n\nNot only were the alterations terrible but they weren't completed on time. Something about the pants not being shipped on time, but they were smart on their part and gave us a phone call to tell us it wasn't ready when they said it would be.\n\nAfter the messed up all the alterations my husband went back for a second fitting to have them fix the problem. The first suit was completed in a timely manner and turned out exactly how he wanted it to be. They told him to come back the next Saturday and the other suit and two pairs of pants would be done by then.\n\nThis is where things get screwy. The second suit's alterations were completely off, and it seemed like no one had touched them. Pair of pants #1 were even longer and baggier than the pants on the suit, like they definitely were not touched or tailored whatsoever. They were too long by a good 4-5 inches and too baggy in the waist. ON TOP OF ALL THIS PAIR OF PANTS #2 WAS NOT DONE AND NO ONE HAD CALLED OR INFORMED US THEY WERE NOT READY. They said the tailor had left for the day. SO WE HAD DRIVEN AN HOUR TO GO TO THIS STORE TO PICK UP NOTHING BECAUSE ALL THE ALTERATIONS WERE WRONG AND THE ORDER WASN'T EVEN COMPLETED.\n\nIt is very very very clear that some managers in here are not doing their jobs correctly. I came here on a Saturday night - the store was a mess. There were ties and handkerchiefs not hung up, hangers not spaced evenly apart, the phone was ringing of the hook and no one was picking it up, and all the employees were either watching TV and I believe the manager was outside on his cell phone. It is clear that the tailors, or at least one of them doesn't have a brain and is completely incompetent. I understand that these people are most likely overworked or underpaid but it is such a disappointment to receive poor customer service in our economy because there are plenty of people who are more intelligent and harder working that can't find jobs because schmucks like the people at Men's Wearhouse are getting paid to watch TV, talk on their cell phones, and leave work before getting their jobs done.\n\nThis store is a joke and it is pathetic.
