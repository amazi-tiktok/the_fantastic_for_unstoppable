My grandmothers home burned down to the ground Thursday (August 29th, 2019) I called the doctors office that day and wasn\u2019t able to get a hold of anyone. I had a lot going on that day since her home burned down that morning around 4am. This includes me driving from Atlanta to Citronelle,Al! After a few hours of trying to figure out what to do I drove my grandmother back with me to Atlanta. Since they did not answer Thursday my plan was to call Friday! I called Friday and spoke to a nurse and informed her about my grandmothers home and her losing EVERYTHING! I wasn\u2019t sure what medications she was taking and my grandmothers memory isn\u2019t well! So I told her to prescribe her everything because it needed to be replaced. I also had questions about putting my grandmother on the patch and some other things. She said she would ask the doctor and call me back. The main item we needed was her BREATHING MACHINE!!! Well surprisingly nothing was done Friday! I called again Saturday and spoke to a young lady named Jennifer (on call nurse) explained everything again and what I needed. Jennifer did get a few medicines prescribed but the breathing machine issue was never resolved! I ALSO HAD TO CORRECT THE NUMBER the nurse before her added CVS number as the contact number.\n\nSo I had to call back Monday which was a holiday. I spoke to Sheena who was very helpful and called me back with every update! Nothing could be done since it was a holiday!\n\nSo today is Tuesday and I call the doctors office again to get a BREATHING MACHINE for my grandmother, Leslie answered the phone and basically told me it was my fault because they have been trying to call and there was no answer (no one called my phone) she also told me they don\u2019t send prescriptions for breathing machines out of state!

He came in and was scheduled for exploratory surgery to fix SHODDY WORK DONE BY DR CHANDLER during a sinus polyp surgery and my step son began to pour blood from his Sphenopalatine Artery and the office was more worried about getting another three hundred dollar copay out of us than helping my son.

They had to take my son by ambulance over the the hospital and then the nightmare continued.  The ER doctor threw my son out of the hospital room that he was scheduled to be in.

MY WIFE HAD TO ENLIST THE HELP OF THE AMBULANCE DRIVERS Who could see that our son was in agony and practically DEAD AT THEIR HANDS!

They are rude, inattentive, and dismissive.\n\nThey have lost a KEY part of my chart.

Without this vital piece of my medical documentation, I must start from scratch here and do ANOTHER sleep study, complete with $750+ copay plus specialist office visit copays, in order to make sure I have a working CPAP and all the paraphernalia that goes with it. This pivotal piece of my MEDICAL CHART is gone. Completely unacceptable.\n\nI had my sleep study completed in 2017. I moved to another state at the end of that year.

This means that I have to undergo ANOTHER sleep study here, which is now dangerous, what with COVID-19, not to mention expensive and incredibly inconvenient from where I live now.\n\nOn my first visit to this practice, I received a letter informing me to be at their office at least 30 minutes before my scheduled appointment time. Myself and one elderly lady were at the door at the appointed time. Locked, and no one answered. After waiting in the chill morning on the stoop for about 25 minutes, we were let in and given forms. The receptionist, and older lady, stepped away from the desk. Other lady and I finished our forms and then waited for her to come back. And waited. And waited. After about 20 minutes of this, she laughingly came back to the desk with no apology and said she'd been having a cup of coffee and chatting with someone in the break room. The other patient and I exchanged incredulous words when we sat down to wait more.\n\nThe nurse was curt and huffy each time I went. On one occasion, she forgot to mention to the doc that I was in an exam room - I waited for about 50 minutes before I started roaming the halls, looking for her. I saw her in her office on the phone, and her eyebrows rose when she saw me and she apologized profusely when she did enter the room. The doc was great - the staff was just awful.\n\nI'd go elsewhere for my care if I still lived in Huntsville.

However as time continued to go on witch was a mistake on my part, I should have paid attention to the red flags and dissolved the doctor~ patient relationship. He is Not attentive, He spent no time in any of our appointments 2-5 minutes at the most, literally! He did not listen to my concerns seemed to brush them off as nothing, He was more concerned about getting to the next patient & his nurse was just as rude. I had already made up in my mind that when I went in to discuss my chest/lung scan on 7/28/20 this would be my last visit with him. His nurse asked how I had been doing. I explain horrible since my last appointment with him witch was in March. I have lupus and we all know this horrible disease can attack your organs. I was in his office in March complaining of the very same things I always have since day one of being referred to him. Well in April at the beginning my symptoms had began to get worse, come to find out I had bacterial pneumonia, bc this doctor doesn\u2019t take the time a patient deserves he did not discover this bc he doesn\u2019t do anything than the bare minimum. Took me two months to recover from. As time goes on I simply can not breathe doing any kind of task. Showering, brushing my teeth, going up and down my stairs in our home, cleaning, sleeping, laying flat or sitting up. My breathing is very difficult & labored and my other doctors have noticed & tried yo address accordingly. Being that he is my pulmonologist I\u2019m advised to contact his office. I do and it takes an unacceptable amount of time to get anything addressed, however his nurse told me on my last visit before she went to get him, she hushed me with a finger ad if I was a child & told me stop talking and save my breath so I could tell him my complaints. I explained to her that my ability to breathe was becoming more difficult even in simply conversation so I\u2019m assuming this sarcastic gesture & remark was stemmed from me expressing that. I told her that he never takes the time to listen and address my concerns and spends no time with me so I can, obviously she told him that like she said she would and when he came into the room it was obvious by his demeanor he may have been bothered by what I expressed. This man has continued to speak with me about acid reflux continuously, he is my pulmonary doctor not my GI doctor so let\u2019s discuss my pulmonary issues not my GI issues that you say is the cause of everything witch I politely disagree. I\u2019m 41 not 4, I know my body I know what going on and he would to if he took the time to listen. He was very rude as I sat there crying simply trying to express my concerns my fears of what I\u2019ve been complaining about since day one. He was intimidating, rude, starting loud talking me after I asked him not to, dismissed my report from my ct scan dismissed the ongoing issues of my breathing getting worse, ask did I trust him and after receiving my answer is when the very inappropriate behaviors as a doctor began. This is not acceptable to me and if it was the patient acting in these ways 911 probably would have been called, he \u201c fired \u201c me as a patient he got up left the room as if he was coming back. I sat there crying, frustrated, humiliated, saddened after sitting in my car for over an hour bc he was late to receive this kind of treatment and was in the physical office all of 3-5 minutes for this? I got up to walk out he seen me looked at me in discuss and was walking into the room of another patient but, gave me the impression he\u2019d be back in my patient room. I walked out... I pay way to much money is my co-pays my husband works way to hard to provide so we can have access to good insurance and benefits especially in my condition with lupus that has been a roller coaster ride of everything.
