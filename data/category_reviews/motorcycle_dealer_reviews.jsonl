Ask lady behind the counter why the price difference and she couldn't give a straight answer then proceeded to say that the OWNER wrote a 6 instead of 9 and they were $995.00 not $695.00 as written on the tags of the others.  Then the gentleman that was behind the counter came out on the showroom floor and says \"OH NO I CANT SELL THEM FOR THAT AND I CANT EVEN BUY THEM FOR THAT PRICE and proceeded to snatch the price tags off the ones that had a tag marked $695.00 on them in front of us.    Ask if he would sell for the price that was on it prior to him snatching the price tag off and he RUDELY said NO.  I am a small business owner myself, and would never have done this to a customer, especially pulling off price tags in front of a customer and telling them I can't honor the price tag that is on the item because of a mistake that was made by the owner of the busiess.  Honor the price that is on the tag and then correct the price issue after the customer has left the busines.\nSo buyer beware of this place of business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624729985517, "text": "I'm sorry you feel the need to try to hurt our business due to a small error.

Joe was EXTREMELY gracious, knowledgeable, friendly and laid back - he's just like a longtime friend that you haven't seen in awhile!  We decided on a white Wolf, full face helmet and alarm system.  The purchase process was very smooth and easy.  Joe answered all our questions and concerns and assured us that delivery could be expected in a few days.  Sure enough, 4 days later we returned to pick up the Wolf - it was all prepared and ready to go - just as Joe assured us it would be.  My grandson was so excited!  After break-in, we returned the Wolf to Joe for fluid changes and adjustments and again had a most pleasurable experience; the maintenance took only a few minutes; Joe even provided my grandson with several shaded sun shields.

This ATV has no trouble pulling the 950 pound trail mower we use on the farm or putting that smile on your face at the end of a hard days work . The 570 has more than enough power for the tough jobs or excitement out on the trail. The best way to describe the Polaris 570 utility edition and Champion Powersports is simple. The right tool for the job. Thank you to everyone at Champion for what you do.\nMatthew Porterfield", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b0cc039980d:0x789d8a26f66daf97"}

I had a horrible experience down the street at a large dealer who kept my Honda Rancher for two months the first time to replace the carburetor and flush the fuel tank. After I finally picked it up I took off to Ohio on a week long hunting trip only to have it ruined by a carburetor that wasn\u2019t installed properly. Matter of fact the 4 bolts that attach the carburetor were barely  finger tight causing fuel to leak into my air filter chamber. I came home and took it back for another 6 to 8 weeks and had to go sit in the waiting room to have someone actually work on my unit.   A week later after finally picking up my Rancher it wouldn\u2019t crank. A friend told me about Powersports Service Center and  Chuck and the team were amazing. My unit was fixed in three days and the real problem was found and corrected immediately. My Rancher runs perfectly now cranking with the slightest touch of the starter. Powersports Service Center will be the only people who ever  work on my equipment from now on. Oh yeah, the price was very reasonable to top it off.

The additional items and Alabama mandatory tire sales fee were the only charges the customer wasn\u2019t aware of. The customer was phoned to be informed, but didn\u2019t  answer the phone during the servicing, so that we could make him aware of the extra needed items.  When the customer arrived to pick up the unit, and was presented the repair bill, he was adamant that he wasn\u2019t going to pay for the extra items, so it was offered to remove the items and return his original equipment.  In the end the shop owner marked down the cost of the repair and the shop gave the customer a free tube to help ease the cost of the repair.

This may not be the case in this particular situation, but in many instances maintenance becomes a can of worms, and if the machine is to work properly (for which it was brought to the dealership) there are additional things to be performed.

I searched different sites across the country and there were many that offered many different conversion kits. After reading reviews from people who converted their two wheel I had decided on one type. However I kept looking for goldwing that had already been converted and would take my in trade. I came across the site KD CYCLE in Altoona just north of Birmingham Alabama.  I looked at their inventory and what conversion kit they were using.  I had not heard of the type they used. But I liked the reviews of the cycle shop. Reviews were outstanding. So I researched the conversion kit. They used  the Roadsmith conversion kit. After researching the Roadsmith conversion I was sold on it. So I called KD and talked to Kevin.  We discussed options of conversion or trading. I told KEVIN I had a 2008 with 33k mikes, he thought I should consider a conversion because of the year and low mileage. Kevin also indicated they can do the conversion in one day and would also pick up and deliver.  I loved that option. I agreed to convert  and would get back to him on timing.  About 2 weeks later I was driving back from Dallas and decided to stop by the shop. There I met Michele. I talked to her about what I was looking for and wanted. During our discussion, I looked at their available inventory.  They had amazing looking trikes. I looked at each one, sat on many and talked to her about each. My intention was to see what they did and how the conversion kit looked. I was stunned at what I saw. I had my son with me and he kept guiding me to one he liked more than I did because of the color. Michele talked about the features it had and didn\u2019t have.  One of my must haves was nav. This bike didn\u2019t have nav.  It was a no go for me.  We looked at automatic drive trikes.  We kept talking about the inventory. Michele kept answering all type of questions, we kept at her about the inventory she had. Michele was amazing. So going from just wanting to see what KD was about, I decided to trade my bike for the one my son kept pulling me to. He and Michele said I needed to come to today and use my phone like most people did.  I had to agree.  We agreed on a trade in price and bike price.  I ended up with a 2016 trike with 2800 miles on it. So basically a new bike. WOW, didn\u2019t see that coming. Kevin and Michele were amazing. The customer service they provided was second to none. You won\u2019t find better customer service in this industry anywhere. There was no hard sell or pushing me to make a purchase.  I had already decided to convert. I would recommend anyone looking to convert or purchase one already converted KD is the place. You owe it yourself to at least call and talk to them and see what inventory they have.

This was my second brand new $10,000+ Honda.  I recently purchased a $10,000+ KTM elsewhere (Not from Halls) because I could not get this dealer to work with me.\n\nFirst Red Flag, the bike had 14 miles on it at delivery.  I guess someone took it home for the night...  (They did disclose the mileage at the time of sale.)\n\nLater, I had some issues and wanted the bike looked at under warranty.  I was told they would charge me to look at it if they could not submit a warranty claim to Honda.  This is lack of basic customer service.  If you want your customers to come back you take care of them.  Take care of your customer and they will take care of you.\n\nLater still, I wanted to trade in my paid off bike that I purchased from them for a new one.  They told me if I wanted to trade in that they would \"give me a good price\" for my bike because I bought it from them and I'm buying another.  Great!!!, or so I thought...  They offered me about 80% of my motorcycles KBB Trade in Value.  80% of Trade In!!!  My bike is in like new condition, air conditioned garage kept!!\n\nSo long story short, I guess I am done with Mobile Honda.  I guess I wont rule out Halls in general...  Its kind of tough with them being the only game in town.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c55fd1ea6e1:0x29463d3329c58ec4"}

A few years later I did the same for a Kawi DLR 650. Each time my experience couldn't have been better. Everyone there was super nice and very knowledgeable.

My original review was a bit critical, due primarily to my lack of experience working with dealers when buying a new bike.   Let me elaborate:\nDealership:  Original review was that this was a typical Harley Dealership,  however after visiting a few others out of the area, I would say it is above average.  Welcoming staff with good selection of bikes and gear, an overall comfortable environment to shop.\nFinance:  They definitely did not mess around with offering a solid interest rate out of the gate.  The finance person was great, explained all the numbers and answered all my questions.  The application process was easy and overall enjoyable.\nPricing:  Spot on pricing with MSRP.  Standard doc, destination fees, however there wasn\u2019t an additional mark up on the price.\nSales:  This is where the deal fell apart. Another dealer offered to include the new riders course ($250) and deliver the bike for free ( a little over 50 miles ).  Being my local Harley dealer and a member of the same owners group,  I thought this might be standard among the three shops. It was not.   When I asked if they would do the same, the answer was \u201cno\u201d.  Asked if that was a deal breaker, I replied yes and that was the end of that until I posted my review here online.\nA different sales person contacted me and tried to make the deal, unfortunately I was still annoyed and never really gave him a chance to try to work it out.\nOverall, I have no reservations giving this dealer a 5 star review after shopping around, the majority of the process was smooth and enjoyable.  After all is said and done would I go back and try again, absolutely.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621743788893, "text": "Very sorry to hear this, Ropa.

The GM reached out to me quickly and decisively and solved my most recent problem.  I was really impressed with what he said about his commitment to making the quality of service at Heart of Dixie as great as the quality of shopping and sales.\n\nORIGINAL POST on 10/15/2015... Loved the \"bike purchase\" part--5 stars.  Bought a brand new Vrod Muscle in 2011 and a new Road Glide Ultra in 2012.  Unfortunately, like so many other businesses out there, once you buy they forget all about you.  I'm speaking specifically about service--1 star.  The quality of service is fine--4 star, but the speed of service is what kills the rating for me--1 star.  Waiting two weeks on a regular basis to get your bike back is crazy.  That's been my experience on multiple occasions.  Counting today, five times, I've discovered problems as I'm about to go out of town on a ride.  They've been completely unwilling to work me in and help out so that I could make my trips.  Today was a little different.  I tried to get through to service and left messages beginning a 4 pm and now they've closed and still no call back.  I've had much better luck on service with Rider's Harley Davidson in Trussville.  Interesting to me that both stores are owned by the same man.  I've heard it said that the easiest customer to get is the one you already have.  In this particular case, I'll have to decide if the \"joy\" of owning a Harley is worth the aggravation of getting it taken care of!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1445528061992, "text": "Hi Bob, We're very happy that we were able to get this fixed for you.

They misrepresented several things to us. We were told they have to pay Honda MSRP so their only way to make any money was to charge us a $1600 freight and bolt charge. That is simply not true. They also tried to sell us a maintenance plan saying the first maintenance required on the machine we were considering would cost $500. We discovered this maintenance was simply changing the oil and spark plugs which can easily be done by me for a material cost of $65. We had a UTV we took to get a possible trade in value on and after having their service department look at it came out with a long list of work it needed and offered us a RIDICULOUSLY low offer of $1850. We took that machine to a mechanic later and it required a tune up that cost me $150 and I sold it for $6000. Not only are they gouging people on pricing they are being dishonest while doing it.  Needless to say we did not buy anything here. Won\u2019t go back and won\u2019t recommend. Bought the machine they quoted us for $3000 less at a dealer in Mississippi. Well worth the drive to get it.

It seems it depends on the mood of the sales folks if they want to be fair or try to score on a huge markup on a sale.\n\nYou will find \u201cinternet\u201d pricing on many of their products and that price seems fair compared to other shops. The problem is when they give you the \u201cout the door\u201d price you will see they jack up the \u201cfees\u201d to more than make up for that good price.\n\nThey matched another dealer on our first purchase.

They also want you to buy the massive markup warrantee and finance at 15-25%.  They actually don\u2019t seem to want cash sales.\n\nNeedless to say I drove over to Atlanta and I\u2019ve found several dealerships much easier to deal with.

I asked even a two and one year old. He told me yes. So we left. I guess speedzone enforces a mask policy on who they see fit to.

THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN INEXPERIENCED CONSUMER!\n\nMy 20 year old son purchased a Rancher with accessories including snorkel kit with Bama Power Sports. The salesman asked the service manager if installing the snorkel kit would void the warranty, the service manager said he didn't know but not to worry about it. They would fix it if it messed up. So, it was not disclosed to him that by using the accessories he purchased it could potentially void his warranty. He was however told by the salesman, in front of two witnesses, that Bama Power Sports would warranty it for 1 year \"It doesn't matter if you set it on fire or run it into a lake, we will cover it\".  THEY SAID WHATEVER THEY THOUGHT HE WANTED TO HEAR TO MAKE THE PURCHASE.\n\nThe first time my son took his Rancher out he used the snorkel kit. It got water in it. He looked under the 4-wheeler and there was a hose unattached. Had to be a poor install since it was the first time my son took it out. Honda Warranty will not cover it, snorkel kit, makes sense. But now Bama Power Sports is denying the salesman ever said anything about a 1 year warrant to these kids. Now I know these kids do not know anything warranties so they did not make this statement up. Bama Power Sports allowed my son to leave there thinking he was completely covered and is now refusing to make things right. $1,800 repair.\n\nWe tried to negotiate some sort of deal with them to take partial responsibility but they refused to speak to our attorney or have their attorney speak to ours. We decided we didn't trust these people enough to even work on it. When we went to pick it up they brought it out in pieces on pallets. I just hope all the parts are there. We now have to take it to someone else to fix it.

They sold my wife a used rzr for 2500 more than what it would cost new and it was bone stock.(extra b.s) so after taking our Polaris to have serviced thru there speed pass.this is ruffy 1 year later cause hey I paid for why not use it. Well let's start off by saying this is the 3rd time the ploaris has been in for service.so dropped it off on a Tuesday and they tell me it will be ready on the next day. So the next day rolls around and I do not get a call to come pick it up. So the next day Thursday I call them and ask if it's ready to be picked up. They informed me yes it is ready. So let's load the trailer and go to pick it up.once getting there they hand me paper work and he goes to find my sxs. He is walking around everywhere in the shop to find this sxs. So I look at the paperwork and it is paperwork for a Honda i used to own not the Polaris so I tell him it's the ploaris not the Honda due to the Honda being in Texas now. They then go on to tell me that they just completeld the work on my Honda.so that's when I decided to let him know that it's in Texas. But yet they did the service and paperwork.once we found our ploaris we were told it would be ready the next day. So moving on to next day we get there to pick up the machine thsy has 150 hrs on it and they only do a 25 hr service on the machine. They cant tell me how many services it has had even tho they did it. So there goes our warranty  and extended warranty. Man this place is the biggest joke ever.

I called about having the electronic shift looked at on my rancher 350. The lady said we are backed up so it will be a couple weeks before I can get to it. I told her that would be fine I wasn\u2019t in a hurry that I just needed it before hunting season. She said bring it down. So I spent 20-30 minutes hooking up the trailer and loading the 4-wheeler and 45 minutes driving down there. Just to find out they will not work on my 2005 rancher. Let me be clear, I\u2019m not upset that they wouldn\u2019t service my atv. I\u2019m upset that about 3 hours of my Saturday had been wasted and could\u2019ve been avoided by simply telling me their policy over the phone. And the fact that the lady acted as though I had wasted her time. When in actually I feel as though my time was wasted. I\u2019ve bought several parts and dealt with Bama Power sports service dept before this interaction with no problems whatsoever. Not to mention Bama Power Sports seemed to be thankful for my business. I\u2019ve never left feeling as though I wasted their time. I was concerned when I saw management was changing but with all the good reviews I figured it would be the same experience as before.

Save your self some time and money go to Motorcycle sports or Talladega cycle. Speedzone is already over priced. They sold my wife a used rzr for 2500 more than what it would cost new and it was bone stock.(extra b.s) so after taking our Polaris to have serviced thru there speed pass.this is ruffy 1 year later cause hey I paid for why not use it. Well let's start off by saying this is the 3rd time the ploaris has been in for service.so dropped it off on a Tuesday and they tell me it will be ready on the next day. So the next day rolls around and I do not get a call to come pick it up. So the next day Thursday I call them and ask if it's ready to be picked up. They informed me yes it is ready. So let's load the trailer and go to pick it up.once getting there they hand me paper work and he goes to find my sxs. He is walking around everywhere in the shop to find this sxs. So I look at the paperwork and it is paperwork for a Honda i used to own not the Polaris so I tell him it's the ploaris not the Honda due to the Honda being in Texas now. They then go on to tell me that they just completeld the work on my Honda.so that's when I decided to let him know that it's in Texas. But yet they did the service and paperwork.once we found our ploaris we were told it would be ready the next day. So moving on to next day we get there to pick up the machine thsy has 150 hrs on it and they only do a 25 hr service on the machine. They cant tell me how many services it has had even tho they did it. So there goes our warranty  and extended warranty. Man this place is the biggest joke ever.
