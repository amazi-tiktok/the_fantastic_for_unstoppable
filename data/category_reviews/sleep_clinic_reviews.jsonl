Well as in any place you live there are many good things and there are not so good things that you experience.  We just came across a not so good thing and that is the Alabama Medical Group, P.C.  We were only with this PCM and the medical group for 3 or 4 months when we received in the mail a letter from them dismissing one of my family members.  The letter did not state any reason why only that they \u201cneed to do this from time to time.\u201d  When asked why our family member was dismissed their representative would not provide a reason and on top of that they were rude during our phone conversation.  As a Navy Captain (retired) who has been to many places in this world along with my family who have been with me through all of that,  this has been the most disappointing experience of my career and was upsetting for my family members.  As a result of this,  my entire family has now changed PCMs.  I hope this feedback will help the management of Alabama Medical Group to self reflect and make some changes for the better.

I drove 12 hrs. To get here only to find out at 1130pm. That part of my cpap mask was left at home 12hrs. Away. I went to a late night emergency clinic to find one only to find out they couldn't help. I then went to the emergency room at the closest hospital to find out theirs weren't comparable either.

See sleep Anna is nothing to play with, breathing can stop and kill you so going to sleep is dangerous.\n\nI went on line to see if any of the company's that delt with breathing equipment if they had any emergency after-hours  procedures.God is great. As I glanced through  all the options this one stuck out for the simple reason that they emphasized their care for late-night and emergency needs. My son and I called and left messages hoping that someone would call back.\n\nTheir advertisement said that after 12pm that their recording system would call back in the morning. But being it's a holiday I didn't think anyone would.  But by the grace of God around 1210 I was at the hospital emergency room when I got a call. To my surprise the caller wasn't the on call person but one of the owners themselves.\n\nSee he took the on-call because the on-call person tested positivefor Cov19 and he decided to not put anyone else on call.  He had never before  been on call. He met me at his office 15 minutes later, gave me a complete upgraded mask for  free.

We aren't happy about Medicare's policy of paying for oxygen, we hear complaints about it frequently and so do other oxygen companies, but ONeal Medical didn't create the \"gap\" and Medicare's low payment rates,\n\nYour insurance plan, Medicare, created this mess, not ONeal Medical.\n\nYes, it is up to our company to provide service for the entire 5 years, yet ONLY get paid for the first 3, and then for 2 whole years (the \"gap) basically free of charge. Bear in mind that over this entire 5 year period, we include:\n-24 hours service\n- maintain the equipment\n- free delivery\n-all tubing and supplies / filters\n-file paperwork on the patient's behalf,\n-and from time to time we even provide free oxygen service for patients who travel.\n\nWe would be happy to assist once the \"gap\" period is over, you have the option of privately purchasing a portable oxygen concentrator, but in no way we did we earn a 1 star review as  we feel your review is more a reflection of Medicare's onerous policy, perhaps your misunderstanding of such, but in no way of our company\u2019s performance.\n\nYou can call our office and ask to speak to one of the owners for a more detailed explanation if you wish, and you can call 1-800- MEDICARE as well.\n\nThe process of getting a portable oxygen concentrator, a fairly complex medical device, is VERY fact dependent, there are significant clinical issues to consider as well, so we would encourage you to contact us again so we can fully explain your options, but a 1 star review, no, that's simply not warranted.\n\nNot at all."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923a7d2fbe47d:0x1c69d6f4b259b17c"}
