My Mother was buried in September, 2019 my parents graves have sunk in, washed and the ground surrounding the headstone has eroded. I have been there personally to report this and have called almost daily with no return call. I expressed my concern with the condition of the cemetery and was told it sold in December and hopefully changes will be made. I went by the graves today and no improvement\u2019s have been made and in some areas the grass is almost knee high. This is not acceptable and I do hope this is taken care of before further action needs to be taken.EDIT:I have talked to the manager of the funeral home. He explained to me due to COVID and lack of workforce things have fallen behind. The headstone has been leveled and sand, new dirt, grass seed and new hay has been been put down on the grave sites. He was very nice and helpful even gave me his personal cell phone number if additional problems arise. He again assured me they are working hard to bring the cemetery back to the standards of the past. Very appreciative of his prompt actions and response.

There was NO direction provided by the funeral home staff. No one knew where to go or what to do. It was complete chaos. The family were scattered all over the chapel, not seated together as they should have been. The sound system was a complete joke as was the projection screen! You could barely see the pictures and they were very blurry.  There were/are NO PICTURES on the online obituary page after the family went to a tremendous effort to collect, scan and upload to the funeral home's planning webpage!  Those should have automatically transferred. Several attempts to upload pictures directly through the online site through the Share Memories section resulted in a locked up phone!!! The facilities are dated and drab, very depressing; in need of some serious renovations and updating. They had a last viewing for the family but before my husband could even get to the front they had already closed the coffin so he did not get a final chance to say goodbye to his Dad!!!!!! The whole thing felt rushed, as if they needed us to be gone so they could close the doors and go home. They did not even completely close the curtain. It was a disaster from start to finish. A very PRICEY disaster!! In summary; cheap quality, tacky and shoddy. I'm sure they are very busy, but then busy means more income, some of which needs to be applied to adding professional, trained staff and upgrading the facilities.
