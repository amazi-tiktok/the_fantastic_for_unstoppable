So basically we spent 20 minutes looking for clues that werent there then we sat in our room for over 30 minutes just waiting on someone to come help us and let us out. It was absolutely ridiculous. We still never got our money back and we refused to come back again for another \u201ccorrect\u201d room.

Ended up calling Jump To It Inc and asking why it was removed and brought up some negative reviews which we read on Google. First they told me there were some issues and they would call me back, never did. I called them again Monday the following week and they stated they had issues with the slide we rented and it was being repaired. The person whom I spoke with stated it \"should be\" good for our party but if I see another I like they will swap it out. So I go on their site and searched and had to pretend like I was going to reserve just to see what was available. This whole experience left me uneasy so I went with another company and cancelled the rental and they gave me a refund minus 30 dollars which is a surcharge and that's fine.\n\nFast forward to the day of the party and the delivery guy shows up to setup the slide. I explain to him we cancelled the order and he was nice and ended up leaving. Keep in mind above the party was 12 - 3, he shows up at 3.

We ended up changing the date of the event partly because of this issue and our event was rescheduled to the last weekend in July.

I called them and they couldn't come right back so the inflatable was down for about an hour of our 3 hour FUNDRAISER carnival.  As an \"I am sorry\" they offered a 50% discount on the next rental.   We decided to take them up on their offer and rented 2 inflatables for our Halloween Trunk or Treat.  Again, I asked them to be there at a certain time to leave plenty of time for set up and they were late again.  They pulled up 5 minutes before the event time and we had to block off our trunk or treat area and delay the start because their trucks were in the area of where the kids had to go.  They set up and left.  About 10 minutes into the carnival I got a call from a volunteer that there were 2 kids hurt on the inflatable because it wasn't staying inflated in the middle.  I inspected and it was not properly working.  I called Corey and he said he couldn't come back so we had to shut the inflatable down.  I communicated with him after the event about how unhappy we were and he informed me he would be sending a refund (I have this in a text message from him).  When I never got the refund he then said he would rather give us a discount on a future rental. I told him that we will never be renting from him again and we wanted the refund he told us he would be giving.  This business has ruined part of TWO fundraisers for a local elementary school and shows no remorse for the kids that got hurt.  We had two young children with bloody noses because of the improper equipment (there were not enough blowers on the inflatables, both times there were sections knotted off without blowers attached).  This is poor business practice and I would NEVER recommend ANYONE to use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x747bb8da09529022"}

You also have the option to \"upgrade\" your painting by purchasing a larger canvas.\nAnother thing that most of these places do is sell the paintings that the instructors do during every class. I wish I could say that they're affordable and worth the price, but that definitely is not the case. When I inquired about which paintings were for sale and about the general cost, the woman got snarky with me. After paying well over $100 to for little to no instruction and having an overall bland experience, I did not want to give this place any more of my money.\nPAINTER'S TIP:\nI would suggest stopping by Walmart (or ordering off Amazon) and getting a cheap variety pack of paintbrushes (I posted a photo of the pack I purchased).

It\u2019s filled with tons of activity centers like blocks, art, dress up, trains, a castle, a huge play ship in the center, a fire station room, movie theater, dance party, and many, many more awesome adventures!\nThey even have a large area squared off by a 2 foot wall/bench for caregivers and parents to play with their infants without toddlers trampling them but at the same time being perfectly located in the center of the main room with a view of the entire play area allowing parents with infants to watch their toddlers play. I recommend it to anyone with children ages newborn to around age 8.\nThey have so many different things to offer! Not to mention the owner who is an absolute delight! Every month she fills the calendar with innovative parties, exciting classes & events and things such as \u201cdate nights\u201d as well as weekly dance classes that don\u2019t require any signup or monthly commitment. In the mood to dance? Just show up on the designated days and boogie!\nThere\u2019s so much more I haven\u2019t even mentioned so just trust me and go check it out! You won\u2019t be disappointed!!! You\u2019ll be hooked just like me!\nExtremely reasonably priced, spotlessly clean and thoroughly sanitized as well as conveniently located! I\u2019m so impressed with this place! My first & only visit was today however rest assured I\u2019ll be returning next week :) and the next... I\u2019ll be recommending it to everyone I know!\nLOVE LOVE LOVES IT!!!\n1 last tidbit of bonus information...It\u2019s on the market! I certainly wish I had the means to buy what can only be described as an incredibly lucrative business that\u2019s sure to be a HUGE money maker for its new owners!\nMy guess is that you\u2019re thinking I must be benefiting from this review but I can assure you I am in no way benefiting nor do I have any connection whatsoever with anyone connected to the Wonderland Childrens Museum in any way. I\u2019m simply a local parent who took my daughter to her classmates birthday party there today.

I am absolutely appalled at the staffing of this establishment. My son and his friend (both 10) were physically assaulted by a group of teenagers (15). Now I know, kids can be wild but I had several adults that I didnt know run to find me when this happened. My older nephew attempted to intervene as these children were stomping on my sons stomach and forcibly holding him under the ball pit. I was informed by multiple adult witnesses who confirmed this was in fact what was happening. When my nephew tried to tell the boys to leave my 10 year old son alone the boys ADULT father bowed up on my nephew making threats yelling in his face. My nephew is also A CHILD. There were ZERO staff members to be found and when I was finally able to talk to a manager (Tiffany) I was disrespected and cut off mid sentence. She refused to hear my concerns. I was completely rational and calm as I was just trying to speak with someone in charge and have the cameras viewed so I could find out what actions should be taken. When asked to speak to someone above her she refused to give me any name or contact info and WALKED AWAY mid sentence. We have always enjoyed bringing our children here, but if I am paying for a party that large with that many children I would expect my guests to be SAFE. I would love to speak with someone above the managers on staff due to the absolute lack of professionalism they displayed. It is not my intention to be tacky or tasteless but I am shocked at how children being visibly injured was met by \"management\". This establishment should be well staffed for the level of children it sees on a nightly basis and all of the children should feel and BE safe. Staff members do not supervise in any way, like other trampoline parks do. spending close to 500$ for a 2 hour party, my child and his friend were jumped on kicked and bullied by 5 teenage boys and the manager (Tiffany) didn't even offer an apology or ask the children if they were okay.. nothing. My experience was awful. Tiffany would not hear my concerns, would not review the cameras and let me know the severity of the situation. Due to this, 5 kids left my sons party and I was left feeling a HUGE lack of customer service. The chosen manager of this establishment should put children first, listen to the concerns of paying patrons and have solutions. She was the most disrespectful manager I have ever met. I had my  son and his friend upset right in front of her and she barely looked at them, didn't ask if they were okay. She walked away.\n\nafter reaching out to an owner, I was not offered any resolution or an offer of looking at the camera. Simply \"I'll speak to tiffany about this\" and s\"orry this happened\". finally got the apology that should have happened days before but too little too late. what resolution would you expect if this happened at a party you were hosting and it was your children being hurt?\n\ngreat leadership comes from the top. get it together. while I know these specific incidents are isolated, you should know how to handle these situations and so should your staff. view  the cameras, even if the patron cannot. have a resolution.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890db69088959d:0x4332f45319ad0a5e"}

Please do not enter the building while anyone is in the air!!!!!\n\nPLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RIDE ANY OF THE AIR ATTRACTIONS HERE WITHOUT BEING ADVISED THAT AN AIR ROPES COURSE RIDER WHO APPEARED TO BE STILL STRAPPED IN THE HARNESS FELL SEVERAL FEET JUST LAST FRIDAY 3/29/19, AND THE COMMUNITY IS NOT AWARE OF THIS.  Don't let it be your kid please!  PEOPLE SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND BELOW WERE ALSO HARMED!!!!\n\nThis is important!! I'll repeat it.  If you plan to go and play it safe by not riding in the air, then this review is still for you and all of your family  because PEOPLE SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND BELOW WERE ALSO HARMED!!!!\n\nPlease read on or call to try to find out for yourself before you go.  I don't want it to happen again to anyone!!  I've tried many times for a week now, but I can't reach any local or corporate officials with Urban Air to explain or calm our fears.  Who checks on these things?  Who answers to every parent that takes their kids to Urban Air?\nIt's Friday again and I'm trying not to scream at the thought that Urban Air Trampoline and Adventure Park in Trussville is still open (as far as I know) and still not answering any real questions about last Friday's horrific experience.   This wasn't your average bounce on the trampoline and break an ankle thing. This was a HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE that really happened to innocent people.   Urban Air, what's preventing it from happening again?\n\nHow do you drop a person from the sky?  Why did you drop her on top of a mom who was simply sitting on a bench below? It Was Horrible!!! There is so much more to say, but graphic details are not appropriate or important here.\n\nI don't know if the other visitors there on Friday are just still too shaken up to talk about it.  Or just so relieved like us that their kid didn't fall.  Or maybe like me they hate to write online reviews (especially bad ones).  Well I would give Urban Air Trampoline Adventure Park in Trussville, Alabama negative 5 stars if I could, but I can't, so 1 horrible star.  Our little one has had a difficult time since he saw that horrible event on his last outing for Spring Break.  Thank goodness, he made it out ok.  Still, I'm so very sorry we chose  the Trussville Urban Air, but we knew other kids who enjoyed it there in the past.  I'm sorry to say we even teased a teenager who was too scared to ride, but he was wiser than us I guess.  We researched. We read the google reviews first. Obviously, not enough people write reviews.  We thought it was safe (trampoline park safe anyway).  We were wrong!   It's not even safe to sit on the benches and watch your babies.  And the lack of customer followup and consideration just adds to the mess.\n\nBecause of the layout of this Urban Air in Trussville, people on the ground are always under one of the air rides!  There should be a safety net or some type of separate area to keep kids above and kids and families below safe!!!!!!  We've visited Homewood Urban Air without a big problem. (Of course they don't have the air rope course and racer).\n\nPLEASE DON'T LET ANYONE YOU LOVE (OR HATE) SIT OR WALK AROUND ANYWHERE IN THIS URBAN AIR LOCATION WHEN SOMEONE IS RIDING ANY AIR ATTRACTION (even with a harness)!!!\n\nI hope this helps someone.  If you saw this, please speak up too and let people know.  It's time.  I can't believe the news didn't cover this.  I wish someone else said it sooner than me.  Every customer who was there Friday deserves answers, although not nearly as much as the injured victims.  We hope and pray they are alive and OK.  Every potential customer deserves answers so that it doesn't happen again.\n\nUrban Air in Trussville, I don't see how you are still open and promoting Birthday packages. But since you are, PLEASE PROTECT YOUR PATRONS( that includes kids riding and also includes moms and babies sitting and watching below)!!   I hope you are at least answering and helping the people you seriously hurt last Friday.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554563277949, "text": "Hi Kim,\r\rThis is Carolyn from the Corporate office.
