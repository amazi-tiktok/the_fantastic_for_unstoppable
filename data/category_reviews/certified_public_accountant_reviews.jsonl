First of all, whoever was seen walking past, if you were told I was not in the office, was not me. We do not have t-shirts advertising our business so I would question if you were even at our office, since you have inaccurate information. Secondly, we are not employees of the HOA, we are contracted by the HOA board to handle certain accounting functions and provide the board with requested reports. Similar to any business, the reports are disseminated from the top (HOA) to those who need to know. Privacy laws are very strict and we try to adhere to them diligently. If you want more access to information of your HOA, I suggest you become a member of the board. As I understand it, several requests have been made for more board participation but thus far there have been no takers. If you become a board member, we would be glad to share appropriate information with you."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923974a207565:0x2ceecc8546a453f4"}
