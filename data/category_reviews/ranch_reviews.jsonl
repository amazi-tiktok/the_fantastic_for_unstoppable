But it doesn't matter because if you don't smoke you're not going to be able to breathe if you go in there to eat. Because the owner lets people smoke where they want to. The non-smoking and smoking section is a joke because it is not separated. They have a room in the back corner which is on the non-smoking side of the restaurant. We were in there the other day to eat. We usually go in that room to eat to get away from the smoke. When we got there we were told that there was a room full of people in there smoking. We almost walked out but my husband said he was starving. So we found a table in the corner with a wall next to it by the door that was somewhat okay to sit at to eat. I think that if people want to have a restaurant with people that smoke in it they ought to be honest about if they have a non-smoking section or not. Just be honest and say people can smoke wherever the heck they want to, like at the Ranch House. From now on we will be getting takeout food from the Ranch House because it stinks so bad of smoke inside that we can't stand to sit in there.
