One of them who is make went up to pay for an item, and I was right beside him waiting to pay for my item once he paid for his. The clerk finished my roommates transaction, I set my item on the counter to be rung up, and the clerk just walked away. Not long after that he and the other clerk walked outside via the back door.\n\nAt that point I was tempted to just take my item and walk out the door. What I ended up doing was just leaving it on the counter and walking out of the store.\n\nI have no idea why the clerk ignored me and my item. Part of me wonders if it's because I'm female and he didn't think I could possible be purchasing anything. It could also be that he was just about to go on a smoke break and couldn't be bothered to handle one more customer. There are so many possibilities, and all I can do is guess.
