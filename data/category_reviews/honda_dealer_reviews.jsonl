I also very much appreciated the honesty and integrity he displayed which also is a big reason I chose the Scag, I was lied to by a salesman at John Deere at one dealership and another dealership I was told that he could sell me the mower for the price but he wouldn\u2019t make much so he didn\u2019t want to sell it, those 2 experiences alone helped me decide that my after the sale experience probably would be as sorry also.

I bought a truck from them at an outrageous price (had no options at the time and needed a truck A.S.A.P. for business) and I have spent over $5,000 fixing it in the 6 months I've owned it. I was told by Lee and the \"salesman\" that the truck was $11,000, only to charge me $13,000. Of course once I realized what they did and contacted them they play dumb and it is too late. I know if I should have taken more time to review and ask questions but it was the end of the day, past business hours already and I needed to leave with the truck that day. Regardless you should never practice those business ethics in any industry. I have had to change the rotors, brakes, brake drums, brake cylinder, master cylinder, calipers and brackets, hub assembly, CV axles, steering arm, I am in the process of changing the transfer case (over $2,000 on it's own) and it still needs a steering column, gear box, front differential, driveshaft and possibly the rear differential. When it's all said and done I will have put at least 5 times the value of this truck into making it run right and paying it off. I am a self employed remodeler and I have missed countless days of work, lost countless jobs and it's gotten to the point that I am having trouble paying for my daughters daycare and buying her essentials.

This was my second brand new $10,000+ Honda.  I recently purchased a $10,000+ KTM elsewhere (Not from Halls) because I could not get this dealer to work with me.\n\nFirst Red Flag, the bike had 14 miles on it at delivery.  I guess someone took it home for the night...  (They did disclose the mileage at the time of sale.)\n\nLater, I had some issues and wanted the bike looked at under warranty.  I was told they would charge me to look at it if they could not submit a warranty claim to Honda.  This is lack of basic customer service.  If you want your customers to come back you take care of them.  Take care of your customer and they will take care of you.\n\nLater still, I wanted to trade in my paid off bike that I purchased from them for a new one.  They told me if I wanted to trade in that they would \"give me a good price\" for my bike because I bought it from them and I'm buying another.  Great!!!, or so I thought...  They offered me about 80% of my motorcycles KBB Trade in Value.  80% of Trade In!!!  My bike is in like new condition, air conditioned garage kept!!\n\nSo long story short, I guess I am done with Mobile Honda.  I guess I wont rule out Halls in general...
