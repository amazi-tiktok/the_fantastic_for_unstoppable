After leaving, unfortunately, I was unimpressed, but because we all have \"bad days\", my first instinct was to give them another chance.\nThe day of my follow-up cleaning (2 weeks later), I sent a text to confirm my appt time - since I did not receive a text reminder - like I did for the initial cleaning.  After a short time had past, with no reply, I called and spoke to Chrissy.  Although I did not call to complain, I did mention that I was not satisfied with my first cleaning - and why, but explained that - because everyone has bad days - I was waiting for this cleaning to see how things went.  I must say, once on the phone, Chrissy was very responsive and willing to make everything right.\nNow to the GOOD stuff...  Whitney and Melissa.  These 2 ladies are THE BOMB!  They came in - WORKED HARD, and had my house \"sparkling\" when they left - so much so - that upon their departure, I immediately sent  Chrissy another text message - PRAISING their work and asking to have these 2 young ladies clean my house from now on.  (Sadly - I am still awaiting a response.)\nIt is women like Whitney and Melissa who make a business look - not just good - but impeccable!!!! - and all the bad bearable.  (Two Maids and a Mop - Auburn needs to do all they can do to keep these 2 ladies happy and working for them!)\nI sincerely hope I hear back from Chrissy soon - saying - yes to my request. \ud83d\ude00", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e8bc654731:0x76a1661ea305ee05"}

To clarify, when I entered the information online I was given the price of $140 dollars. I THEN spoke with a representative of the company who clarified the first clean would be a deep clean, but never stated this would result in a higher cost. I was completely misled to believe my fee would be the $140 versus almost $400. When I called to discuss they could not give me a rational for why the price was as expensive as it was and accused me of lying on the internet submission regarding occupancy and square footage even though I told the woman I spoke to on the phone I lived with my boyfriend and two dogs. Completely unprofessional, dishonest and clearly have poor business ethics. Additionally, when I informed them I\u2019ve used cleaning services for a number of years and have never been charged that much for an initial clean (and told them the name of the company I had used in my previous rental), they eluded to the fact that the company in question was not professional or a legitimate business.

As I understand you booked your clean online.  There is some expectation that folks who enter data requested for booking online will provided accurate data.  When booking online you indicated you had 0 pets, 1 occupant, and your square footage was 2200.   My understanding is you have 2 occupants and 2 pets per your phone conversation.    Your clean was actually discounted based on less occupants and no pets.\n\nMy understanding is you had no issues with the service other than price.  Hard to address what you heard or did not hear during the call with our office as it relates to price.  We certainly try to communicate price as part of any booking but your reaction indicates you did not hear it or we failed to communicate it.\n\nLastly, based on your call your position was discount or negative reviews.  Unfortunately we do run into this situation 1 or 2 times per year.   Certainly don't like failing to meet your expectations, but will not be coerced into discounts by threats either.  You bear some responsibility to understand the services you have secured. This would certainly be an exception for one of our customers to invite us into their home to clean and not know what services they will receive and what they will cost.\n\nAny desire to discuss further just call the office and let Chrissy know you want to chat with the owner and she will put us in touch."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e8bc654731:0x76a1661ea305ee05"}

In fact, after your Thanksgiving clean you texted \u201cthe girls did a really good job\u201d.\n\nToday you turned our team away and were charged a cancellation fee.  These type fees are always a tough decision as a business owner.   You know a negative review might be coming because you stuck by your cancellation policy.  In most cases it is the right thing to do for the PHC's whose earnings will be impacted by the late cancellation. For 99% of customers this simply is not a problem as we share this policy in our Welcome Packet.\n\nLike most service companies we do utilize computer scheduling.  We offer multiple cleaning packages.  We even offer custom packages.  Cost will vary based on requirements. What we do is complete the clean as defined in the package you purchase.  Most customers prefer to know what they will receive and want it done consistently.\n\nNow let me offer you some feedback as the owner.  I have owned this location since it opened.  We are not perfect but strive to improve every day.  After speaking with multiple members of our team it is clear to me that your goal was to bully your way out of a fee you were fully informed of.  You were extremely abusive and spoke down to all of our team members on the day after Christmas of all days.\n\nWhile I can empathize with your frustration with being charged a cancellation fee I would challenge to treat people with dignity and respect in the future.  If you cannot do that then I suspect most small business owners like myself would prefer you take your business somewhere else.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

We went back to check everything out almost 4 days after the service came through, and found my thermostat (that I had previously turned off since no one was living there) was running and had been running 24/7 on 65 degrees, and my bedroom fan was still running. So now we will be paying the electric bill for those almost 4 days where my air conditioner had been left to run on a very high setting. Opened the closet with the water heater and there was still dog hair all around the floor, the oven had not been cleaned out, there were flecks of dirt in the bathtub that were not there when I moved out, and nothing around the washer/dryers had been cleaned out. We also went through and re-mopped the floors, and there was dirt coming up on the mopping pads as if the floors had barely been touched. When we sent the photos to the manager, she called my mother back to argue with her that the apartment was very dirty and that they don\u2019t touch water heaters. Apparently sweeping up the floor around the water heater is considered messing with it? This also does not explain the dirty oven, the dirt in the tub that was not there before, and the utilities that had been turned on and left on high for days. All she did was half heartedly offer to come help my mom clean (we had already cleaned up after them so we declined), and no apologies or attempts to reconcile for these other issues were made. She literally only called my mom back to argue with her. $200 later for an hour cleaning of a 450 sq foot apartment, and we had to go spend another hour cleaning up all the stuff they left behind.\n\nIf you don\u2019t leave your apartment spotless, which defeats the entire purpose of having a cleaning service come in (I\u2019m not talking leaving it absolutely filthy and covered in trash, but needing reasonable deep cleaning after 2 years of living there), then don\u2019t even bother hiring this service. If you have any complaints or concerns you\u2019ll be argued with and no attempts to reconcile or partially reimburse will be made. Seriously, this service is very overpriced for the service you receive. Hopefully you\u2019ll find better cleaners elsewhere.
