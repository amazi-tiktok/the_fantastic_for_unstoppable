The following day Patriot followed up with us to see how things went. They did not get the business, yet they were concerned enough to follow up.  I told them we used the Birmingham Police instead and they told us if we ever needed them, they were there for us.  This was powerful and left quote an impression on us. Therefore, the following week, when we needed security, we called Patriot. They were professional, thorough and timely. They assigned Officer Demarcus to us.  The next day when we arrived Officer Demarcus was already there, outside, ready to go. He was attentive, followed our instructions to the letter and very focused.  He was present without being obvious. Our members wanted to know there was security but they did not want to be reminded that we needed security. Officer Demarcus did an excellent job and put our members at ease with his low key, competent demeanor.

My encounter with McDowell security occurred 4.7.19 at the Outlet Shops of Grand River in Leeds, AL and was very unpleasant, unprofessional and unnecessary .  My group of 4 people (2 adults and 3 youth) were approached in the parking lot of the Grand outlet by a male and female in a golf cart as we were walking from our vehicle parked far out in the parking lot.  We were asked if we were attending the Barber Motorsports event and we replied yes, but were going to do some shopping first.  We were told that there were designated parking spaces to catch the bus to attend the Barber Motorsports, but as stated we were going to shop first and then attend the event and we had looked for parking in the designated areas upon 1st arriving and were unable to locate a parking space.  After walking through the Grand Rivers outlet, we approached the gate to head toward the buses.  When approaching the gates, we asked if we were at the correct entrance to board the buses to go to the event, only to find out that the man in the golf cart had contacted security to provide our description and inform them not to let us through the gate until we moved our vehicle!  The security guard stated that our PROFILE met the description of the group that was not parked in the correct location and that he would not let us through until we moved.  This was handled very unprofessionally and the whole incident could have been avoided for the following reasons. 1. AT no point in time did the man in the golf cart tell us that it was MANDATORY, for us to move to get through a gate to board a bus.  2. At no point and Time ever is the Leeds outlet full of cars, ESPECIALLY parked far out,  so our parking would not have inconvenience anyone.  3. We were patrons to the outlet too and were not treated as such.  This was a very disheartening event and not behavior that one would want 1st time youth attending the event to encounter.
