Since my initial visit to the McGee rd service facility back in December,  which did an excellent job, I have had 2 bad experiences.  1st bad experience was with my wife's car. She had the oil changed at the eastern blvd facility.  Approximately 1 week later her car's check engine light came on and the fault was for dirty oil. She had the oil checked at a local change facility and it was a quart low. They did another oil change, and I have the filter from that change and it is not as clean a filter as you think from 1 week previous. I had also gotten my oil changed in my truck a few days after she did at the eastern Blvd facility.  So I decided to take a look at my oil and filter. The filter on my truck had an install date written on it from the McGee Rd facility of 12/9/19. The date I first got Express to change it. They supposedly changed my oil and filter on 2/7/20 at McGee rd. I will also attach a pic of the filter . Needless to say this is a very bad way to run a business.  Engine damage from dirty oil is very significant possibility from these action.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO43eqZAxl6i36R5mIsoxQpWPbaVCPg79nGVXA2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1582925050257, "text": "Hi there, Ernest.

It was the perfect storm of bad timing, incredibly delayed roadside service, and the literal annoyance of cold and rainy weather. I looked up tire mechanics in the area and happened upon these guys. After a couple of calls to let them know i was still awaiting a tow truck, we realized I might not even make it to them before closing time. And on top of that, if it was deemed that I did need a new tire, they might not have what I needed. It was at this point that the managers asked me where I was located! Wyatt and Sam actually drove to where I was, helped me put my spare tire on, and assisted me safely to the shop. They were busy, and still took incredible care of me. I truly can't thank the team there enough. The customer service is off the charts. Everyone was personable and kind, the shop itself is clean and orderly, and they got me taken care of super fast! Honestly, I am just so thankful to have encountered such a great team. Its too bad I'm not a local, but I'm very thankful that it was in Calera that my tire blew. :) THANKS AGAIN Y'ALL!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1612996890750, "text": "Hi, Britt, thank you for the positive feedback!

I brought my car in a week ago because the front end of the car was not driving properly. RoadMart said that they could not replicate the issue but they did see I needed my tires balanced, I let them balance my tires and when I left I was having the same issues. I brought my car back and then they said the tires were  separating on the inside, so I paid 367 for four brand new tires. Replacing the tires only helped the car drive smoother but the problem was now worse! So I brought my car back today and now there saying that the back tires are the cause of the front tires shifting and that wasn't something they could fix, I would have to take it to the dealership. The guy said he could try to align the front to see if that would help but it made the issue even worse then when I had initially brought the car in. I am now sitting here after closing hours so they can set my alignment back to were it was. I just feel like if they were unable to repair the car in the first place then they should've said so instead of me coming out of 446 dollars for no reason. I asked if I could a refund for the alignment and the guy said that he wouldn't be able to refund me, would have to wait until next call and ask for a refund or he could credited as two free oil changes which is not acceptable for my inconvenience", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293c0a719e971:0x35d4a5b6c0bf8d4a"}

Be careful if you have insurance; once I brought up that my insurance might cover the work, the owner got really shady and kept telling me that it wasn't a good idea to contact my insurance company.

When I finally got the owner on the phone, he protested that the job would cost me about $6,000, but calling around and showing the invoice to other mechanics in the area, they told me they would do the same job for about $4,000. I ended up having the car towed to the dealership because of the bad vibes I got with APT.\n\nIn summary, I cannot attest to their expertise fixing the car, but I definitely didn't like their low level of professionalism.

Brian took the time to diagnose my issue, explain what he would do to my vehicle, how the part worked and why the part that needed replacing wasn't working properly. After the repair, Brian took the time to have me look and listen to the new part, showed me the broken part before he disposed of it and even gave me some insight to another belt that may need replacing at a certain point.

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

NOT TODAY!!! So I did a Google search and came across HESCO, the reviews were great, I spoke with Joe Molina and he arranged to have it tower to HESCO \"DESPITE being in the middle of changing locations\", they got it in checked it out, started it up, \"No white smoke from the tail pipe\", turned out to be the water pump, THAT's ALL. I can't recommend Joe Molina and the guys at HESCO Automotive highly enough, they are highly professional, extremely efficient, keep you informed at every juncture of the process, and very reasonable.

He asked multiple times if it was ready, was told only 20 more mins, then 30...well 2 hours after the said time he left. We had plans at 11am, so those didn't happen WHICH could have been planned for-like loading up my kids (one being a newborn) in the car and picking him up. No apologies for the extra wait time and never honest about how long it was going to take.\nCome that following week, SURPRISE, there was an oil leak on the garage floor AND the check engine light was back on. So we took it back once again. He was told that it was just old oil coming out and it was fine and that some other piece needed to be replaced for the check engine light. Like why wasn't this fixed the first time!? Unless we got super unlucky and something went wrong within the 3/4 day time.\n\nWell now it's about 4 months later and there's still oil spots on the floor!\nSo we called today, I got a so-so person on the phone and was told to bring it back in, no \"oh my goodness! That's not what we like to hear..please bring it back in!\" It was just \"bring it back\".\n\n1st, can we make the comparison on the comment from Ashton Morgan below?? This was the SAME day, the SAME time and my husband remembers talking and waiting with Ashton.\nWe aren't very knowledgable on car repairs and we should've gotten a 2nd opinion(the Garage in Pelham is literally walking distance and everyone always has great things to say about them, but this was just for a cheap oil change-never again!) ..but we just had a baby and didn't have much spare time or sleep to decide these things with a clear mind.\n\nI just reccomend going somewhere else for piece of mind EVEN for an oil change, even if this was just a random bad day (which look at the rating-use your brains people! We didn't and now we're paying for it with our time and now a nasty driveway and garage floor) for the people working on cars, there has yet to be a verbal apology-and now if we get one it will just seem forced.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1463972408579, "text": "Dear Jennifer,\nMy name is Rick and I am the owner of Precision Tune Auto Care of Pelham.

The fact that some key parts needed are unavailable for this particular vehicle is no fault of his or ourselves or speak to the skill and talent of our technician, nor the honesty of our business. 4) After we communicated to your son we could not source parts needed, we agreed to remove the parts we had already installed and did not charge his any labor for this authorized work.\n\nWe are disappointed to find a review not based on your own experience with us a customer.  Negative reviews with no merit harm our business and our hard-working employees and their families.

We do not rebuild transmissions, but we do remove and replace transmissions with either used transmissions or remanufactured transmissions.

I am not sure if this was your husband or not, but we can replace a torque convertor because it is physically attached to the transmission and is not an internal part.

I normally avoid chain stores like Firestone because I know they try to scam people, but it was my last option to get my car examined.  I was helped by a woman I think was named Sabrina, and she fed me the biggest scam I've heard with my car, I don't think she realized I knew more about cars than she probably did.  She told me the tires were done and needed to be replaced NOW, the air filters needed replaced NOW, the battery was dead and needs replaced NOW, and the radiator needed to be flushed - and they'd conveniently do all of this for me at a hefty premium.  I was silently laughing at myself because two of my tires had 20K miles left on them (yes the other two need replacing soon), my air filters were replaced 8 months ago, my battery was brand new (I took it to auto zone AND advanced auto parts and they showed me the readings and the charge was fantastic, they laughed at Firestone for trying to pull one over on me), my radiator was also flushed within the last year.  I finally called her out on the battery and she looked me right in the eye and had the immoral audacity to say the battery was still worthless.  These are common things places like Firestone try to trick people into having repaired, because most people don't have the knowledge to know any better.  It was funny because they didn't even identify the things that were wrong with my car that I knew about.  They checked off that both headlights were working great, even though I knew and verified that one of the front headlights was dead... did they really even look my car over or just pretend to then hand me an appraisal for all the \"broken\" items I needed to have them fix now?  If you do not know much about cars, do not trust Firestone, they will sense your naivete and pull a fast one on you.  Always get a second opinion from a more reputable garage shop (I prefer privately owned places that rely on their honesty for business).  This just reaffirms the longstanding distrust I've had for places like Firestone, avoid them if you care about your money and your vehicle's longevity.

Tried to sell me an alignment with no explanation.  When I asked to see the numbers one wheel was so slightly off that I really beleive it could be calibration error as the old tires showed no signs of uneven wear and the car never pulled.  Today I went in for an apppointment at 9:00 am.  Every bay was full and I was told they were \"down 3 techs\".  Took 2 hr and 15 min for rotate and balance and oil change.  I specifically asked twice to include the full size spare in the rotation.  Left only to see it was not done.  Incidently, it's running the same air filter as on last visit and today it was \"fine\".  They also did not mention an issue with the suspension they said was problematic before.  So if today they were really busy and everything was \"fine\", and last time they were not as busy and they offered multiple unnecessary services, makes me wonder about how much pressure they get to \"sell\" services OR if, when they are busy, they don't do a thorough inspection.

When I picked it up drove toward Wal-Mart it immediately got hot so the looked at it again right before closing then i leave again same thing finally I park in publix to let it cool down. Again in the morning I take it back. Again they check it send me on my way 30 minutes later car hot again. I call and was pretty much brushed off and was told that they fixed what they thought was the problem. So as of right now I've been charged all this money car still running hot n they acting like it's cool I came in with 1 problem which has still not to be resolved. I will I'm so disappointed I travel alot for work and I'm in Alabama all alone no family I came here expecting a1 service seeing that it's connected to a napa but to spend this type of money and my issue not be fixed I'm so disappointed.

Again, it's a long wait, but I understand. At about 3, another customer comes in for a new battery. He is given an estimate that it will be about 5 when his vehicle is ready. At 3:45 both of our cars are taken to the back by the same technician. Again, this is already 15 minutes past my estimated completion time. My car is lifted, and the oil is drained. The tech then moved to the battery change, and worked there until it was completed at 4:15. He then disappeared, then came back and finished my oil change at 4:45. Again, I am a reasonable customer, but having another customer moved in front of me for no reason, causing me to wait for nearly 4 hours is absolutely unacceptable.

The customer service man asked me what was wrong with my vehicle, then asked me for the key. He went out and took my car for a test drive, then onto the rack. I waited in the lobby waiting area for a very brief time and then he came back. He told me I had a couple of options. Option one included replacing brake rotors and option two, pads only. I took the less expensive option two because money was tight. My total bill was HALF of what I assumed it would be. At JacMac, the difference is simple. They don't seem to want to drain your checking account like other places around Tuscaloosa who want to bill you no less than 1000 dollars every time you walk in the door. And I really like that he OFFERED me the different options. Most places dont do that.

When they returned, the vehicle had been discounted, but they added a \"fee.\" That's the only thing he would say, \"a fee.\" They were trying to deliberately be vauge and, in our opinion, dishonest. After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have.

I know it's all to protect them from liability suits. What ever happened to trust, recommendations, honest opinions? Every answer to every question seemed will rehearsed. Two days later my alternator goes out! Maybe a coincidence, but it seems like everyone I put my trust in the professionals, things start going wrong with my car. Don't trust mechanics, lawyers, maintenance individuals, had one of them tell me, \"if we fix it too well, we'll be out of a job, always have to leave something for another day.\" There's no real honest people in this area, not anymore. Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts? A little extreme, they did an estimate but I never got to see it, I asked to see the defective part, but was given the excuse we would have to put it back on the lift. Since it wasn't on the lift, they had no plans to fix it!\n\nAllen from Phenix Firestone called, his only concern was why I was so critical of him. I thought that was clear, but this was the second time I took this vehicle there for the same issue, the first time I was told nothing was wrong with it. In any case in order to resolve the problem Allen stated, \"we're not working in your cars anymore!\" I guess I hurt his feelings?\n\nI used to love taking a vehicle to Phenix Firestone, always felt like they were looking out for me, always trusted them! Now I get the feeling I'm unimportant, it's really changed over the years!\n\nEnough said hope you all have a great holiday I'll be home fixing my cars!

I left several messages, tried calling my appointed service tech, sent an email and even had a conversation with the online chat. This happened Wednesday night- Thursday. I finally received a response, via email, stating my truck was finished. Total cost was just over $300.00. The recall work was covered, the cost was for the rental. All of the work I requested to have completed was not finished. The invoice didn't even reflect my request, the issues my truck is having or why I brought to them.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.

A new water pump was installed, but didn't last 100 miles. I returned the vehicle only to have the auto shop refuse to replace the water pump free of charge. I removed the water pump that weekend to find they cross threaded the new water pump and warped the unit. No wonder it did not function properly. After re-tapping a couple of screws and several hours out of my Saturday I replaced the new pump myself. Now I am out the price of another water pump, thanks a lot.\n\nMany people do not know this, but each repair job has an attached amount of time associated with it. So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either. Basically the repair guy did not remove all the necessary components (like a radiator) to save some time and shoved the water pump in at an angle.\n\nI will never use them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn.

I didn't know for sure exactly where or what was causing it, didn't want to spend my only free evening of the week with my wife and kid trying to figure it out, but also didn't want to leave a leak overnight so I took off work early to go get it fixed.  My vehicle needed an oil change as well anyway so I took it in and explained it was likely the filter or one of the lines that needed replaced.\n\nSure they changed my oil no problem, but the guy came around and said he wouldn't fix the leak, that it was a \"missing o-ring that they didn't carry in stock\" and I'd need to take it back to whoever put the existing filter on and have them do the repair.  Now, I replace my filters every 40,000 miles or so and I've moved a couple of times since then.  I have no idea where I was exactly when I replaced my filter last, because it's a small fix.  I got there at 4:30 pm, close of business at 6, so it wasn't like I pulled up at quitting time.  I had to take more time off work the next morning to disconnect everything myself and find it was simply a hairline crack in the filter.  The mechanic that I talked to didn't even verify anything, except what I already knew that yep there's a fuel leak there.  He just spewed some bs that he thought sounded good because he didn't feel like doing his job...

After an issue with one of the $$$ tires purchased, I found out they are not a typical stock item and I'd have to wait for several days. Since I needed it repaired immediately, I drove directly to Pete Shirley and told them to get close on the orginal tires ratings (speed/trac/hardness) with something they normally stock and replace all 4. Not only did they drive the same,  they were significantly cheaper than the big name brands. The biggest plus, I was back on the road in about an hour. I've waited over 4hours at some places in the past. Since, I've replaced tires on my other 4 vehicles using Pete Shirley. Asked them to put on something they normally stocked on these 4 vehicles, and all road out great, and in and out of the store in a timely manner. They also don't sell the gimmicky road side warranty.

It did not solve the problem, so they took everything apart and replaced my coil - saying we will not charge you for what you do not need - nor charge you for the additional labor.

They are very professional, kind, and pleasant to work with.\n\nI had a blow out, on Friday, September 7th on I-459 while driving South @ 5:45 pm. I hit SIRI on my phone and located the closest tire store to my location and I sure am glad she steered me towards Darrin Gilliam and his team. I slowly limped my way to the store and got out at 5:55pm on Friday afternoon and Mr. Gilliam asked how he could help me. I told him I needed a tire that I just had a blow out and was traveling to Hale County and needed to get home. He checked his inventory, but did not have the tire size I needed, but went well above and beyond to find one for me. He had two other guys and himself on phones calling all around to different stores trying to locate one and I was worried about them closing the doors at 6 pm, but he stated they do not close the doors until all customers are taken care of and would not leave me stranded.\n\nAfter locating a tire and having it brought there, Darrin Gilliam, Jasson Trammell and Matt Ramirez installed the tire and rim and helped me get back on the road. I have never ever been to ANY BUSINESS 5 minutes before closing time and especially on a Friday afternoon to receive great customer service like this. These gentleman stayed over with smiles on their faces just to make sure I was taken care of, regardless of the time.  While I was waiting, I did notice this location was very well organized and everyone there worked together as a team. This store definitely has their ducks in a row.\n\nThe management and workforce in this store is \"bar none\" the best I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t live close enough to do business with this store, but I will recommend anyone in this area to make this your \u201cgo to place\u201d for all of your automotive needs. I will check out the store in Tuscaloosa and see if their standards are as good as this store on 5036 Bond Blvd. Thanks again guys for all your professional and kind help on a short notice at quitting time on a late Friday afternoon. This store should win the store of the year award!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536677351270, "text": "Chad, thank you for taking the time to share your positive Express Oil Change & Tire Engineers experience!
