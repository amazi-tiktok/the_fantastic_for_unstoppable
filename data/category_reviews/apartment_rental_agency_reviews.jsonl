I have complained multiple times with no necessary actions taken to fix the issue, I even went as far as noticing when the people moved out of the apartment that I SIGNED A LEASE ON, and they told me no problem we can move you in there, FOR A 400$ MOVING FEE. Do what??? Please save yourself some trouble and DO NOT move here. There is a VERY GOOD REASON they are running move in specials and have immediate openings!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2dd89b17363:0xfeea1a9100e24d89"}

This place is one of the WORST places out there ! Pest control is a literal joke ! I was literally seeing spiders the size of my hand. There were roaches everywhere! I made sure NEVER to leave food out and I cleaned on the regular. The amount of roaches that are there is absolutely disgusting. I told her twice I needed an exterminator. For months she gave me the run around. I got bit and everything and she still gave me the run around. I kept seeing people throw perfectly good mattresses with bed bug zip up sheets. (I know what they look like bc my parents got bed bugs while traveling 7 years ago) That was a red flag! No too long after I found a full size bed bug!!!! At first she tried telling me it wasn\u2019t a bed bug ( Even though I kept the bed bug for her to see) . Then she told me the mattresses were from people moving out. Who throws a perfectly good mattress out? Finally, (after keeping the spiders and bed bugs for her to see) the exterminator came and basically said I brought the bed bug in even though I had not traveled or stayed at anyone\u2019s house or been to anyone\u2019s house.( I was new to Huntsville) So he told me I had gotten it from a restaurant, when the bed bugs  are only active from like 2am-5am. He told me not to treat the apartment with bed bug stuff from Home Depot bc it would make it wors and told me I would have to pay out of pocket to pay for a \u201cprofessional\u201d bed bug treatment. Btw the Home Depot stuff worked. The day we moved out , someone dumped a couch and it was INFESTED with bedbugs. You could literally see them crawling around on it. So please tell me you don\u2019t have a bed bug infestation.  My boyfriend told her months before we were going to move out when the lease was up. She tried to charge us two more months rent because we \u201cdidn\u2019t give her a notice  \u201c then she said she didn\u2019t remember that us telling her . We refused but we still had to pay just one more month of rent. Also, she does not reply to emails or calls ! Like NEVER ! I had to blow up her inbox a few times to even get a reply and even then she wouldn\u2019t. One time my boyfriend called her right before I walked into the office and she literally let it ring. 2 seconds later I walked in and told her my boyfriend had just tried calling so we could all talk. She said the phone never rang, but I had heard the phone ring just before I walked in.

We\u2019re sorry your Tara Garden experience has not lived up to your expectations. We offer pest control every Tuesday upon request. When you experience a need for service, the best course of action is to submit a work order to ensure your need has been properly entered into our service queue. Reports of bed bugs, while rare, are something we take extremely seriously. While bed bugs are primarily active at night and acquired through travel, they can come from various sources such as restaurants, theaters, or other public spaces. Sealing and removing mattresses from the home is the proper course of action to take if an instance of bed bugs has occurred. However, many people keep their mattresses in protective coverings for sanitary purposes unrelated to pests. Our procedure for the treatment of bed bugs is very thorough and involves detailed steps to ensure any presence of these insects is eliminated. The couch you mentioned was removed from our property the same day it was placed curbside. Inspection of your apartment revealed no presence of bedbugs beyond the specimen you found, and further treatment, though offered for your peace of mind, was not required. Our leasing agreement states notice must be given in writing 60 days prior to move-out. We apologize for any miscommunication concerning this issue. In a show of good faith, we adjusted your lease to month to month, which only requires a 30 day notice. Our residents are our highest priority, and our staff are trained to answer all emails and calls or return them promptly. We apologize if you feel your communications were not treated with the importance they deserve. We would be happy to discuss these matters further if you would visit the office or call (256) 830 4878 at your convenience."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626ea6c4a44073:0xdcd9c88d82db97df"}

Appears that one of their own property managers left a five-star review.  And four of their five-star reviews come from people with the last name Hayley, same as the owner. (Maybe it's a coincidence!) It's almost funny.\n\nRead through these reviews and you'll notice a trend that explains Hayley's poor ratings everywhere: they start with poor quality and end with scamming you out of your deposit. My pregnant wife and I spent 3+ hours on our hands and knees scrubbing our rental house top to bottom before we moved out. It was far cleaner than when we moved in. We discovered $100+ was kept from our deposit because we \"didn't have it professionally cleaned\" -- which is not even a requirement of the lease. I provided photographic evidence that we cleaned up messes that Hayley had never addressed when we moved in, proving that we left the place cleaner than Hayley did. (See photos below for before and after.) Their lawyer said our photos were selective and that we were \"belittling\" their efforts -- says the person who penalized a pregnant woman for cleaning 3+ hours. Nor did Hayley specify what we failed to clean, much less photographic evidence to prove it. All this to say that Hayley appears to automatically deduct $100+ from deposits for cleaning yet doesn't use that fee to clean the place to their own supposed standards.\n\nThis was just the last of many frustrations. Ants and roaches were present when we moved in. Here too we picked up for Hayley's slack and hired exterminators. Hayley's lease requires tenants to maintain the yard but when we moved in, we discovered the yard filled with bamboo and 1+ foot of pine straw (no wonder there were bugs). We asked Hayley to fix it; they sent a maintenance crew that cut the bamboo and left everything else. I spent all week raking it up.\n\nFinally, the property was quite literally rotting on the outside. (Again, no wonder there were bugs.) The owner clearly was attempting to put as little maintenance into the property as possible. I think Hayley is coasting on the Auburn housing market, but it won't take much for a competitor to pick up their slack.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvN2eQVtoi0SQGAcfy6tyL1GD7aSxMtFDS5nyR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSfYxcEl8eRiaOGP1OssoaPdCvsGHf96xhNusd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvQ7HCQqySLqwzzIj8c6iqas_rXgF4NpKj9L1j=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtSfISquaxR8YozlqLVBOYJ2IUaUhwzaAYLeer=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSw48agcU-r-6MKBgRiTUjkbWGuV3PWYknDcww=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9hJgmOGevlVyoSahL4BQ_deo6QZn3dgaSywZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBklQXQranYZFILQmYpaAMjIxW1vyCfFpNfWYZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzAOK_yUoBfVrwwsLXa9E_3ZhjPWJLrS4lTy7U=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8VVTgat3HNyRvPJzk4vn_CiHKXSqBNHgsBTQA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

The current tenets had four months left on their lease so we had Haley stay on as property manager since we were not living in the area. About two months later we received an email notifying us that an upstairs toilet had leaked but it had been handled and everything was dry. Since they had eyes on the situation we trusted them when the email said they had handled it and everything was dried. We had insurance, if they had informed us how bad the leak and water damage was we would have contacted them to come in. Instead two years later we have reports from an environmental mold specialist ongoing us that the upstairs and room beneath where water leaked is covered in black mold. Testing shows that it clearly originated from the bathroom leak not dealt with two years ago and the specialist also told us this does not happen when fans and dehumidifiers are brought in to properly dry everything out.\nWe owned a home in Virginia that had been handled by a property manager for 7 years before we could sell and they were always clear about communicating and honest with handling any issues. Haley was paid to do a job and clearly did not. My guess is because they knew we would not be extending our contract at the end of those four months when our sons moved in.

The size and location weren't bad for the price, and the one time pet fee made having a dog in college actually plausible. Unfortunately, that was pretty much all Hayley got right.\n\nThe yard was always a mess, with massive patches of dead grass and poor irrigation that caused the yard and our sidewalk to flood whenever it rained. There was also an issue where the owner of our property had requested that Hayley not sign anyone to a lease after our first lease ended so that he could sell the property, but Hayley signed us to a second lease anyway. This lead to confusion between us and the owner over whether we would be able to even live there the next year at a point in the year were most properties in town were already taken.\n\nHowever, the worst offense was their predatory security deposit handling. During our second lease, our new owners would visit often and always thanked us for taking such good care of the property. On moving out, we followed Hayley's checkout list in full and left the place better than we found it. Despite all this, instead of getting our security deposit back, we received a bill stating we owed $1600 in damages BEYOND what our security deposit covered.\n\nWe were surprised to hear this based on how we kept the property, so we requested proof of the damages we were being charged for from Hayley. We were told that we would have to schedule an appointment for that, but any subsequent attempts to schedule an appointment were ignored.\n\nFunnily enough, a friend in the same neighborhood who also rented from Hayley received a very similar bill upon moving out and has had the same experience in being ignored.\n\nIt seems as though Hayley's strategy is to scare young tenants out of their security deposits by asking for a ridiculous amount of money and then silently slinking off with an extra month's rent. To make things worse, this money isn't being used to clean or renovate the properties either, if the state of our property when we moved in is any indication.\n\nSo in summary, just avoid this company. Don't be fooled by the reviews here (if you look closely, almost all of the good reviews are years old with no comments and the recent reviews are much more scathing). You may not have problems right away, but they're bound to arise at some point.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

I lived under Hayley Management for 2 years. I enjoyed the property for the most part, but the office is very unorganized. Maintenance was also disrespectful to our belongings when they would come maintain the grass on the property. Grass was not cut as often as it should have been, multiple times it was knee high. They\u2019d consistently leave the gate open and throw our yard furniture near the house. The bushes in front of the house were probably trimmed twice the entire time that I lived there. If you cannot maintain all of your properties, maybe you should charge less for rent and not offer this service.\n\nMultiple times they called me saying I had not paid my rent when I had and even had a receipt to prove so. I was a very loyal resident who always paid my rent on time. The lease ended on the 20th of July and they would not offer us a pro-rate for the month. Although we had to pay the entire month\u2019s rent, we were required to keep water and power on 7 business days after moving out, and if we turned it off, then we were charged a $95 reconnecting fee. Aside from all of that, Their move out checklist is insane. They are trying to have the tenants clean the entire property so that they do not have to pay a cleaning service to do it. Tomorrow is 60 days since we moved out and our lease stated that after move out if applicable we would receive our security deposit and could request a list of damages.\n\nBack to being unorganized, no one in the office is able to provide me that list or amount that I am receiving back. I asked to speak to a manager and I spoke to Kurt who told me that this was a ridiculous question to ask. What's ridiculous is speaking to you clients like this. Is it really a ridiculous question to inquire about my money? Anyone who is leasing here or planning to lease here, be wary, because they make everything seem really nice in the beginning but really screw you over in the end.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

All their problems were my fault. They show absolutely no desire and put forward effort to make my rent payment easy to make, just threats. even after the check I wrote them was RETURNED TO ME DUE TO SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. Excuse my language but i didn't even know where the goddam office was. This is an inexpensive company that at the moment appears to care nothing at all about about the well being of their tenants. This is just a personal note, but I can give the impression of that of a low income person in trouble (when in reality that was not the case) and I get the impression that this company has been using the fear and threat of security as a means manipulate their \"less desirable\" clientele regularly for some time now. they seem very practiced. My advice, don't do business with people who use fear as a business model.

My daughter lived at this apartment complex for two years. When we got the house assignment before my daughter moved in they had completely changed the type house that my daughter had agreed to rent. Then they said directed me to the place in the least small print where it says they can switch you to any unit they please. There was nothing we could do about it. While we were in the unit the hot water heater was replaced going to a gas hot water heater and because the gas was in my name they charged the hot water heater to my account. It was charged to my gas account and debited out of my checking account, $1800 without my permission. I had to wait three months to be reimbursed and I also had to wait on a coupon from the gas company to be reimbursed. We could not wait to get out of there.\n\n\u2014\u2014I did receive a phone call a few days after posting my review from the corporate office about my negative review. I want to clarify that Spire didn\u2019t charge my account without the On-site management people at Creekside letting the gas company into the home. I nor my daughter was there to let them in and the only people that authorized the charge and transaction was Creekside and Creekside refused to call Spire and correct the problem by billing them or the owner of the condo. Also, the small print indicating they could and did switch the unit that we wanted is a fact and an issue that future tenants need to understand. It makes you realize that they could and did show a nice unit in the style, location, and price and switch you to whatever they want.

Some of it is good, some of it is bad, some of it could go either way depending on what you want out of a place to live, and some of it is just unavoidable as it is targeted to college students.\n\nSome aspects of the property are really nice. The clubhouse is pretty nice (though the weight room is a joke; I don't know why any Auburn student would use it instead of the top notch campus facility). The common areas are generally well-maintained. I say generally because while the landscaping is kept up, the gates are not. I've been trying to get my name added to the call box for three years and it still hasn't happened, yet I know residents that moved out years ago still in the list.  The gates are frequently broken and they keep nobody out. If someone wants to get in, they will get in. They will simply wait for someone to open the gate and go in after them. If you are going to be a \"gated community\" then be a gated community. In my opinion, Creekside should just get rid of the gates because they really don't accomplish anything except annoy the residents.\n\nCreekside does not tow. This could be good or bad depending on your point of view. I never had an issue with parking. On busy football weekends, perhaps I'd be 10-12 spots away from my front door but that was about the extent of it. However, other parts of the complex may not have quite as abundant parking so that could be an issue. I'm really not sure. It was nice to not have to deal with visitor passes, etc. but it would be very frustrating if there wasn't enough parking near your home.\n\nCreekside does not enforce many of its own rules. The one that really annoys me is the pool. It is supposed to be limited to residents and residents are allowed two guests I believe. What it ends up being is tons of people who might know one person in Creekside... or in some cases just show up without knowing anyone. I pay good money to live in a place like this and don't feel like my money should be going to clean up after non-residents who break chairs, leave beer cans and bottles strewn about, etc. Some would say I'm a party pooper... but I like to think of it as being irritated by trespassing. People (many times non-residents) bring beer bottles and dogs to the pool routinely... both are supposed to be fineable offenses... but I've never seen one handed out.\n\nMaintenance is a mixed bag, but mainly poor. To get a broken door repaired, it took about a dozen phone calls over a two month period. Simply absurd. I also reported a broken toilet two different times. Once, it was repaired promptly. The other time... I was told they'd be out there \"in the next couple of days\" and nobody ever came. After about a week, I fixed the toilet myself. Also, I should point out that *OWNERS* are occasionally treated as second-class citizens by the on-site management. Essentially, the homeowner's dues should get me the same rights as the renter's... but when I file a maintenance issue that is supposed to be covered by the HOA dues, they handle all renters first... I guess to make sure they get people to resign because they know the homeowner is unlikely to sell because of a small issue like this. Or, in the vast majority of cases, it isn't the actual homeowner who lives in the house; It is often the parent of one of the residents who probably never even hears about the issue.\n\nThe last issue I have is with the TV/Internet Service. It has been nothing short of awful the entire time I've lived here. In 2015, I don't think people can really appreciate just how bad I have had it and what a negative it is. The internet is slow, often less than 1 megabit/second so forget about streaming Netflix during peak hours; You'll be lucky if you can just get a YouTube video to play in 240p, nevermind HD.\n\nAll in all, it is a decent place to live. You could definitely do a lot worse. I think I'd rather pay for a location closer to campus rather than the resort style amenities, but that is personal preference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586452516041, "text": "Thank you for the valuable information"}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3710357e3:0xc8afc14b7cb32308"}

Oftentimes people who come to the pool don\u2019t even know anyone in the complex (I have no idea how they get in). Adding to their being unwelcome is the fact that they, along with actual residents, throw empty beer cans and cigarettes into the pool, making it disgusting and completely unable to be used.\n\nCreekside also advertises itself as a gated community. Unlike other gated complexes, however, Creekside uses a barcode scan system, which is usually broken. Thus the gates are open 24 hours a day, including weekends. If the gates are closed and the scanner is broken, there is no code to open the gates, which led to three broken gates because of cars driving through them in the year that I lived there. Why they chose a system with no backup way to get in is beyond me.\n\nCreekside is a magnet for irresponsible students who love to party loudly. I did not understand how there could be such a high concentration of people with such habits, but then I discovered that much of Creekside\u2019s advertising involves half of drink specials for residents and other alcoholic incitements. There were obnoxiously loud parties that could be heard two rows of houses over and up the street nearly every weekend and even on weekdays. These parties were rampant with underage drinking and lasted until four a.m. or later. The courtesy officer never picks up his phone, so the police usually come. This is an inconvenience and an annoyance for the officers, especially since Creekside hired someone who is supposedly responsible for taking care of such noise disturbances.\n\nThe Internet is abysmal, and it is nearly impossible to get someone to come out and fix it. Our Internet didn\u2019t work for three months, and the management refused to give us a refund on the portion of our rent that went toward cable and Internet.  They also refused to let us get our own router.\n\nManagement threatens to fine its residents constantly, but never follows up; therefore, what looks like a beautiful complex from outside the gates is full of porches that are littered with beer cans, cigarettes, trash, and beer pong tables. Any complaints about the state of the porches will go unnoticed.\n\nAll in all, Creekside is a place for rich kids whose parents don\u2019t care if they drink excessively underage and blow off classes in the morning due to a midweek party.

Wow, was that a mistake, especially this year. To call this place contractor grade cheap is a huge understatement.

I mostly think of my neighbors as roommates, because you can hear every single thing through what passes for walls.\n\nThe amenities seemed nice during the tour, but there's no way we're using any of those right now. A dog was something we considered, but after listening to the one down the hall from us that barks all evening, I don't know if we ever will now. There's so much dog hair in the hallway, it's like having tumbleweeds. The new floors are a big improvement over the gross carpet that lined the hallways, but they're already stained.

The one thing we did right was go for a pool view. The lights around the pool area are extremely bright, but they turn off eventually. The golf course view was tempting, but the noise from Clairmont Avenue would be so annoying I think. We've considered breaking our lease early even with the exorbitant cost (2 months rent). Maybe management would be flexible, but I really doubt it.\n\nI will say having a grocery store next door is very convenient and parking is never an issue. Maybe it'd be fine living here if you get lucky with the neighbors and can score a decent deal on the rent. We will be leaving at the end of our lease or maybe even earlier.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604960297825, "text": "Hi Rsimmons Sangria,\n\nI have not been able to find your name in our system but would love the opportunity to discuss any issues you are having.

The location is prime, most of the staff were wonderful and the scenery was just top notch. We made this home for roughly a year but just could not continue to justify such the expensive price tag that came with the seemingly small space - we bought a house and are much happier due to the issues that began to spiral once we began moving out.\n\nFor months we tried to get someone to our apartment to come and spray for pests that were coming from the apartments of people who loved to leave their trash by their front doors on none trash days - we even witnessed people putting their take out containers on the floors in the hallways, making the entire hallway smell like dead animals - it was bad. The floors of the apartments are made out of a very cheap material so its very easy to scratch and scuff, especially if you have dogs like we did. The walls were so thin you could literally hear the conversations of the tenant in the next apartment. There were times we had neighbors that would play their music at 3 in the morning and since the walls were so thin, we sadly heard it all and had to endure it. The trash valet service was a joke - never met such picky trash people in my life. The service, luckily, was switched just a few days before we moved out - praying that the current tenants are getting better service for the money they pay every month.\n\nUpon moving out, we were not given an exit survey like most apartments do to check off on any damages within the apartment. Luckily we took pictures of every inch of the apartment before leaving. We were sent a bill of almost $1500 in damages to the apartment (floors, fridge, anything not tied down) - all were just wear and tear on the walls from pictures and the carpet which was not damaged at all. We were told we needed to pay to replace everything which was outrageous. There was no way possible two young professional adults ruined an apartment in the ways they claimed. We tried to heavily communicate with management but responses were far and few between. It took us weeks to even reach someone so they could reply to our inquiries about the damages. It took so long to reach someone that the bill was sent to collections after we explicitly tried to handle the misunderstanding with no help from management. We were luckily able to get this ordeal handled promptly and efficiently with the collections company which were far more easier to deal with than Park 35.\n\nIf you love living in a high dollar box I would definitely recommend Park 35. Just be prepared to stay there forever if you want to be treated as a valued tenant - the dynamic of the staff completely changes once you inform them that you will not be renewing.\n\nPros:\nLocation - you are near night life and numerous eateries\nGrounds of the complex were 'usually' kept clean\nMs. Teria, before she left\nDog park and grooming station\n\nCons:\nPests\nPaper thin walls\nPet owners never picking up behind pets\nCheaply made apartments\nTalladega Speedway Parking Deck\nInconsiderate neighbors", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1556938609832, "text": "Thank you very much for your review.

And to discover why it's named as it is, just wait for the winter view from atop the ridge. It's lovely!\n\nBy far, though, its most sellable feature is the quality of management. It is managed by its owners, and not by an employee of a distant corporation, as I've often found in other places. This means that detailed attention is given to the condition of the buildings and grounds on a constant basis, repairs and unexpected emergencies are handled with speed and competence, and the owners are on site almost daily.  The Owner\u2019s long experience with building construction and landscaping shows in the good repair of the buildings and the beauty of the grounds, contributing immensely to the livability and quality of life of the tenants. And the high integrity and professionalism with which she conducts business is deeply appreciated by those of us who've had less than stellar experiences with some other rentals.\n\nIn summary, not only will one get living space kept in good repair and in well-tended, lovely surroundings at The View, but one will get extremely ethical, competent and responsive management.

I mean informally instead of by the standard lease renewal process.  Gateway (owners) soon to be former owners, do not care to assist you or respond to you. They will never work with you in a crisis.  They will evict you over an unproven allegation of prohibited conduct without hesitation.  Even if no non payment of rent happens.  Every other Property Manager was great.  This unprofessional Landlord went into unit without the proper notice and when no one was home. Refused to repair damages to unit from Hurricane Sally.  Harassed tenants with multiple notices on door.  They charge the highest fee to use the online payment portal.  We could not and would not ever recommend to any person Jasmine Trails Apartments.  Property Owners Gateway is substandard.  Former tenant.  Happy to be former resident. Gateway's bad decision to back such unprofessional mess as manager will reflect their future.

They seem nice, but in actuality when they have to deal with a serious matter, they could care less about the tenants convenience. Then they have the audacity to raise the rent every year claiming that it's the \"market value\" price, but not providing \"market value\" service & apartments. I had an incident happen 1/1/17 where my apartment was shot into by a ricocheted bullet. It came thru my sliding glass door. It took maintenance 3 days to fix it. I had to leave the apartment during that time, its was a mess. On 3/13/17, they finally fixed the bullet hole in my wall where the bullet was lodged within. That is unacceptable. Also, the schools in the area are not that great either. I am currently now finding somewhere else to stay. This is an o.k. place for someone, living alone, who's just starting out but if you have children, a spouse, etc. these are NOT the apartments for you!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a982f4edbf9:0x54c1bf66c2ec0508"}

This includes paying all Association bills, working with and overseeing vendors, answering Owner, Realtor, lender, and closing attorney questions, creating financials statements, reconciling the bank accounts, administering quarterly and annual meetings, etc.  The annual budget is set by the Board of Directors and is then presented to all Owners to vote to ratify at the Annual Members Meeting.

We cannot speak to how the Association was operated previously, but a primary reason we are hired is to provide covenant enforcement for Associations.  If someone is considering purchasing a home in an Association we manage, they can expect an Association that operates within the budget set by the Board of Directors and ratified by the Members.  They can also expect the restrictive covenants to be enforced in a fair and compassionate way.  We always send a friendly letter for each first time violation to make the owner aware of the covenant violation and provide a timeframe to correct the violation.  This friendly letter results in 95 percent of the violations being corrected.  In the cases where the violation is not corrected, we do have a set policy that is equally enforced to bring the property into compliance.  The majority of violation letters we send are a result of a neighbor reporting the violation to us for enforcement.  By having a set system, it allows neighbors to be neighbors without having to get into demanding compliance with restrictive covenants.  We facilitate that process for the Board and neighbors.

I tried to call several times, never get answered. I also emailed, no answer as well. They are doing a fair job at maintenance.\nAnother thing that happened when I moved out was all the UHauls were gone during that week, so I asked the main office if I could have a grace period for one day. The premise for me to ask this was my roommate is still leasing the apartment, and she has not found the new roommate yet. I assumed, if she agrees, then I should be good. I went to talk to the main office, the front desk told me to talk to the office at the Midtown apartment. I went there, the lady rejected my proposal and said they will have vendors checking my room right on the day I moved out and through my stuff out even if I have my roommate's permission to place them in the living room. So, I ran crazy for that week looking for moving trucks and finally moved out on time (actually two days in advance). I returned the keys and everything to the main office and told my story. Another lady, seems like the manager or some management-level person told me a totally different answer. She said if my roommate is keeping renting the apartment and agree to let me put my stuff in there, I could have the grace period!!! This is nuts! I was so upset for that day but decided to not give a bad review on Google review. This time, I really cannot. It is not about money, it is their attitude.\n\nUpdated\n\nAround an hour than I left the one star review, they responded and someone finally answered the call. The answer I got for the charge is because of the wreath we had on the door\ud83d\ude44\ufe0fso I told them that is not trash, that is what we used to place outside as decoration. Since my roommate is still living in there, it should not count as something I left not as trash. The new manager of the office said she had no other answer for my question other than I have to pay the \u201creasonable\u201d charge. Oh, the most incredible thing for this management company is they will change the detail of the lease without notifying. Since I am moving out of the town and my roommate will stay, she renewed the lease. When we started to lease the apartment, we get told that we are only leasing our own room (we were paired up by the management company), which means we do not have to lease the whole apartment if we cannot find a roommate. After two years of leasing, our contract have never changed. However, they changed it this year without any notification, and my roommate did not look through carefully so she rent the whole apartment. This is the reason why I thought I should be ok to leave my stuff in the apartment with my roommate\u2019s permission. Based on my roommate\u2019s feedback, their maintainance worked as well as the office does.

I was called the \u201cN\u201d word by a random person and mentioned it to the leasing consultant.  I wasn\u2019t ask any questions regarding who that person could be. No description. No concern to even figure out if that person was a resident or not to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else. I didnt expect much but I definitely expected some sort of concern. And I didn\u2019t hear from the manager until a WEEK after I mentioned it. It took me having to email her for her to reach out to me.\n\nWith the many problems from having the dishwasher, lighting, and garbage disposal fixed, the garbage inside and outside, it\u2019s the noisiest place to live, my fridge doesn\u2019t even dispense clean water (it\u2019s very cloudy and grey),  I didn\u2019t even realized I was paying for valet parking just to have my car parked in the open where it can still be broken into.\n\nThe property manager has been horrible with communication. This place doesn\u2019t care at all about their tenants. I\u2019m never one to write a bad review but this is just unacceptable. I will be ending my lease after only being there for less than a month.\n\nMy experience hasn\u2019t been good from the start.

I love living at the Thomas Jefferson Tower. I moved in 2 months ago; I have had some minor issues which required scheduling maintenance to visit my apartment but the guys have been great. Our property manager, Paris Topazi, has been attentive to my questions/concerns and always replies. Sometimes the repair issues have taken a little patience on my behalf because a part is unavailable and needs ordering. A building of this size and complexity must require a lot of details and upkeep, so I've no complaints. My love for the history and architecture of the building, as well as personally witnessing the rebirth of Birmingham, influenced me to make the decision to move here and be a part of the revitilization in the downtown area. I don't have to worry about traffic (I can reach the parking deck where I work in 5 minutes) and I save car fuel. I am close to Railroad Park, Pizitz Food Hall, and amazing restaurants such as Brick and Tin, Trattoria Zaza, El Barrio, The Essential, Paramount, Revelator Coffee and many more places that I intend on discovering for the fun and pleasure of it. I don't even have to walk outside of the building to visit one of the classiest restaurants in the city: Roots and Revelry. The food is amazing and the crew is attentive to your every need and want.\n\nDown the street is the Harvest Market for delicious food and groceries, and in the Thomas Jefferson, we have our own convenience store, the Vineyard Market, which stocks many items you might need in a pinch.\n\nFrom my window I can look out and see reminders of history everywhere: the Civil Rights Museum, 16th Street Baptist Church, Carver Theater, the 4th Avenue Business District and the Colored Masonic Temple where Duke Ellington and Count Basie performed, and Martin Luther King met with officials. From my bedroom window I can see the Lyric Theater, as well as the Alabama Theater. There are churches within walking distance of my apartment. There is so much potential here for beauty, art, music and architecture. I walk around to study the old structures that line the streets and I dream of a future where they will all be lovingly restored with businesses and residences.\n\nAs a child of the 60's, it is very important to me that Birmingham is revitalized to become a positive example of unity and brotherhood, where all walks of life can coexist. Birmingham's past is stained by racism that has left scars, but why can't it become a place that is not strictly gentrified but a place where people of all walks of life can afford to live? I don't think that is a dream that is out of reach. But it takes patience. The City is working with many different groups to bring change to Downtown.\n\nI'm  aware that my lengthy review has evolved beyond simply stating my opinions about living at Thomas Jefferson Tower; it has become a dissertation of life in the city while singing its praises.That is because TJ Tower is such a part of the history of Birmingham. It is interlinked to the other historic places around its perimeter and part of Birmingham's historic skyline. To live here is to appreciate the history and richness of the past, as well as its lessons.\n\nI sometimes imagine the halls of this grand structure echoing with the noises of hotel life long ago. Celebrities and dignitaries visited here, as well as average, every day people like you and me. Can you imagine the many stories that this building must hold within its walls, beginning in the grand lobby and all the way up to the 20th floor? For decades this place stood empty, solid yet forlorn, waiting for people with vision to see beauty beneath its stained exterior. I admire that kind of ambition. Now it is open again and will be made even better for future generations. Birmingham is being renewed, too, and I hope I live long enough to see its stained past outshone by healing and renewal.

While I was out of town for Thanksgiving, my vehicle, along with six others (according to the police), was broken into in the Thomas Jefferson Tower parking lot, for which I pay $150/month to park (an amount that exceeds any other parking fee I have seen in Birmingham, particularly for an unpaved and unfenced lot). The break in was reported to the Thomas Jefferson Tower valet and to the police on Friday, November 23 by a fellow tenant. I was not informed by anyone at the Thomas Jefferson Tower that my window had been smashed open, so my belongings were left vulnerable until I flew home and discovered it myself on Sunday, November 25. The same was true for at least two of the other vehicles that were broken into. My vehicle sat in their parking lot for two-days while it was rained on, damaging the upholstery and electronics, and inviting anyone who wished to come take my belongings to do so. The damage to my upholstery and window electronics was caused directly by the fact that I was not informed of the break in. The same thing happened to other tenants last week over Christmas. I have been told by staff that the management has not introduced any new security or surveillance measures. I would not recommend the Thomas Jefferson Tower to anyone.\n\nUPDATE: Since making this post, no security or safety measures have been taken by property management and at least 2 other break ins have occurred to around 17 other vehicles. They only warned other tenants of the danger after the most recent vehicles were broken into.

The gym was often dirty and provided no disinfectant spray or paper towels. I notified the office and they cleaned the gym and provided supplies, but within a couple of weeks the gym was dirty again and out of supplies. As a result, I started going to another gym. On another occasion, I was having recurring noise problems from a neighbor. I contacted the office four times about this issue and they did not do anything about it until I was able to email them a video of how loud the noise was. Lastly, in the middle of my lease, the business started using a new payment system that charges the residents almost $20 as a \u201cservice fee\u201d to simply pay their bill. The worst part about this was that The Beacon did not tell the residents about this new policy. It was up to the residents to figure it out.

But from August this year(2020), The Beacon started to use Simplebills and it would mandatory charge a \u201cmonthly fee\u201d for no reason. It seems like If I don\u2019t creat an account of Simplebills, I can\u2019t get my new parking permit card. I went to the office and asked once, the manager just seems like didn\u2019t want to solve it(monthly fee) seriously, and just told me to call the Simplebills\u2019s service people. Before went to the office, I emailed them twice to ask about the \u201cmonthly fee\u201d, but got no reply. I was very disappointed. For now I still will be charged a \u201cmonthly fee\u201d every month.\nAnd the most important thing is that the microwave in my apartment doesn\u2019t work for over three months, the maintenance staff came to fix it twice but still doesn\u2019t work.

Since I\u2019ve started living they\u2019ve had 3 different general managers. Their assistant manager left so they went without one from November until April. This property is completely unorganized. Once one general manager leaves they don\u2019t leave hardly any notes for the new general managaer to work off of. I had a terrible roommate for most of this time. She was breaking the lease and I brought it to their attention and they didn\u2019t want to handle it. The last general manager Angel was awesome. She handled everything exactly how it should be. The new general manager April is amazing also. She handles everything in a timely manner and makes you feel like she cares and actually listens to you. Some of the community assistants are fantastic but others aren\u2019t. Luke is amazing and will treat you with kindness and respect no matter what. He\u2019s always super nice and very willing to do whatever he can do to help you. There is a community assistant who is very rude and isn\u2019t very helpful. This person was nice at first when I got my tour but when this person was handling the issues I would have they would tell me that they would get back to me on a certain day and wouldn\u2019t. I would have to reach back out to this person to get them to fix whatever issue was present. This person also refused to let my stepmother talk to a manager. This person left my stepmother on multiple holds to talk to the manager when this person should\u2019ve let my stepmother (who\u2019s name is on the lease) talk to the manager herself like she asked to. This person also doesn\u2019t really make an effort to listen to you or show that they care in any capacity. Very cold individual and very emotionless. I wouldn\u2019t live at this property ever again unless they cleared out all office staff except for a few individuals like Luke, April, and a couple of other community assistants who\u2019ve actually been helpful and kind. The maintenance staff is impeccable. The 2 men I\u2019ve worked with in the past have been wonderful and awesome. One of the men had to come to my apartment at around 10PM for an emergency and I never felt uncomfortable or wary of him being in my apartment  late because he is super kind, respectful, and will get the job done and do it well! The older man who is on the maintenance crew is also super kind and helpful... he\u2019s never come into my apartment to do any maintenance while I was home but he did when I wasn\u2019t there and he did an amazing job and got my new washer/dryer in super quickly, locked my door back, and didn\u2019t leave a mess!! If you plan on living at this community with someone you know well and won\u2019t have issues with and don\u2019t need to go to the office for anything you will be good but if not I do not reccomend living here. I\u2019m moving in August and I\u2019m disappointed because I like and appreciate so many members of the staff there but a couple of rude employees will ruin your experience especially if you have issues with anything big. But I do have a feeling that April is here to stay and she is a wonderful general manager so you might could get her help instead of a couple of the rude community assistants. Rooms are small. Bathrooms are gross. The lining between the bottom of my bathtub and floor was coming off when I moved in. There was dead bugs in my room when I moved in. There are paint brush strokes on the granite and on the white baseboards and also on the floors. The desk was stained with some white stuff. The grout in the shower was dirty. The kitchen was disgusting. Living room is a nice size. The kitchen is tiny. Not enough space for anymore than 2 people to live happily in one of these apartments. I lived in a 3 bedroom and we were constantly all over each other. There simply isn\u2019t enough space in the kitchen for 3 people and all their food. The pantry is also too small. Hardly any storage space. The bottom of the cabinet under the sink is rotting because of a water leak and has been that way since I moved in. It smells absolutely disgusting.

I have never called the police on any one, I have never identified someone for the police, and I have never filed a formal complaint against a person. Normally I would not respond to a review, but since you have explicitly mentioned my name on such a public forum, claiming that I was the cause of such a horrid event, I wanted a chance to rectify my name. Again, I am not claiming that this event did not occur, but I want to make it clear that I was never apart of it.\n\nThank you,\n\nBrandon Ray", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

HONESTLY, I would not live here unless it is a last resort. The prices they are asking people to pay, considering the size and age of the apartments here, is absolutely ludicrous. Maintenance is decent, but sometimes the delays result from things the management can't help (i.e. waiting for parts from an outside source, requiring contractors, etc.). Management isn't the best and will absolutely do their best to screw you. (I.E. I renewed for an unfurnished apartment - the new management told me they were going to put furniture of their own in the apartment. I e-mailed and told them that I had signed for an unfurnished apartment so I would not allow any of their furniture into the apartment (because of pets). Amber, the GM, e-mailed and said that nowhere in my lease specified that I had an unfurnished apartment. She said this because she wasn't aware that I had a copy of the lease which clearly displayed an X beside an unfurnished lease.) I sincerely recommend ANYWHERE else to live because the cost and headache of the management just isn't worth it. My water bill for one month was $80, another was $60 and they are still working on reimbursing me. (The water bill is split between the four people, so there is no way we racked up a $320 water bill).  They have a record of losing payments, and charging late fees because management was too lazy to process the payments on time. I implore you not to live here. Their computer lab printer HARDLY ever works, and they've decided to start making residents supply their own paper.

Also, I had to pay $100 each month for a \"short term lease\", but I kind of understand that because they probably can't rent the apartment during the year again.\nThe only thing I had a lot of problems was the electric bill: I only charged my tablet and my phone, while my roommates were always on the playstation and the computer, were listening to music through a big stereo and their TVs were always on. The Beacon doesn't charge the power directly, in every room somebody has to sign up at Alabama Power. Of course, my roommates wanted to split the bill even (which already brought a lot of discussions)... And one roommate just left in the middle of the semester without saying anything and, of course, without paying the electric bill. In the end, Alabama Power cutted off our power and I had no choice but to pay a lot of the others' power.....

The management is very helpful and maintenance is very good at getting to your request within a few days. The pool is nice but could use to be cleaned more. The exercise room is nice but needs more treadmills because one of them is either broken or always in use. The tanning bed is awesome and they are even nice enough to provide goggles if you need them. The only negative thing about this apartment is the card keys you use instead of regular door keys. You might think it's great at first, but trust me, you'll grow to hate them by the end. You can't just close your door to walk your dog without your card. If you forget your card, you have to get a lock out key and if the office is closed, you have to call the after hours number and it can take a while for someone to get back to you about a lockout. I wish I could have a normal lock on my door with a normal key. It's nice to have a tiger transit and we are the second stop which is great because it can fill up in the mornings and you don't want to have to be standing on your way to campus.

Management randomly decided to change all the locks on the bedroom doors and they expected you to come get your new key on their terms. They left one note in the door saying it would be done the next week but didn't tell you what day your apartment was going to be changed and expected you to pick up your key that day during business hours. I work out of town a lot and didn't come home sometimes for a couple days at a time and got home very late sometimes so I didn't even see the notice until the day before this was done. There was no email or phone call (even though they made sure to call/email me at least 4 times a week asking if I wanted to renew my freaking lease.) So I call the office, from out of town, the day the lock is changed and told them that I wouldn't be home before the office closed and tried to see if I could get my key given to my roommate (who works in the office and I've lived with for 6 years, so I trust) or maybe get it put in the mailbox. They wouldn't let me do anything and I left several messages for the manager who refused to call me back. Finally after calling over and over again I get the manager, Amber, on the phone and she tells me that I can call the on call number when I get home that night and pay the $50 fee to get let into my room. So you mean to tell me that I pay $555 to rent this room and because you decided you want to randomly change the locks for no reason I now have to pay $50 more for you to let me in? I don't think so. After arguing with Amber about not paying the fee she finally agreed to let me sign a piece of paper stating that I consented to let her leave my bedroom door unlocked and she would personally do the change so she would make sure to leave it unlocked and I would just have to pick up the new key the next day. I wrote it up and emailed it to her immediately after getting off the phone with her and she confirmed that it was received. Fast forward to later that night, I get home and the damn door is LOCKED.  I also tried to call the parent company to speak with someone higher up about this issue while not being able to get in touch with Amber all day and the receptionist there told me \"she didn't know what I wanted her to do about it, she was getting off in 15 minutes\" then after telling her that she needed to do SOMETHING about it TODAY, she said she would have someone call me and I never heard from anyone from there again, so don't even bother trying to go higher up.

Pet friendly\n\nBad things:\nThe apartments are VERY small, good luck fitting a bed larger than a full in the rooms. Whoever manages this property doesn't care too much about making sure the units are kept up. You can tell each year when they repaint the walls they just paint over the plug plates instead of removing them. As a result you can't use every plug because it'll be too caked in paint for the plug to fit. There is also painting drippings around the border of the room, from them not putting anything down to cover the carpet before painting. This wouldn't be an issue, but the carpets are a brown/black fabric so the white spots stand out like a chocolate sprinkle on vanilla ice cream.The appliances are old. The kitchen is literally stuffed in a corner, and the counter space is awful. If you have a microwave on the counter good luck fitting much else. Pest control, if they even come, must use water when they spray because you will have bugs!!! They'll come from everywhere, the windows, the shower, the sink, wherever! So if you don't like bugs I'd suggest finding another place to live. They recently painted the buildings and claim to have renovated the apartments, this isn't true. All they did was put in new mattresses and living room furniture. The walls are paper thin....so thin I can hear my roommate snoring in the next room. And if you have someone above, forget everyday being peaceful and quiet. They could be walking from the kitchen to their bedroom and it'll sound like a herd of cattle are moving around above you. Not only are the units noisy for lack of insulation, this place is like the party spot. So if you like to spend your nights studying at home, you might as well hang it up here. Someone will always be partying, riding around with loud music, yelling, whatever. But at the same time this can be expected from a lot of living places in a college town.\n\nI lived here very briefly and moved on to somewhere nicer and quieter. I would never live there again, you couldn't pay me to live there again. In all I'd look around for somewhere else to live, and come here only as a last resort.\nHope this helps!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

There's a Tiger Transit stop, and it only takes about 15 minutes to get to class, so it doesn't get much better than that. Other than that, the apartment you'll be living in is nothing like the model they show you. It's pretty much luck of the draw: I got one of the nicer apartments where mostly everything worked, but my boyfriend's apartment had the linoleum coming up in the bathroom and mushrooms growing out of his bathroom wall because of the mold. Management does not care about fixing any damages; in one apartment, the crown molding had been scratched off because of a past resident's dog, but all they did was paint over it. The space you're getting is nice, but be prepared for something to break, and I've had instances where my roommate and I both put in over 5 maintenance requests for just one issue before they came to fix it, and we've even had to call the office. Walls are paper thin, and you can hear your neighbor's conversations through the walls; you can even hear the person above you using the bathroom. The place uses key cards, like a hotel, instead of actual keys, which seems cool at first but eventually, it's a nightmare. You'll lose them, or they'll break, in which case you're charged money for a new one. God forbid the front office is closed because the person who is on call to come and help you usually takes a long time and seems more bothered than anything that you called. As a resident, I've had my car towed before (even though there was a parking permit in my car), and I had to pay $100 to get it back, but the office didn't seem to care. People who don't even live at the complex come here to throw parties or use the pool, and once again, the office doesn't check or care. I've seen bunches of young children in the pool during the summer who I know are not college students living here. Parties are constantly being thrown after hours, but the person on call seems more annoyed that they're being bothered to do their job, so the police usually end up getting called. Amenities are pretty cool, and there are always fun events being had for residents, but the printer in the computer lab, never, EVER works, and even if it does, there are residents who use the computers in the front office to watch movies, listen to loud music, or play games for days on end, and nothing is ever done about it.

The whole process was horrible because you would ask the employees questions and they never had the answer and during the weekend the manager was not there at least when I called. During this awful process I still kept going with the process. Fast forward to Monday I have spoken with that office over 10xs. I receive a call from Taylor saying everything was good to go and I can move in Tuesday 4/25/17 and I would just have to bring payment of 102.00. I was excited despite the issues with the process. I packed my car that night and was handing off my key today Tuesday 4/25/17 to my old place. Amber the General manager sends me an application for my son and I fill it out. I then arrive at the beacon with the money order ready to bring my stuff upstairs since I was already told I could move in. Amber then tells me since my Son is 13 months which still means he is a 1 yr. old I can not move in after yesterday I was told everything was approved and I could move in. Now I have my car packed with no where to go so Now I am homeless with a one year old. I have to spend money at a hotel so my son can have somewhere to sleep after the beacon told me I can move in and then takes it back.

At first glance the facility is well maintained and there was some upgrading going on the last time I was there, thats a positive. The negative I experienced was with  an individual who should have been representing the facility but instead discredited it. As a good father should I was loading my daughters furniture on my trailer to get her moved out of her apartment on 28 Jul 2016. While fastening the cargo down I saw a golf cart pull up behind me and a short round heavy set young man rolled off the cart and started running his mouth about something as he headed into the buildings breezeway. He stopped short of the building and started saying somethingto the effect of \"I bet your having a better day today then you did the other nite\" and\" I'll make sure you dont ever get the chance to,\" l continued with securing the load. I then asked my daughter what was that guy talking about and why was he taunting her. She said he lived above her and it was something that happened 2 or 3 nights earlier, I then asked is he a resident or does he work there, she said both. I told her if it wasnt for her moving out I would file a complaint with the office. It was as if he was trying to start a confrontation but let it be known he was in charge. He came out of the 2nd floor apartment headed towards the golf cart, mumbled something else, but before he could leave another young man standing on a scaffold at the building next to hers. He went back to the cart and left, a minute or so later my daughter and her friend left in her car and was behind them in my truck w/trailer. As I headed out of the complex an Auburn police vehicle was heading in. I stopped and waved the officer to pass in front of me, he waved back and continued. I got on College headed towards I-85 and was pulled over, questioned about making threats against an employee at the complex, told I was identified as the one that made the threats, my truck was identified as the vehicle that was involved, forced to stand outside of my vehicle while another officer went and got Mr Brandon Ray, the accuser, so he could identify me. Well long and longer story shortened, Mr Ray in his haste to re-inflate a situation from 2-3 nites earlier decided to call the police and put a new flame on a already extinguished iincident,  ironically against a wrong person. Not to mention that whatever had happened earlier was taken care of by the authorities nites earlier, the proper authorities !!! The whole thing was sorted out, the police explained the misunderstandings I said I understood however it was totally unnecessary, we shook hands and went our seperate ways. However, in my 90 minutes of unnecessary detainment and somewhat mild harassment I decided that Mr Ray should learn from the error in his ways. It was the \"right thing to do\" to use local law enforcement to handle non conforming residents or guests of residents a few nites earlier for whatever reason. When you represent a multi million dollar apartment complex always be a part of the solution and not the problem. It is the \"right thing to do\" to exercise the authorities to uphold and maintain rules and regulations of the property you work for and represent. It is \"not the right thing to do\" to taunt or badger residents or guests for any reason. It is \"not the right thing to do\" when you attempt to recreate a bad incident so you can change or control the outcome !!! I sincerely hope the owners of this complex takes a hard look at the many many negative things written in the reviews about the management team of the The Beacon. I hope they get proactive and make some necessary changes. I would not recommend spending money here until so. I would also recommend that if Mr Ray is going to continue working for them, he take some courses on professionalism, stay off that golf cart and do some walking. This will allow him to become better at dealing with the people who pay his wages.\nThis was my experience and my opinion.\nThanks, Contributing parent of the class 2017 & 2019", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

My family and I moved from a large neighborhood with an expensive mortgage to Peppertree Apartments over five years ago.  Our intent was to \"downsize\" in order to afford to put our two kids through college, debt free.  What a great idea!\nOur expenses at Peppertree Apartments are less than half of what we were paying, and we don't have to mow the grass, clean the pool, or keep up with any of the outside chores we used to have when we were homeowners!  Apartment life DOES have its advantages!\nThe complex has changed ownership 3 times since we first lived here, and currently it is run by a staff that really cares about their clients.  Our packages are received in the rental office and stored until we can pick them up.  Maintenance issues are usually handled within 24 hours.  Major repairs are taken care of --- or else the unit or appliance is replaced.\nPets are welcome, but management requires them to be on a leash when outside.  Neighbors get to know each other.  The staff throws occasional parties to encourage social interaction with new and old neighbors alike!\nAll in all, I recommend Peppertree Apartments for the 1) friendly staff, 2) prompt attention to maintenance and safety; and 3) the AWESOME convenience to everything in the Peppertree/Sturbridge area.  EastChase is just minutes away.  You can walk to the Walmart Neighborhood Market or several restaurants nearby.  Most of the stores are \"pet friendly,\" so you have no excuse not to walk your pooch!\nKids are always having fun playing, neighbors watch out for their safety, the tennis court is newly renovated, and the living is easy.

Unfortunately, things changed.  Maintenance orders do not get repaired-when I was finally able to reach someone in the office to ask about my 3+ week old maintenance order the response was \"oh, we don't check those messages.\"  I received two warnings for throwing cigarette butts on the ground; when I said \"I don't smoke I think those butts are my downstairs neighbors (who did smoke) the response was \"don't you live upstairs?\"  When I said yes I was told \"then they are your butts.\"  When I turned in my notice, I was sent a letter listing the things I needed to do prior to move out and to get my security deposit returned.  Three weeks after sending me the letter confirming they had received my notice the office manager told the new company I was trying to lease from that I had not given a notice; Peppertree was not aware I planned on moving.  The day I signed my lease with Peppertree I paid a $300.00 pet fee, provided a picture of my pet, and provided my pets vet records.  When my new landlord called for a reference he was told Peppertree did not know I had a pet.  It has now been four months since I moved from Peppertree; I have called eight times to ask about my security deposit.  Eight times I have been told \"the manager is at lunch I will have her call you back.\"  I finally sent an email to the management company.  After sending the email, the Peppertree manager did call me; she told me they did owe me my security deposit and a check would be cut on July 17 or 24th.  Well, it is now August 3rd and no check.  I called today and the manager told me \"the cycle of checks for July 24th were not cut.  I'll call you by the end of the day to let you know when you can expect your check.\"  Unfortunately a place that started out so great turned into a nightmare.

The number one concern we have had is outside of our building the ground stays flooded, even when it has not rained which may be part of the water damage we have had. When we moved into the apartment there was water damage all around the windows in the living room, my husband contacted the office and they sent someone out to \"take care\" of the issue, when we came back to the apartment they had just painted over the water damage. We had water damage under the kitchen sink which we reported to the front office, they sent someone out a few weeks later to replace the wood. We later found out that the reason the wood under the since had water damage was due to the dishwasher was flooding the kitchen, when we called about that issue it took weeks to have someone come look at it and then a few more weeks for the dishwasher to be replaced. For several months our outside lights did not work, we have had roaches since we moved in, after reporting that several times the pest control people came out and I was told that what they spray when they come out would do nothing for the roaches we had and they were not even aware we had roaches or they could have used other solutions to get rid of them. The guest bathroom toilet has broken several times and they finally after 6 weeks they came out and just super glued the piece back together.

It will get broken, they will do nothing for weeks, it will finally get fixed, get broken again a day or two later due to how flimsy the gate arms are, and then it will stay that way for another few weeks.

I waited onsite for another 45 minutes and no one ever returned to the office or answered my ticket. THREE days later I get a phone call from the apartment complex stating they would love to schedule another tour.

If that was the case you think they would have a record and could definitely say why they were out.\n\nI can understand only one person working and being out on a tour that ran late, or maybe even property management issues.

Maintenance techs come into your apartment whenever, even if they have told you a certain date and time. When it was time for me to move out, I made sure to clean and vacuum. It was as clean as it was when I initially moved in, but because it wasn\u2019t spotless we are being charged enough to keep my security deposit and more.

I called the number and I was directed the call center and made an appointment. My friend and I sat outside for 45 minutes before someone came back. When Fredricka returned to the office, she was off the rip rude. I was washing my hands at the sink and I guess that is frowned upon at the Haven apartment complex.\nWhen my friend was explaining the purpose of her visit, Ms. Fredricka was not comprehending anything she was saying. Before viewing the apartments, I gave a suggestion to Ms. Fredricka that she should turn the sign around so people can know she is not in the office at the moment. She explained to me that she didn\u2019t turn it around because she was just getting her lunch. Although she was just getting food and not handling business pertaining to the apartments, she should have still turned the sign around so others can know that she is not in the office.\nWe went and viewed the renovated version of the Madison and it was beautiful. One thing that I might add is that the description of the \u201cpatio\u201d should be worded and explained as a balcony because that\u2019s exactly what it is. The bedrooms in this particular unit is not big enough for the price of rent.  Upon our return to the office to view the other unit, there were people standing outside because once again, the sign was not turned around to inform them that she was on a tour. We went to view the classic version of the Hamilton and how Ms. Fredricka explained this unit is not how I envisioned it. This apartment has cream counter tops and appliances and it is not appealing to the eye at all. The cream appliances and grey cabinets make the apartment look real country. The fridge had rust on the side and I asked Ms. Fredricka if they would replace or paint over this rust stain on the refrigerator should my friend move into this unit. Maybe she did not see nor comprehend what I was saying because she said that this apartment comes with cream countertops and appliances. That\u2019s clearly not what I was asking her. I asked the question again and she seemed perplexed as if I was asking if she personally would replace the refrigerator. When she finally comprehended what I was saying, she explained that no one has ever asked that question but she would have to check into that and see. This whole experience, completely turned my friend and I off from ever thinking about renting apartments from here. I gave it two stars because the first unit we viewed and the property itself is very beautiful.

It was my understanding in the lease I signed that I was responsible for the water that \u201cI\u201d used. I was told to reach out to American Utility Management (AUM) for further assistance. After doing so, AUM said that it seems like there has been a substantial amount of water being used throughout the complex lately, which makes sense due to the major sewage and water leakage issues and construction that\u2019s been occurring for the past month or so, which adds to the water/sewage usage. Sounds like they\u2019re overcharging us so they can cover the cost of the sewage issues that we don\u2019t have anything to do with.

And she was so nice. She took time out with us, told us all about the complex, pricing (625 for a 1 bedroom 715 for a 2 bedroom etc), how their process goes etc. When left we felt great and was looking forward to becoming a resident.\nWe originally made arrangements to come and do all of the paperwork on monday but couldn't make it that day due to personal issues. But we called and notified the assistant that we spoke with that we would be in on friday. (Today Nov. 16, 2018 ) well when we gets there on friday(today) the assistant property manager appeared as if she didnt know who we were at first. But as we got closer she recognized us. And offered us to come into her office, have a seat, and began to telling us that the apartment we were looking at last week has been given away to someone else that they felt was more qualified for it than us. And she had this other apartment coming up that was near the woods. And then she began telling us that the rent price would no long be 625 now the price is going to be 725 for a one bedroom. She never says how much more the deposit was going to be. But she informed us that since last week that we spoke with her a new tenant has come and grabbed the other apartment we were looking at, and changes to the rules had been made. Now they want you to meet 3 times the rent to qualify( in which that was something she never meantioned last week) plus she stated that the rent was going up 100 bucks because THE OWNER is wanting to do upgrades.  To the carpet, and the floors, and paint the cabinets, etc. Showed us a sample of what type of carpet it would be, plus the type of new flooring for the kitchen and laundry and bath...I really wasnt impressed with it. She seemed like she was rushing. Trying to hurry us out of there. Unlike the way she acted last week which was very kind, warm. Welcoming, patient, talkative\nShe then grabbed some income info and calculated that the amount of income would not be enough to qualify to be a resident at their complex. THIS IS SOMETHING SHE ALSO COULD HAVE DONE LAST WEEK WHEN WE WERE HERE RATHER THAN HAVE US COMING BACK ONLY TO BE TOLD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT RENT PRICE ALONG WITH TELLING US THAT WE HAD TO MAKE 3 TIMES THE RENT IN WHICH SHE DID NOT MEANTION THE WEEK BEFORE. She tried giving this little pep talk about how she believes how well blah blah blah. And keep up the good work and blah blah blah. Keep in touch with me and blah blah blah. Come by anytime and blah blah blah. Gave us back our papers and pretty much brushed us out of her office. Last week she got up from her desk and walked us to the door. Today she stayed seated and said nice meeting you all. Smh. Glad she didnt waste our time by doing a credit check and leaving us with an inquiry to lower our score for no reason. At least she spare us that. Good thing we actually own our houses and dont really need an apartment complex or else we would be screwed. We only wanted an apartment because we wanted a fresh start on a different side of town. But if the people here at cedar creek is going to be doing random pop up changes out of the blue like that and we haven't even made it to being a resident then I can only image what it would have been like if we actually did move in. .....thanks for the surprise( we dont qualify because we are short 300 bucks)\nChanges, thanks for giving us the info that wasnt given the week before. Thanks for us wasting our time and our gas. I mean had she told us this stuff last week...3 times the rent to qualify, the rent is going to be going up to 725 for a one bedroom in the month of December because the owner decided to make upgrades. Had she been honest from jump we would have just not even wasted our time. And we could have just gone somewhere else. I think it all was a trick to be honest. Hoping to hurry up and get us in then out of the blue pop up with the surprise you now have to pay 725....yes we are a bit angry but at the same time grateful that things didnt go that way.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a5cb9b73c9b:0x405cc1454f32147d"}

There was inadequate lighting in the parking lot with them turning off the tennis court lights all the time so it always felt unsafe at night. Management had a very high turn over rate so that says a lot. Appliances would break with maintenance not fixing them in a timely manner.

Mind you, I paid my rent every month on time, kept the place clean, and rarely ever complained about anything. Most landlords would consider that a good tenant and would want to keep that sort of tenant. This place did not respect me or even cared how good of a tenant I was.

For Mobile, they are nice, updated, and spacious. When we first moved in, we were extremely satisfied with the place: great customer service, nice grounds, and quick response to maintenance requests. However, after three or so months, an up stairs neighbor moved in with two kids. We could hear EVERYTHING. For the price, you would think that the walls wouldn\u2019t be so paper thin. I could hear conversations, the garbage disposal (not to mention it would even rattle the ceiling), I would hear when they vacuumed, their kids would sound like a marching band all hours of the day/night. I\u2019ve lived in apartments before, but I have never experienced anything like that. Even cheaper apartments never sounded like that. I had a new born and only wondered if my neighbors could here him cry at night. Towards the end of our lease (month 12-13), we started to feel stuffy in the master bedroom and ended up discovering black mold around the windows (in both the master and guest bedrooms). I wish I would have gotten a picture, but between the move and living with my parents for most of the last month, I forgot. Lastly, upon moving out, we were told that we did not owe anything after a walk through inspection. the girl who assisted us, I think her name is Sarah not sure, only requested that we check the tubs (which are super cheap and hard to clean) and the oven. After we checked those and cleaned those, we signed a paper stating we did not owe anything. A week later we received an email stating we owed $468.26 in carpet damages. The girl who did our walk through tried saving herself and told the manger that she told us about the carpet; however, she only mentioned the oven and tubs.

My husband and I have lived here for about nine months now, and the standards for the kind of people management has allowed here has gone down. Not sure of change of management or not, but we have been sorely disappointed with the people that have been allowed to moved in, not to mention loud as well (we have to constantly listen to loud music until 11:00-12:00 in the night and have filed complaints on separate occasions to no avail). Random pieces of trash that have been purposefully left by residents are just outside the surrounding areas of my apartment. The stairs and walkways/hallways are also in desperate need of cleaning (have not been cleaned in months) and are so disgusting that I am embarrassed to have guests over. To say the least, the only thing going for this place is the excellent and prompt maintenance that came a day after I called to fix some things.

Now they have remodeled with plank flooring (mimics wood) and these apartments were not\ndesigned for that. If you move here you better get an apartment on the top floor. Even before with carpet I could somewhat hear my neighbors upstairs and next to me due to the walls being paper thin, but now it's 100 times worse. Now it sounds like a zoo above me. Even the new neighbor above me stopped me and asked if the noise was bad. I guess he heard me banging on the walls because it was driving me crazy. They woke me up at 2:30 am the other morning and I'm sure they heard me banging the walls and cursing at the top of my lungs. They do have a new baby that constantly runs all day and night. The sad thing is I read reviews of others complaining to Management about this and when I asked about it on two separate occasions, two different members of Management lied to me and said they haven't received complaints when I know for a fact they have. With these new floors, it's not just noise that's bad, it's miserable because you can feel the vibration as they walk around. It's nerve racking and when I complained one response I got was \"well it's no different than when it was carpet\". Trust me, it's different. Typical BS... staff taking it personally and don't want to take a complaint seriously.\n\nThe next issue I have which, seems very minuscule with the noise issues, is that about 8 or 9 months ago they had the fire alarm company doing some maintenance work. Several of the apartments required them to actually come in and cut hole in the ceiling in the living area. They said that Management had a list of apartments that required this and they would be coming back around to fix it. So, not only was there a hole the size of of an iPad, the contractor was a klutz and dropped his drill, hammer, and other tools a few times, and caused the pipe to leak from the ceiling onto the carpet, which I handled my self. When he dropped the tools he scuffed the walls, and put a few noticeable dings in the sheet rock. He stated that it would be all fixed. Well a couple of weeks go by and I asked staff about it and they acted like they had no idea but they would come out and fix everything. That never happened. A month or so goes by and I ask again. Finally got someone from Maintenance to come by and at least patch the whole in the ceiling so i wouldn't have to look at pipes and worry about a rat or some other creature falling out of the whole while I'm watching TV. Well after he patched in the ceiling, that's the last I heard from them regarding this issue. The hole never got smoothed out and never got the ceiling textured. I went to look at a model home with the head manager and I asked about my ceiling stuff and she said she would have someone come out. I asked if I needed to put in a maintenance request so they wouldn't forget but she told me that was not necessary. That never got fixed and I just got tired of asking about it.\n\nI've got nothing negative to say about the maintenance crew. On the few occasions I needed something they've always been prompt and resolved all maintenance related issues.\n\nSo basically, I'm paying a thousand bucks a month for a two bedroom apartment and I've got to look at a hole in my ceiling and dings in my walls. But nothing tops the noise issue. It is terrible.

Everyone should be able to respect each other and not cause any discomfort whether by playing loud music, doing laundry at odd hours at nights etc. We can all cohabitate and be happy if we set boundaries within out own space.

Until they began accepting HUD welfare recipients and allowing every type of filthy, loud ghetto trash, the kind of people who refuse to follow rules, scum who blasts music all hours of the day and night, throw trash in the parking lot and talk like everybody on the property wants to hear them, all while living in a place they can\u2019t afford - so the taxpayers get to pay the majority of their rent while they destroy what was a beautiful apartment community. (Management won\u2019t even attempt to make them obey the rules, probably in fear of being labeled \u201cracist\u201d if they dare expect them to follow rules.)\nNaturally when this happened, all of the decent quiet inhabits became disgusted with the unruly welfare trash and moved out. Of course the management doesn\u2019t care - They still get their money whether it be from quality residents who work hard or from the government that subsidizes the lazy welfare scum who\u2019ve moved in and destroyed the place.\nIf you\u2019re one of the piles of lazy filth swimming in America\u2019s dumpster of welfare slime and unwilling to live where you can afford, check out Summer Trace where you can pay cents on the dollar while destroying the property and us taxpayers will cover the rest. If you\u2019re an honest, clean and hardworking citizen looking for a nice apartment on the Island, DON\u2019T FALL FOR THE LIES that Summer Trace management has become so well known for, they will say anything convenient at that moment without a thought as to whether it\u2019s true or a lie.\nAnd if you should decide you\u2019d like to live in this ever-expanding ghetto, feel free: But remember to never take the property managers word for ANYTHING, ever.

For the first two years it was great.The property manager Jeanna was wonderful and attentive and the maintenance man, Isaac was quick and responsive to any problems that you had. Then, the apartments were bought out by a company called Allegiant. After the buyout, Jeanna and Isaac, left.\n\nSummer Trace / Allegiant,  couldn't keep a property manager nor a maintenance man, from there on. The maintenance man that was there, threw work requests into a drawer, literally, chapter 13.While I resided there, I may have called maintenance, 4 times in 3 years. The following are incidents and reasons on my decision to move out ASAP:\n\n1) My a/c broke down. It took a month to get repaired, despite my numerous office visits, phone calls and emails.\n2) I received a letter from the Gulf Shores Utilities stating that my water usage was unusually high based on my 2 years of living there. I took the letter, my high utility bills to the office, requesting they find out what was going on. I also called and emailed about this issue. My request sat dormant for 5 months, until my neighbor below me contacted the office about water running into his apartment and black mold. Then, Summer Trace, started trying to fix the issue. They never offered to move my neighbor into another vacant apartment, forced him to live in apartment several weeks with water and black mold. They told me that they were going to tear up my floor. I asked how could I live like that, being where they were going to tear up my floor, was my only entry on the 2nd floor. There was no response. It was fixed though, without my flooring being torn up.\n3) During my last year, there were apartments with 14 - 15 people living in them. This is against the law and a fire hazard\n4) Some tenants would take trash to dumpster and throw trash on ground at dumpster. Needless to say, there was trash all over the premises\n5) Lastly, during the time, with my water issue, I received a letter from Summer Trace / Allegiant, saying that my rent was going up again, 3rd year in a row rent increase, with ALL the issues. That was it !!!\nI hope this will assist anyone else looking to spend their hard earned money on rent, for a place like this.

From the beginning, the women that work there were very short and snooty with us, especially a young girl that worked at the front at the desk with short brown hair. Her nose was so far in the air, I don't even know if she knew what earth looked like. I got the vibe of \"I'm better than you\". No one is better than anyone no matter how much money you make, or what you wear, or what you do for a living. We haven't really had that many issues except a few. First of all, we own a dog. A well trained amazing dog. When we saw the house at first, the carpet was terrible. There was a huge black stain on the carpet in the living room and it was coming up at the seams in some places. You could tell the carpet was cheap and old and quite frankly plain nasty. They (owners/tom west) refused to replace the carpet because we had a dog. Also, the kitchen tile was terrible and in some places of the house, you could tell needed to be replaced. Second, We called Tom West a couple months back about a bed bug infestation. When we moved in, we had noticed little bugs a few places, but in the lease agreement, it stated we were to take care of pest control, not realizing they were bed bugs. We did not have bed bugs at our apartment and had verification from the previous landlord. We never called until about a year later when we couldn't get rid of them and they refused to pay to get them removed after we had tried just about everything. Its laughable now because we are moving out and they are still going to have to pay to remove them. Also, in the moving out procedures, you have to pay to get the carpet cleaned. They want me to have that cheap, stained carpet to get professionally clean knowing they are probably going to remove it anyways. We brought our newborn into this home thinking this could be our home for a bit, and now we are moving out 7 months later because it's just what's best. Over all, I would say the company is ok, but pick them last if you have to. When I rent again, they will be last on my list of companies to go through just mainly because of customer service and not taking care of their customers the way it should be and maybe it has a lot to do with the owners of the property as well in which case they need to be realistic as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892927d935f424d:0x3aa0af9aa07a070d"}

Honestly this has been one of the worst apartments I have ever had the inconvenience of leasing. It\u2019s really a sick joke. It all began when I first moved in. The apartment was NOTHING like the apartment I toured. Besides the apartment not being cleaned (the smell of smoke and plenty of dead bugs everywhere), there were so many inconveniences such as faulty lighting, doors that still do not function correctly (closet and room doors were not made to close or lock for some reason) and horrible appliances.\n\nBut by far, what really made the apartment horrible is the infestation of ROACHES and CONSTANT WATER SHUTOFFS.\n\nSince day one, roaches have been a huge problem throughout the apartment. Every night there would be multiple roaches throughout the apartment, even after constant cleaning and spraying my own pest control. It was so disgusting to the point where I never cooked in the kitchen after the first month (that still didn\u2019t stop the roaches though). One night, a Valet trash employee even told me that this complex had a terrible roach problem.\n\nAs far as the water, you can expect to go without water in the entire apartment for at least 3-5 days every month. I can guarantee it. This may not sound like a lot, but for this to be your \u201chome\u201d, being without water for random, unplanned periods of time is completely UNACCEPTABLE!\n\nPlease save yourself the trouble and look for a better option.

YOU WILL THINK YOU ARE GETTING A GREAT DEAL UNTIL YOU GET TIL THE END ITS DECEIVING. THAT UTILITY DEFERMENT SHOULD BE AN OPTION AND NOT A SURPRISE WHEN ASKED WHAT I NEED TO PAY TO MOVE OUT, because If you are prorated at the end, your rent shouldn\u2019t be 400 dollars more then your other months living there. That\u2019s how they get you. The day I moved out was a Saturday and to my surprise the rent off was closed and I was not notified. THEY DID NOT INFORM US THAT NEW MANAGEMENT HAD TAKEN OVER AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE OPEN ON SATURDAYS ANYMORE When I call that Monday, I\u2019m informed that oh they told the other woman that was moving out on the same day as me, but I was failed to be notified. So I wasted 2 hours of that day just sitting at the office because maybe I thought the person was just on the property showing a model or at lunch. Nope. I was told I could use my deposit to pay my final balance for the utility BS, and that they were changing system and would be called from Carlton Equities, NOPE I HAVENT GOTTEN A CALL YET. I had to search for their number online only to be answered by someone that just says hello, like it\u2019s their personal cell phone. My name was not asked or anything.

Not to mention When I got into the apartment an dining room light bulb had broke and I could never replace it because the screw in was stuck, the carpet was god awful, so I had to spend 2 of my final days deep conditioning and cleaning to floors. When I spoke with other apartment they always said I\u2019m so sorry that Arlington was your first experience in living on your own. THEY CHANGED MANAGEMENT LIKE 3-4 TIMES.

They have changed management staff more times than I can count since we have moved in 3 years ago. Maintenance has only gotten worse since the last change in management. We use to be able to have maintenance come out here same day that we called about an issue. However recently none of our issues are getting resolved and no one is coming out. The roaches are a huge problem for one, it doesn't matter how often we have pest control come out or how often we spray around, the roaches don't stop. They pretty much live in the walls and no one seems to be doing anything about that.\nThe last couple of weeks our dishwasher has been overflowing and not draining. We've had someone come out to \"fix\" it twice by just draining the water manually, and we've been calling almost every day for the last 1 1/2 weeks to get someone back out here because it got worse after whatever he did. It's now flooding all over our floor anytime we turn it on. And everytime we call and they pick it up, which they don't always do, they say \"We'll get someone out there today\" and literally no one ever comes and it's the same repeat process every single day. Our hot water has been out for a few days now as well, and not a single person has come by to fix it. You would think hot water would be considered an urgent issue, but I guess they don't care and only want your rent money. Which by the way they slowly increase with each lease thinking no one is going to notice. It's gone up $120 total within the last few years. Our front door issue is another we have tried to get fixed. You can see and feel the outside light and weather from the inside. Summer time gets hot and the air conditioner stays on almost all day, raising our electricity bill. And winters stay freezing cold and the heat stays on all day. They need to replace the whole door but instead they always put a band aid on everything they touch. We've had someone come out at least 5 different times to fix our lock on the door because the door wouldn't even close shut all the way. If they really care about their residents they would do what is necessary to get a problem fixed, not just keep doing the same cheap thing over and over and over.\nReally we didn't have many issues when we first moved in. It's been getting worse and worse each year and i'm finally fed up with it. They don't always answer the phone and they haven't responded to any emails. PLEASE DO NOT MOVE HERE.

The problem was, I knew nothing of the \"Magic City\" or its neighborhoods. But on the same day I received the offer for the new job, I realized I needed to find a place, and fast. So I downloaded an apartment app and started searching. I had decided on one criteria. I wanted to walk to work.  That should be easy, I thought, there are a tone of loft apartments downtown. The problem is that the large majority of them were black boxes. To this day. I don't know how one would go about taking a look at and discovering availability on these lofts. Without being overly conspiratorial, I will say that to this day I have doubts about the ethics, motives and business practices of so many of these downtown apartments. I still don't know how to crack those black boxes. There was one huge exception. There was a company that managed a couple of downtown lofts that were located less than a five minute walk from my workplace. When I called them and left a message, they called me back in less than 5 minutes. So that same day, I arranged to meet with their guy, Andrew, who would show me some two-bedroom lofts available at both Goodall-Brown and Fix Play. I immediately fell in love with the 3rd floor loft that would become my home for the next year. I loved the rooftop lounge and the apartment's Modern Amenities with exposed brick, 14 ft ceilings with exposed pipes and ducts and beautiful original hardwood floors, as well as my favorite feature, \"the stairs to nowhere\", which became my meditation space, is all I needed to remind me I was not living in an apartment \"complex\". I was home.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that as someone with a less-than-perfect credit score, Goodall-Brown lofts management company, SPM, was great to work with to get my contract through and approved, as they provide options that most companies do not. They also offered me free rent for the remainder of the month, which I totally took advantage of.  In a few weeks I was moved\n\nAlthough I am not a dog owner, I have really enjoyed getting to know my neighbors and their furry friends. They both, the neighbors and their pets, were amicable and friendly as we constantly ran into each other in the elevator.\n\nI also think the  Goodall Brown Lofts are in the absolutely best location to make the most of downtown living in Birmingham. Within 1 block you can walk to El Barrio, Bamboo, Atomic Lounge and Collins bar. Heck, the Wine Loft is in the SAME BUILDING. Within 4 blocks you can add more than a dozen other fantastic bars and restaurants, like Queens Park, Paramount, East West, The Florentine, John's City Diner, The Essential, Pilcrow, Cayo Coco. I have drank or dines at every one of these places and have yet to be disappointed.\n\nIn regards to the management company, I'll never forget that time a few months that I accidentally dropped my keys down the door crack  of the elevator shaft. (Don't ask, but I could hear them banging all the way down to the first floor) Sheepishly I put in a maintenance request on the website and then followed up with a  phone call the next day. Only a day later, Paris, the delightful general manager for SPM, who is a busy lady responsible for a handful of properties, knocked on my door, my keys in hand. She had had to call the elevator company to retrieve them.  I asked her how much I owed her for that service. She waved my question away. \"It's fine\", she said. Needless to say, they are a responsive company when it comes to service calls\n\nI decided in October that I wanted a bigger place and preferably a house. So I found the perfect place and have moved out of Goodall-Brown  as of early December. I know that it was the right decision for me, but that doesn't change the fact that I miss my beautiful loft and the fun of downtown living.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdiCRYM-UrdJtsgU3JhMuLMK9_BZlZ2_0qskFV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbnWvkLify3SF0Bm2vCyROizYfMjXWmcjtHzKo=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5JQOodrzB7ayy-735-HEcs-A-QUiu8H1Epf29=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrQd0fsEaMk13o543mgnzhoxiAO6f_kLrGHu_X=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMa6Gq27BY_a-Am4v2LjXTPXCS0LvNyGe2QVavB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH22sHV7uTr4r5TqqUaWdUgvYqFwUT5NoWSqfP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUHRC_u1wxyN2TSiJcz5aWfragpzTxVbwAUGwU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpBexkOHDpIKt7SFGJ1R8gBRkC_TwspAgdBBBk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxWD55qu_BJwT4XyKXVxicSfjfFY8Jhy2zjOOY=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2F9F1xwsNhAhy4_jIZrD7WJMpd6d8JkRgSCiI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb14_TNXqyjxfvVzYgINrL8ZfitePJanPwUFX0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1608227254215, "text": "Scott, thank you for this truly thoughtful five-star review of Goodall-Brown Lofts!

First, I was having a friend over to visit that had just pulled up a couple minutes before me, only for a neighbor to come out of his apartment to see what they were doing there. I\u2019ve had this same neighbor tap on my car window for no apparently reason, let alone stand behind my car as if he was looking for something in my car. Little did he know I was standing in the window watching his every move. Also, if you work a early morning shift (5am), you\u2019re not suppose to make any noise whatsoever while getting ready for work, or you will receive a noise complaint. God forbid that you have any toddlers. Everyone knows that if you have a toddler, (ones with disabilities), they are going to make noise, they\u2019re going to throw fits. And this leads me to believe that this apartment complex isn\u2019t kid friendly. With COVID-19 going on a child should be able to enjoy themselves in the comfort of their own home. There\u2019s people running up and down the steps, slamming car doors, their apartment doors, and talking loud all night long. Somethings you have to deal with when living in an apartment, especially when you move on the bottom floor. I didn\u2019t move into these apartments to be harassed, nor to walk on egg shells. Every month you\u2019re dealing with your water being brown. I\u2019ve yet to seen any pest control, and to have my a/c filter changes.

I have lived here for about half a year now so I'm pretty familiar with it's ups and downs.\n\nPros:\nManagement is friendly and informative\nMaintenance is responsive\nDecent pricing\nWell lit at night.\n\nCons:\nHorrible roads. (These apartments were built in the 70s and these roads have clearly not been revamped since then. All the time I see people navigating around the large holes and dips in the roads, me included)\nThe units have very poor sound insulation. I can hear my downstairs neighbors and outside way more than I should.\nI see bugs in my apartment every day. Even after repeated pest control visits.\nPoor complex security. NO CAMERAS ACROSS COMPLEX. This is 2019 and this apartment complex has NO CAMERAS covering any of the buildings or parking lots. The only cameras are inside the admin building..\nThere should have cameras on any apartment complex, let alone a 12 building complex... There was a recently a break-in outbreak where 18 cars(according police) had their door windows smashed and broken into at night. And what are the police gonna do? What can they do? NO CAMERAS...\n\nIf you want to have any security to make you feel safe in your living space, I hope you feel comfortable with some locks and windows that can be broken because that'll be all you can get here without providing your own security.\n\nEdit: I've also been in contact with management since this review and non of the mentioned issues have been resolved.

People speed, it\u2019s hard to maneuver around, and people are constantly parking in the deck without decals and parking in spots that are not actual spots therefore blocking other people in. There\u2019s also no guest parking so if you have friends they probably won\u2019t be coming over. They also have the WORST staff and management I\u2019ve ever dealt with. I got locked out of my room one night and tried calling the emergency after hour numbers multiple times and they never answered so I slept on our couch. Some of them are nice but most are incompetent and even rude. The manager Christina is rude and mean. She literally yelled at me before I moved in and was scolding me like a child. I honestly don\u2019t see how she still has a job here because she\u2019s terrible. Really, the only good thing about living here is the location, and sometimes they give us free food.

At Evolve, move-in resembled a WWE Royal Rumble. Entering the deck on move-in day took two hours. The lines for the elevator were longer than those for Space Mountain, so we had to climb the stairs with our arms full of heavy boxes. I had lived in the dorms at Auburn previously, and they staggered the move-in days. The management at Evolve, however, thought it was a great idea to have 1000 people show up all at once trying to cram their stuff up the building.\n\nThe management is not so much malevolent as they are incompetent. They are unknowledgeable and unprofessional. My work order took over a month to complete because the management ordered the wrong part. The wi-fi is spotty. Heaps of garbage bags accumulate in the hall. After the elevators were overworked during move-in day, the residents compounded the abuse by splattering them with vomit. The whole place just reeks. If you still want to live here, I\u2019d recommend a HAZMAT suit and experience at a bio level 4 lab. But seriously, always carry hand sanitizer and shower twice a day.\n\nAs bad as the management was, some of the tenants tried their very hardest to out-do them. The delinquents stripped the buildings of all signage: room numbers, elevator signs, even the exit signs. It\u2019s going to be a disaster the day someone gets alcohol poisoning because the 911 first responders will die of old age before they find where to go. If you want a good night\u2019s sleep, your best bet is to go to your car, which will not be anywhere near the assigned parking spot that you paid for.\n\nIn the end, what should have been a great experience was marred by constant frustration and disappointment.

The maintenance crew is sorry and does not know how to do their job. I've been having issues with my Ac/ heater for months now. The maintenance guys are always trying to cover an issue that needs to be fixed with a \"bandaid\" instead of actually fixing it. The maintenance guys kept saying in order for it to get \"hot\" I would have to turn the thermostat to 85\u00b0 or higher. The rent office finally decided to get a contractor out here after I had to contact corporate about the heater. The contractor discovered that there is a severe leak of antifreeze (which is leaking from a wire/pipe that is inside the brick wall) and the wall would have to be partially broken down to fix the issue. Not to mention the wiring was all screwed up, from the maintenance guys trying to rig things up just to say it was fixed when in actuality it never was. In November (1 week before Thanksgiving), i was told they were  purchasing some portable heaters for us and going to bring them by, and as of today (Jan. 9, 2019), I'm still waiting on the heaters. It has caused the power bill to go up. For the past few weeks, we've been asking when is the heater going to get fixed, and the rent office says sarcastically they're waiting on a part to come in. As of 2 days ago, I was told they are waiting to hear from the contractor to get an estimate on how much it will be to get it fixed. The only thing the rent office offered was to take the amount off of next month's rent and this was after I called corporate again (2 days ago). On yesterday one of the maintenance guys came to \"so call\" fix the heater. This is the same maintenance guy that said the thermostat needs to be set on 85\u00b0 for the heater to work. When he got done screwing the thermostat back on the wall and acting like he was actually doing something, I asked him was it fixed. He said it was. I asked was the issue outside fixed as well, he said he took the whole thing out so that it wouldn't have to be fixed. About 20 minutes later, I called the rent office. I was told that the contractor came out and did what he had to do and that they found another way to fix the heater without having to tear the wall up. As of last night, when I turned the heater on 75\u00b0 there was cold air blowing out. I had to eventually turn it on 85\u00b0 just for the apt to get warm, then I turned the thermostat completely off. This morning, same thing but i had to turn it up to 87\u00b0 because it was blowing out cool air on 85\u00b0. This morning, spoke with the contractor and he said he didn't come out here at all on yesterday and that he only received a call from the rent office on yesterday asking about an estimate to fix the issue about the heater. Obviously the rent office is trying to take short cuts on fixing the  problem and they're lying to corporate as well because when I spoke with corporate this morning, they told me that they were told by the rent office that the heater was fixed. I am very unsatisfied and am looking to take the next steps. I would never recommend this place for my family or friends to reside.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVpVz3GjMR3NKSQZyhWoAadBTbvvA_ZmCCxEGi=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2be733a60111:0x9c6773d2d497e394"}

My husband and I moved to Mobile Al to start our lives.  After touring multiple apartments in the area we liked Inverness Lakes. Upon moving in we toured the area settled on an apartment. I keep up on our credit but was told we would have to pay $600 in administration fees just to move in. I should have taken this as a negative sign. But my husband and I needed to get moved so we could get back to work. So we paid it. We moved in and at first really enjoyed the lake and ducks and such. My husband and I travel for work so we really were only there a few days a month. Soon we realized maintenance was awful we had a flood in the kitchen the first month. They had to cut holes in the wall to repair. They repaired the sink but not the wall it wasn\u2019t until I finally told them we were having a dinner party and this is an eye sore that they finally sent someone. Two months later my husband came home to a flood from the AC units from upstairs flooded our dining room. Our Mail box had been broken into many times. And we didn\u2019t have a garbage disposal for 6mo because we couldn\u2019t get anyone to come fix it. The trash situation is absolutely atrocious. Every day you cannot get near the compactor due to trash all the way out to the street. Many things have been stolen even my lug nut cover on my pick up. But we paid our rent on time every month and soon we discovered Apartment living is not for us.  My husband and I are always away from home. And when home it is so loud people running down stairs constantly we was unable to relax the fire alarm box battery going off. You could not walk the property because people do not pick up after their dogs. Right before we moved  the office called us to tell us they needed to come in and do some measurements I advised them we was out of town and in the middle of moving and didn\u2019t want anyone in our apartment .  They came in our apartment anyway.  We decided to move.  We had been traveling so much prior to moving that we was 11 days late putting in a 60 day notice. Two weeks after getting into our new place we then received a bill for $460.36. We were in shock.  All in all this was a lesson in Apartment living that we will not do again.  I hope whoever is reading this Protect yourself. If you do decide to make this mistake. Know that they are not human and if they can legally charge you for anything they will. All they could get me to for $40 for stove drip pans and late rent. But when I went to the office to confront the issue I saw stacks of bills for tenants some as high as $900. Beware!!!! And they will send you to collection.

I only gave it 1 star bc negative 500 wasn't an option. Or, trust me, that's what I would have put. There is literally 1 dumpster for the entire community. Unless you have a truck, you have to put your trash on your car and drive it to the front. Pretty much everyone here has to do that. So when you're leaving, sometimes there is a line of people dropping off there trash. This makes it very difficult to get out. The dumpster has over flowed practically into the entry way street on multiple occasions. The inside gym is terrible. Most of the free weights are now missing and have been for months. The outdoor grill seldom ever works. When I asked the front desk about it being fixed, the woman rudely told me I should just go buy my own. I couldn't believe it! There are only 2 charcoal grills on 1 side of the lake and 1 is next to the dog park. So if you're looking to grill by the pool, you can't. I have never seen the fire pit lit. When I asked about that the front desk just said \"oh\" and walked off. At this point, I'm not even shocked anymore by their responses. As for my actual apartment, it is not at all practical. I have to completely close the bathroom door (of my 1 bedroom apartment, mind you) to get to my bathroom drawers. The dishwasher doesn't work well, yet is supposed to be new. To get anything clean I have to scrub it before putting it in there and turn the hot water on in the sink for 5 minutes. All the kitchen drawers are slightly too small to fit anything in. The linen closet doors are hard to open and close. Anytime I've called about anything that needs checked or fixed, they \"put in a work order\" and never did anything about it. I've had to call back repeatedly to get anything done. Most of the time, they had no recollection of said work order. Ergo, there is evidently little to no organization and communication amongst the staff. Now, I'm a little OCD about cleanliness, and yet I've had a mild bug problem when I moved in. They took 2 weeks to look into it. This makes no sense to me. When I asked for a new filter for my AC, they had to order more which took 3 weeks. I had to be the 1 to inquire if it had come in, bc they never let me know when it did. The people in the front office are not helpful in the least. Furthermore, the prices and fees are absurd. Especially bc I'm essentially paying for amenities that I don't even get a chance to use! I could go on for days about how much I hate living here, but hopefully what I've already said is enough.

I was excited to apply, but was told to wait because \u201csomeone else is interested in applying.\u201d I\u2019ve never been told to wait to apply in case someone else wants it? Weird. So a few days pass and I called almost every day trying to get an update on whether or not to turn my application in.

You\u2019d think they\u2019d be excited to take my money and move me in but whatever. I called exactly a week ago (Friday, 9/11) and was told that she\u2019d have answer for me the following Monday. Never heard from her, and honestly I dodged a bullet.\nI know for sure it was because of how young I am.(20) While touring the apartment she was telling me this is a quiet community, everyone there is like a family, lots of elder residents, and they take noise very seriously. I understand all of that and I\u2019m a quiet and reserved person myself so I thought it would be a perfect fit.\nThe lack communication is astounding. It\u2019s an apartment, if she would\u2019ve been honest and said no from the get-go I would\u2019ve moved on and looked elsewhere. But I was just left hanging.

If you are considering moving here and you get a lot of stuff delivered, please take this into consideration, or better yet, swing by and see for yourself how confusing this place is.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891a76c74e924f:0x9bc1922d504eb055"}

While they look like pretty luxury apartments, everything is very cheaply made. We had 2 doorknobs completely fall off in both units. In the second unit we lived in, the doorknob to the bedroom was already hanging off completely. Maintenance isn\u2019t great. While they\u2019re nice, they don\u2019t actually fix anything until they have to. We had the heat and AC break at least 12 times before they finally replaced a part to actually fix it. Often in 90-100 degree weather when we were trying to work from home.\n\nThe management had maintenance keep up the grounds to an annoying and unnecessary degree. Ive been power washed when stepping out of my front porch. The halls reek of gasoline once a week so bad it comes in the apartment bc they leaf blow constantly. They are obsessed with keeping up appearances but don\u2019t actually fix the important things.\n\nThe gates worked ONE day in the 2 years I lived there, no joke. We chose that place because it was a gated community. It is not a gated community, and it is not safe. There were constant break-ins in cars and apartments. One car was set fire and literally reduced to ash. The management would do nothing. No security, no cameras, no gates. They would however send an email every once in a while explaining that they aren\u2019t liable for breaks ins and they keep up \u201ccertain security measures.\u201d And that any breaks ins are our responsibility? Also there are no security measures, as I stated. They also are terrible at managing packages and deliveries.\n\nThey charge you $25 a month for valet trash, but they only take one bag and often skip MANY days, and the dumpster is usually full. So we\u2019ll get an email saying \u201cdon\u2019t leave your trash outside the door, the dumpster is full and valet isn\u2019t coming.\u201d so we\u2019re expected to keep bags of trash inside for days? No one would, of course.\n\nThey don\u2019t let dogs off leash and yet put tons of large obstacle course things in the one, TINY area for dogs. So now dogs can\u2019t even run around in there. No one\u2019s dogs would do obstacles of course, so no one goes to the \u201cpark\u201d (tiny fenced in area) anymore. There\u2019s no nearby roads good to walk dogs.\n\nNeighbors are mostly med students living of their parents money. Seriously. Everyone drives very VERY fast through the property, even though there\u2019s always someone walking their dog. People tail you like crazy, everyone\u2019s just pretty rude. I\u2019ve also seen a couple of med students just swing their car door open and hit the car next to them without caring. It\u2019s a pretty stuck up community.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s hardly ever available parking. The lot is almost always full when you come home at night. Very hard to find parking.\n\nThe management is not helpful at all. While they are friendly, it\u2019s absolutely a front. If you ask for help, they suddenly become cold and unreasonable. Very two-faced. They just don\u2019t care and are actually pretty rude if you ask for ANY help.\n\nDefinitely the worst management I've ever dealt with.

One occasion I witnessed lawn care blatantly blowing rocks and other trash under, on and around my car. I told management but apparently that did nothing. My car was broken into while on the premises and was pretty much told To make sure my doors were locked. Also my car was scratched and back into many times so beware of neighbors. Also As far as management Suzie was the only person that i didn't have a terrible experience with. Lisa Bearden who is the Community Manger, and Hunter Wright who was many times at the desk when going into the office either didn't pay attention to detail or just forgot things very easily. Upon moving out I signed the necessary documents but there seems to be a communication issue within the office. When one person told me one thing, someone else said something completely different.  I emailed Hunter and Lisa many times upon my move out date to make sure that everything was correct and that there wasn't a discrepancy in dates (which it was). Not even three days after my move out date I received a bill saying I stayed two extra days. The one star is sufficient due to the amount of headaches i received in the year living here. When moving in the apartment was not move in. You definitely don\u2019t get your monies worth. Also whenever someone leaves a honest review they want to turn it around on the tenant. What does cleaning fees and damages have to do with the unorganized staff and cheaply put together apartment?", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNd52-a6xiEP4jD9VR5hq-iZT-rhYEB-e3mIWj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnZA5BvaDBtxpNzMglsh9wzu2bZRvdZSRabE00=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1557158612015, "text": "Hi Breunca, thank you for leaving your comments. We are very sorry to learn you were disappointed in your experience at Chace Lake. We completely understand the frustrations and inconvenience that is caused when the water has to be shut off. Unfortunately, the property is unable to shut water off to individual units or isolated buildings; when a repair is required, they have to shut the whole property off temporarily. Because of this, whenever possible, management tries to notify residents at least 24 hours in advance. If it is an emergency, sometimes there is not enough time to provide advance notice. We hope this helps shed a little light on these occurrences! We are so sorry to hear about your car break-in. The team aims to provide the best advice and customer care. We understand there were some varying move-out dates between roommates, as well as a few damage and cleaning charges; if you have any questions about move-out charges, please don't hesitate to ask the office! We appreciate this opportunity to address some of your concerns. - Lindsay, Bell Customer Service"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889223c3cff5eb3:0x6d837ed94496892"}

The staff and maintenance teams were awesome, and super responsive to maintenance needs and other leasing questions. I had a leaking shower head at one point, and it was fixed within a day. My AC unit needed some attention, and it was resolved in the same day. Pest control is a great addition... many would complain, but never report it. You have to report it for them to handle it.

We were told we were getting a second level apartment with hardwood throughout, but did not happen. We got all carpet on the 3rd floor. That complicates things with a toddler. I think they confused apartments or something. It was moving day, so we didn\u2019t make a fuss. Other than that we love the apartment, community, and location The office staff is always friendly and helpful when we need them. Very clean and well kept, quite and friendly. We\u2019ve had to have a few maintenance calls already and they have always been fixed the same day. No fuss or anything! I suggest making sure you get a walk through to confirm what you\u2019re getting before signing a lease. Other than that, I 100% recommend renting from Chace Lake Villas.\n\nEdit- the original review was written 2 months after moving in, and was request by the management. After living here for 12 months, I do not recommend Chace Lake. They\u2019re trash compactor is always broken, they have a dumpster in front of our building that is FOREVER full and absolutely reeking. Our payments are always on autopay and we\u2019ve NEVER missed a single payment, we extended our lease by a month and autopay didn\u2019t automatically update so we were 7 days late. Instead of calling us to notify we had an issue, they leave a threatening letter on our door saying we have 7 days to pay or they\u2019ll evict us. We then try to pay online the day of and then have to go to the office for a 3rd time to find out it has to be money order or cashiers check when it\u2019s late. They\u2019re now under new management which has done ONE thing since the transfer and that\u2019s change our trash valet company. We have so many more issues that need to be addressed other than who takes our trash to the BROKEN trash compactor replacing, overflowing, dumpster.

The water and leaks in the room made me wonder if it was really decorated.

Springer", "time": 1589245162141, "rating": 5.0, "text": "I moved from the East Coast down to Tuscaloosa two months ago, and I did not have the opportunity to see the apartment before moving in. This was also before COVID-19 and social distancing guidelines. I spoke with Emily (Manager) quite a bit and Elijah (Assistant Manager) as well when Emily was not in the office. Emily was so patient, kind, and made the process really stress-free. Being so nervous to rent a home sight-unseen was worrisome, but she helped me feel at ease. She even did a video of my apartment so I could see it prior, but the document was too large so she wasn't able to send it. From this example, Emily goes above and beyond and really wants to make sure all prospective renters feel comfortable. I changed my apartment several times due to move-in dates and we decided to go with a 2B /1.5 BA townhouse.\n\nWhen I walked into our townhouse for the first time, I was absolutely blown away. It's worth it for the extra price. The rooms are spacious, and there's enough privacy in each room so you don't feel everything is completely open which is wonderful. I love our laundry room, the toilet downstairs, and the ridiculous amounts of closet space. The master bedroom has a large walk-in closet, and then there's another room connecting to the closet that I guess is for storage but is also very roomy (not for living quarters). The only downside to the apartment is that we had to buy lamps for each room excluding the kitchen, dining room, bathrooms, and hallway. If you have dogs, this is the perfect place. Having a puppy and a 3 year old pup, the dog park inside the apartment complex is the cherry on top. The dogs get to run around, the people we've met so far have been nice, and I haven't experienced or seen any issues with multiple dogs in the park. If you want to jog (especially in this time with social distancing), the hill and sidewalks can make it a nice alternative. I only had three nights where I could hear the neighbor's music, but that was it (not too distracting or annoying). I spoke with other apartment communities in the area that may look newer and a bit more upscale, but the way Emily and Elijah treated me here at High River made this place even more worth it. I would rather spend my money at a place where I am treated with respect and with kindness, than a place that looks a bit prettier but the staff are not as friendly or as welcome. If you are affiliated with UA, let them know as they have a great partnership which helped nicely with the application fee reduction.\n\nIf you have any issues with maintenance in the home, they will come by ASAP. I put in a request today at 11 AM or so, and they were at my house by 11:30 AM. I will say price wise too, you cannot opt to have the \"Trash Butler\" service. For someone who has difficulty with mobility at times, putting my trash outside my door in the receptacle and someone emptying and taking it to the trash for me is a nice privilege. I have also had no difficulty with packages being dropped off at my door (i.e. Amazon). This place is great. We're excited to check out the amenities once it's safe to do so. The area is ideal and is incredibly convenient. I highly recommend.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589550492719, "text": "Thank you for leaving your feedback for High River.

What High River advertises and what you get is the absolute opposite. I moved from Bakersfield, California to Tuscaloosa to be with my daughter who is a freshman at the University of Alabama.

I was dumb enough to do everything sight unseen and trust what I was told; man was that a mistake. I retired as the Kern County Fire Marshal in California who can be contacted for my credentials. The on site management at the High River apartments are horrible and clearly does not understand the meaning of customer service. Since I am a single parent due to the passing of my wife, I decided to move to Alabama until my daughter graduates.

Lots of maintenance problems too: the air filter in the apartment I stayed at probably hadn't been changed since the place was built because it was completely clogged. First floor apartments have bugs too. The kitchen counters are warped and starting to break, the carpets are nasty, and the cracked window in the bedroom still hasn't gotten fixed either.

We waited just to move into a dirty apartment. Nothing was prepared for us. The mailbox key was the wrong key and the mailbox was broken so we couldn\u2019t get our mail, and of course we were waiting on something important to be delivered. We didn\u2019t have a gate opener so we had to use a code that worked half the time. When I finally received a gate opener it didn\u2019t work because they didn\u2019t activate it. The gate is trash and stopped working. Then our laundry room was flooding b\\c of the air conditioning. We had to call them 3 times before they actually fixed it, just for it to happen again months later. We paid rent EVERY month ON TIME but they would put all the rent either on my account or my room mate\u2019s account so we would get eviction notices. This has happened at least 6 out of the 9 months we have lived here. Then they decide they want to take up the carpet and replace it with something else while we\u2019re still living here!! They kept changing the date so the day ends up being on a week where I have worked three 16-hour days plus I have back issues and need an operation so I\u2019m having to try and move all my stuff out of my room and closet so they can do something they could\u2019ve done after we leave this place!! Which just made my pain worst. For a month or two they had no groundskeeper so there was dog feces all over the property!! Everywhere you stepped you were likely to step in it. The tub is made of horrible material and is terribly hard to clean. The faucet in the bathroom has been leaking since I moved in. The walls are thin and you can hear the people upstairs. The dryer is trash and you have to dry your cloths twice just to get them dry. There\u2019s no button for the garbage disposal. This place is trash for the cost!!

My overall experience here was above average and I did enjoy living at Vie at University Downs, but it was a roller coaster. The staff is AWESOME. Nothing else to say there, they are all really good people and willing to help. I moved in fast and it was very easy, especially from a gentleman named Rulondo who helped me numerous times during my residency. Also, I want to emphasize how impressed I was with the security in the complex. There are numerous guards roaming and keeping watch, I felt very safe here.\n\nIn the units, the floor layouts are nice and the rooms are pretty spacious, the living/dining room especially.\n\nI did however, have a few things I\u2019d like to share. The first negative experience I had was after I was all moved in, I realized my apartment\u2019s living room and dining room was unfurnished. I was informed that when the new ownership took over earlier in 2018, they furnished every unit with furniture. The one I lived in however, had a resident who had been in there prior to the change in management and had personal furniture already in his room. They told him that In order to get the living room stuff: couch, chair, television, tv stand, dining room table, chairs (basically everything one would need in a living space), that he must also accept the bedroom furniture. This meant he had to move all of his stuff out of there. Since he already had everything he needed, he declined.\nIronically, the other two bedroom units were furnished but the living room was still left empty. I tried numerous times to get furniture in this apartment but it felt like the staff really didn\u2019t care about doing this and just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I was told numerous times that because we had already \u201copted out\u201d of receiving furniture months ago, there was \u201cnothing they could do.\u201d Also, I know for a fact there was a plethora of extra furniture available. I let it go because I only signed a short term lease but to me this was unacceptable and simply just laziness on the management\u2019s part.\n\nIn October, the whole complex underwent a network change to a company called Single digits. In summation, we were without internet connection for about two weeks and even after everything was \u201cfixed\u201d I still experienced issues. I discussed this with the staff and I can vouch for them that they did everything they could to get it up and running as fast as possible. However, I don\u2019t know if they made the correct decision going with this company.\n\nSomething minor, but I felt necessary to be addressed is there are a lot of bugs. I am aware this was a problem a long time ago and the staff has previously addressed this, but I still had numerous experiences. Ant infestations: One in my bedroom from the trashcan and one in the kitchen pantry. This was fixed easily by a few and traps but still gross and took a while to clean up the dead ants. I am not sure if the property had been treated for bugs but mine definitely wasn\u2019t, not to mention that there were roaches in the kitchen, often.\n\nAfter seeing what other apartment complex\u2019s are like. Yes, I had a few complaints, but I want to make sure the management can see these because feedback is a great way to improve. Vie at University Downs does have a lot to offer and it was a nice place to live. With a few fixes and changes, this place has the potential to be a top notch choice for living in Tuscaloosa, but changes definitely need to be made. They are upgrading the clubhouse and I assume it will be very nice.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583962215841, "text": "Thank you so much for your useful insights.

I moved in late September to a 3 bedroom unit. However my garbage disposal has constantly went out every month, my hot water heater leaks onto the floor in the washing room and the dryer has to be rigged to keep running and this is just the beginning. I was moved into a unit that was already occupied in which it states on our move in lease if you moved in during the month of august you have 72 hours to get the lights in your name. So I think my apartment already has a power account attached to it that I just have to pay on. I gave something one month however in the month of December my power has been turned off due to it not being in someone's name. I was never notified of ANY of this and to make matters worse neither one of the two people I live with will reply to my text messages nor my calls. I'm just ready for my lease end honestly. If you already have roommates maybe it's not that bad but this is a very unacceptable situation. And to make matters worse the best option the leasing office could give me was to pay the start up fees and bill for Alabama power and bring in the bill and they will charge it to my roommates accounts. First off I shouldn't have to handle this myself, second off why would I want to continue staying in a unit where I can't get a answer from either one on A matter as serious as this. I'm the one without power right now while both of them are gone and nobody is helping me fix this", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481646356614, "text": "Hey Tony,\n\nWe are so sorry that you are having problems with your power.

I understand there is a large amount of residents that occupy this complex, but in-turn, office workers and management should be working urgently to process maintenance requests and to solve other issues to keep PAYING CUSTOMERS satisfied with their living space. This has not been our experience while living here. My sister and I have lived with UD for almost 6 months and requests we put in those 6 months ago have still not been taken care of. Don\u2019t bother calling the office because they probably won\u2019t answer. And they have neglected returning promised phone calls on multiple occasions. Office is known to close earlier than the hours listed on their door/website which is inconvenient for those of us who work, or interested people traveling from out of town. It is very unfortunate because we love the property, but until management changes I believe these issues will remain the same.

I went on about thirty different tours of different complexes in Tuscaloosa to view one bedroom apartments as this was my only option due to the issues I had leading me to needing a place. To say the least a majority of the apartment options in this town are sketch especially when its last minute last chance in May. However when I came to the downs, Bronson took me and my mom and sister on a tour and it was a great experience. I wanted to see the type of unit I would actually be living in as opposed to just a model unit and they understood my concerns so they made it happen. One of the other employees, Jade, let me go into her apartment and see what it was like since that would be the layout I would ultimately end up with, without hesitation or second thought. I ended up signing for this current year and have been here since August. I have nothing but great things to say about the office staff especially Andrew who truly makes anyone's day each time you see him. Being so far away from family no matter what year you are in is always hard but the staff always is so welcoming and caring. When you read other reviews they talk about disasters of maintenance and such where their needs aren't attended to but I have not seen where that's an issue. Like normal there are always going to be household things that need fixing no matter where you live, its just a part of life and being a tenant. I have had my fair share of unwanted critters (yikes its ok I am alive still) or leaks/minor breaks but no matter what the office always responded fast and urgent for me. People fail to forget that its usually just one person, Ryan, doing all the repairs so they need to cut him some slack and be understanding that the issue will be addressed quickly but maybe not immediately. As far as safety goes, I feel secure at the apartment and the one incident where I was nervous about someone near my apartment I called the office and legitimately a golf cart, and I am talking like one of those extended ones, full of staff came zooming in and investigated and checked in on me to make sure I was okay, including Taylor Duncan the leasing manager too. I find that the staff really makes the living experience worth while at apartment complexes which is why I gave 5 stars overall. I had a few hiccups here and there with maintenance or billing like I mentioned but those issues were resolved to a level of satisfaction which is the part that matters most. Now that this novel of a review is over have a great day and if you are in a predicament where you need not just a house but a home stop on over here at UD!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1518124468038, "text": "Thank you Tiffani Greene for sharing your fantastic experience with us.

When I first began paperwork with them they were undergoing renovations, which at the time was exciting to see. When I came in a couple weeks later to finish my paperwork they had lost it! Papers that had my entire identity plastered all over them as well as my co-signers (parents) info! This happened TWO more times. When everything was finally taken care of I had signed during an incentive to get a $600 dollar gift card or use it as credit towards my first months rent, so being the poor college student that I am I put it towards my rent, well when it came time to pay first months rent they told me I couldn't use that incentive because I was in a privately owned unit. Why would you assign a resident who signed during an incentive special, a condo that's privately owned therefore cancelling out that incentive?\n\nIt's just one inconvenience after another with these guys. Probably because they can't get a property management company to stick around long enough for things to flow smoothly. University Downs has gone through three ownerships since I've been involved with them. The staff is almost entirely undertrained or under-qualified to be handling the responsibilities they're supposed to take care of with ease. Nearly every question is answered with \"I'll have to check with my manger when they get back\". Which then leads to nothing because the manager is never around.\n\nAlso if you're planning to live on the condo side rather than the apartment side then please know that all those inclusions they promise like wifi/cable or Google Chromecast are NOT included. They didn't share that until after we had signed or lease.\n\nTruly an awful experience. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for housing. Aside from the awful management the condos are higher quality builds than most of the newer places, however be prepared to do all of the move-in cleaning yourself, I've never seen such a gross move-in room.

However, my experience with University Downs in Tuscaloosa has been an absolute nightmare. The experience has been so negative that it warrants more than just a bad review, but also legal action.\nAfter the new management company (Asset Campus Housing) bought the complex from Ellis-Trick, all of the services went downhill. From trash pickup to rent payment every facet of life at UD changed for the worse. Most importantly, the management staff (not necessarily the office staff) has been unhelpful, incompetent, and downright rude.\nFirst, even though my name was on the lease (I am looking at a copy right now), my name was NEVER put into their system, so every time I called they couldn\u2019t speak with me (or pull up my lease apparently). Furthermore, they never put any of the emails on my lease into their system. When my roommate wrote a check for $785 instead of $795 on accident, we were never notified of the \u201clate payment\u201d either by phone or email \u2013 even though they had both. So they after a few months that $10 charge grew into hundreds. They then had the audacity to place an eviction notice on my door. So they can walk to my apartment to threaten eviction but they can\u2019t notify me of a $10 dollar payment??? Needless to say I paid the $10 dollars I owed them, but not a penny more! And I wished it ended there\u2026\nWhen I moved to a different city over the summer (and paid two rents because I didn\u2019t want to sublease!) they actually moved another person into my apartment!!!! I found out about this when I went back to my apartment on checkout day (to turn in my key) and there was someone else living in there with all their stuff! I have had two UD employees acknowledge this, but they don\u2019t see a problem with it at all \u2013 even though I was still paying rent!\nFinally, after months of phone calls, emails, and weeks on end of no response, I still have not received my security deposit back. They have acknowledge \u2013 finally \u2013 that they owe me the security deposit, but now they said they \u201cmailed the check.\u201d That was over three weeks ago. This is on the point of ridiculous. The managers at the office do not care. They are rude and completely unprofessional. I have friends who have been through similar experiences at UD! And you should understand. I took pride in my apartment. It was always clean inside and out, and well taken care of.\nI could go on for another page or two\u2026\nI am going back to Tuscaloosa in a few years, and they could not PAY ME to live there.\nFinally, apparently the complex is being purchased by a new company in 2016. Don\u2019t live there!!! They are keeping the same rude and unprofessional managers \u2013 so nothing will change. In fact, it will probably get worse.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a82f5f021da3:0x9a4a2ef42a843052"}

The appliances all do not work correctly. Staff/maintenance comes in whenever (literally they will knock and, from the back bedroom, not give us enough time to put pants on and go open the door before they are already letting themselves in) to fix or change things without even telling residents. They have just come in our place numerous times this year with numerous excuses. They tell you they would give residents a heads up if they have to come in, but that is not true. One day while we had multiple friends over, they came in and said they had to paint all our walls. Needless to say, that was the final straw and we told them they could not paint that day randomly without telling us, while we had people over. We live on the second story and one morning we were woken up at 8 am bc some workers had climbed up the back balconies and were on our back porch working, of course without telling us. I have never lived somewhere where maintenance just comes in without warning so many times in a year. Our friends have a joke going on about hanging at our apartment because maintenance will probably be joining us. Also, one day when they randomly came, we had an empty cat litter box. No cat, not cat toys/food, not even cat litter, just the empty box, and then they tried to charge us $500 by saying we had a pet and kept coming by randomly to catch a nonexistent cat in our place. Even then, $500 seemed like much for a cat. Another thing, along with not telling any residents about maintenance coming to do anything in residents places, they have also decided to change the internet connection and password without telling residents. We went almost a week, a school week without internet is very difficult, thinking the internet had gone out without being fixed. We finally called and they told us it had been changed. We told them we were not happy they would do that without telling us, therefore making us go without. The next day, after we had gone the week without internet and then resolved the issue, they came by and put a paper in our door telling us they changed the internet, so at least our complaining did something, even if it was a week too late.\nOverall, you will not have the privacy you want in your apartment and do not count on the staff/maintenance to do great jobs. If you can get pass that, the pools and community itself is not bad, just needs better people running it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a82f5f021da3:0x9a4a2ef42a843052"}

This complex is previously known as \"Harbor on the 6th\", and if you search for reviews with that name, you will definitely learn the truth about this complex. As many others have said before me, it definitely is not all that it is said to be. Starting with the apartments themselves, they are nothing spectacular. The walls are paper thin-you can hear everything going on around you, the carpet comes up so easily (even when you vacuum), and plenty of carpenter ants make their way through the windows even though the complex claims to provide their residents with pest control every month. There are also no elevators in most of the buildings so prepare yourself to walk a multitude of steps before making it to your apartment. The front gates to enter the complex never work and always seem to be broken! And people are typically going 50+mph while driving through the complex. The parking situation is another disaster in itself. Half the time, many of the handicapped spots are taken by vehicles that have no handicap tag at all. On top of that, there are typically no spots available close to your unit, and you have to park and take the hike from the parking deck (ex: this is awful when carrying groceries). As for management, it is truly a challenge to get in contact with the office. There have been plenty of times that I have attempted to reach out, and in fact, have received absolutely no response whatsoever. Please thoroughly research your apartment options before signing a lease here. It'll save you the trouble, and a lot of money. I understand that it is considered to be affordable student housing, but after all of the random charges that'll be billed to you, you'll definitely be paying more than you expected.

Building 2 has had no lights at the front doors for over 3 months and the only excuse they give me is some BS about bidding for contracts. The AC units barely work and all need to be replaced but they don't care. They just slap on some duck tape and pour freon into the units and assume that's good enough.(mildly exaggerating that last sentence)\n\nSome contractors showed up for a weekend and replaced some rotted wood, pressure washed the sidewalks, and slapped on a new coat of paint on the rails stairs and doors but that's about it. I'm more inclined to believe that they did all of it because management either doesn't want corporate to know how s*** of a job they are doing or they don't want to scare off potential marks.\n\nIn short, they don't give two f***s about their tenants and are far more inclined to overcharge than ACTUALLY MANAGE AND MAINTAIN THE COMPLEX.\n--------------------------------------------------\nNot the best but certainly not the worst. A lot of management shuffling happened along with poor work ethic but they seem to be trying to clean house.\n\nThe area is still kind of dodgy but I haven't heard gun shots in the last six months (So... progress I guess? Maybe the hooligans all wiped each other out?)\n\nAll in all, it has the potential to get better and the two bedroom floor plan and layout is pretty nice.

If you are really concerned about how you live and where you live, this place is not it. My experience with this place about this time last year has been horrible, I can only speak for myself, but I've had a water leak that I reported in April of last year, they didn't move a muscle, I literally had to get The City Ordinance and the County Health Department in my apartment to get them to come out. In November, I found where the leak was coming from and it was actually a horribly water leak in the wall and to top it all, it created mold. And it's bad, you can smell it as soon as you walk through the door, keep in mind nothing has been done. I reached out to the City ordinance and Health Dept to come out and inspect it, they came out as requested, took pictures and recorded the water leak, after they completed their inspection they immediately informed the leasing office of the issues they found in my place, guess what, they tore my door down trying to get in to fix this leak,  they found the leak and turned off the water to the apartment that was leaking and still hadn't made a move on fixing it. I'm moving out is all that matters. I found this out in court, PLEASE PUT IN WRITING WHENEVER YOU HAVE A MAINTENANCE ISSUE, BY ALL MEANS, TELL THEM WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND YOU WILL GIVE THEM 14 DAYS TO FIX THE ISSUE, IF ITS NOT FIXED IN 14 DAYS, YOU ARE BREAKING YOUR LEASE AND YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT PER COURT, 100% facts from the judge mouth. we just went to court behind all of this and inside the courtroom and this is one piece of information they used against me, so I am spreading this out to everybody known to man, you have a right to know because they won't tell you from the landlords law and the tenants laws, neither will they put it in your lease agreement because you can use it against them. So I use it to my advantage. Trust me, I found this out in court that you have the right and it's a law to break your lease if it's not fixed in that time frame you specify. Once again, I can only speak for myself. My neighbor behind me had suffered from the same water leak, it actually went through her ceiling, she says she will post it and show pictures on here and everywhere else soon, but I can't speak for her but I've seen the pictures. You have other communities in Huntsville that is amazing with gated community, several pools, and with great people who cares and affordable living, and courtesy officers, clean, etc, etc,.... Please consider someplace else, they working on the leasing office as we speak and got it looking like the top of a cruise ship, it's amazing, taking the rent up from $550 to $700.00, that's crazy, and have over 30 something apartments that's empty, this place is not worth $700.00, I'm sorry, But can't fix maintenance issues. Another note is they maintenance guy came out the first of April last year to fix my air, he blew out my transformer inside my A/C unit and never returned. I suffered the entire summer without air,  I purchase a floor AC unit but it kept tripping the circuit breaker, if I'd none that I can give them that notice in writing about giving them 14 days, I would have used it,  but I know now and thats facts......

When I reported and issue it was done immediately\u200b. Now that they have new ownership\u200b and management, its been a complete kiosk\u200b. Shooting\u200b every weekend and all weekend long, fighting all weekend, someone was killed here recently ( see it on the web), trash all over the entire complex. Where you park your cars at night in the parking lot is not safe, there's no light out here period, only the ones connected to the building or your doorstep and half of those lights are out. Its dark outside at night in this complex ITS NOT SAFE for the tenants and their/ our kids. The office is more concern about stressing payments, late dues, mail, rent going up, and/ or any issues pertaining\u200b to office and administration. Basically forcing authority but not fixing safety and living condition, such as walls, ceiling and ceiling cracks, old cabinets\u200b in kitchens and bathrooms, carpet, fireplace leakage, water bugs, wasp, etc. None of this is being handle but they want to show that I Am A Boss type. Me personally, I look at a place and decides to live there especially\u200b affordable\u200b and want to call it home because I am reaching out to this particular\u200b place to settle and raise kids. Lately i've spoken with several residents but they don't feel this way. With new management and ownership\u200b, this place is bad, not safe, no good communication or communicating at all, they would rather move somewhere expensive\u200b and live comfortable and safe rather to live somewhere isn't safe and micromanaging\u200b, but here, tenants feel that new take overs are forcing authority, and not looking at issues, trashy\u200b parking lots and hundreds of more concerns. Not to talk down on the place but the truth speaks loud and clear, ride out there and see for yourself, its in plain view. The property\u200b owner or management\u200b doesn't\u200b care about this place, their defense\u200b is renovations\u200b but this issue been going on way before they started renovating.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1550612589785, "text": "Hello,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave a review.

The place has many roaches, they are everywhere, including inside smoke alarms. My lease ended 3/14/2021, so here comes the drama. I'm thinking that since I would be at the apartment only half a month, I would only pay my prorated rent for that month. I was wrong. I received a notice saying that I have to pay an extra $327.00 which was for the utility company that they had last used in early 2020. I was told that everyone who lived at the apartment complex prior to March 2020 had to pay this fee for January and February 2020. I paid my rent and utilities every month, btw the utility fee is $149.00. I had a three-bedroom. I just paid them over $1200.00, and since I didn't have enough money to pay them on time I had to pay a $101.00 late fee. So I had to pay them an amount of a full month's rent all while trying to get another apartment. No other apartment would approve me because I had a balance with this apartment. It's been an entire mess. I was never told about this utility fee until recently. They just threw it on me like \"hey here's you're prorated rent amount plus this $327.00 that you owe from 2020 that we didn't tell you about.\" If you move here prepare to get scammed out of your money, and when you move out add another $300.00+ to your prorated rent.

I have seen a revolving door of employees come in and out of this office. It seems that no one stays which speaks volumes about the company managing this property.  I have even spoke to the new manager on several occasions and I have tried for well over a month for my requests to get addressed. Its been poor effort in my eyes, he did power wash the breeze way, but the workers had to come through my apt to get the water. The company's employees did not even have proper work attire when arriving which made me question who they were (sketchy) the breezeways looked  a little better but there is carpet in half of the breezeway which still smells. I had requested that a tile in fireplace be repaired from several people in my office not sure it was from the old or the new management because again so many people have been in and out of the office. But needless to say I spoke to the manager to get this fixed and two weeks later I called to ask about when it will be addressed and he sent me to speak to maintenance manager and she assured my tile would be repaired.  I allowed to enter even if I was not home but a month later still not fixed.  On top of it all I had to bother them about my renewal they had assured if I signed another 12 month lease it would get done. But because these issue I let the manager know these items are still not done, how can I expect to be taken care of for another 12 months.  My lease ended in April and here we are in June my items still not addressed i will not renew my lease until they repair my items and he promised not to charge a Month to Month fee until my items are addressed. But  this month my bill was rather high and I asked them to email a copy of my ledger and they said I had to request it in an email and I can send it to whoever. Now does that make sense to anyone?

I have put in several tickets and the service teams comes out and do what they do, it works for at most 2 days then back out. I have been having random people come in and out of my place during a PANDEMIC for the same issue. So I head to the front office and talk with Tonatha E the Assistant Manager who was quick to rush me out of her office while I was trying to explain the situation and the inconvenience this has been because I work from home and its out outside and inside. So I send the email Monday 7-20-2020 and she again confirms that she will get back to me in 72 hours. I didn't count Monday as one of the three days so, Thursday still haven't heard anything. So today 7-24-2020 I decided to send another email stating I haven't heard from you and its been past the allotted time that was advised. wait a couple hours and still no reply. So I drive up, meet a nice lady out front and I explain to her my situation and that I need to talk with Tonatha E the Assistant Manager. The nice lady walks into her office and then returns to tell me that she said she was busy and that I need to go see someone else in another building.

DO NOT LIVE HERE\nThe Park at Hoover, as of this week, is going on a MONTH (on the 18th) of doing noting about the ABUNDANCE of mold growing in our bathroom and master closet due to THEIR toilet/plumbing failing and flooding our apartment. Not only was it water but it was urine and feces ridden sewage backed up. When I confronted office staff for the millionth time after they had been running me in circles for weeks, they said \"there was no moisture\" as if the moisture wasn't already dried and molded by week 3. Then when I told them about my chronic asthma and how I cannot live in an environment like that (I had already tried and began having sharp pains in my lungs and shortness of breath), they did not care at all and acted as if the apartment was livable. Maintenance manager even said he would put out a dehumidifier (if you know anything about mold you know this is useless) and he didn't even bother doing that. The Park at Hoover is CHEAP and didn't want to dish out the money to have the carpet, carpet padding and probably wood removed from the floor by an outside contractor. THEN when I contacted my attorney for help with getting out of my lease, all of the sudden they thought it would be a good time to bring up how they found paraphernalia in my apartment, then when I called the next day to see if the mold had been fixed office staff put me on hold to \"check the status\" only to return with the area manager who EVICTED US (over the phone)!!!! I literally cannot make this stuff up. Obviously the paraphernalia was seen a month ago (when the flood first happened) and they JUST NOW bring it up, nearly a month later, because they knew I was in the right. We literally had to wear full face masks with filters to move our things out. Knowing this apartment complex I know for a fact the majority of apartments maintenance works in have some type of \"violation\" of the lease inside. I wouldn't be surprised if they bandaid repair this damage and put another family in there. This place is as crooked and backwards as they come.

A thorough review of the apartment home was completed where no signs of microbial growth were seen. During this review, paraphernalia was found in the home.

I have been in the complex since August, and I have already outlive at least three management companies.\n\nWhen I moved in, the apartment was in horrible condition. We found nails and screws in the carpet, the kitchen counters were sticky and covered with food stains, the walls were scratched to pieces and had hand prints, cobwebs in every corner, vents covered in dust, cracks and chips in the drywall, electrical outlets with not power and the god-awful, malfunctioning smoke detector that goes off every 12 hours.... It is now July, THESE ISSUES ARE STILL NOT FIX! Neither Maintenance, the leasing office or the cleaning crew took responsibility. All of my maintenance requests went unanswered.\n\nNot to mention that for a MONTH I had a leak in my ceiling, causing plaster to fall constantly. It was ONLY after I complain to the Regional Manager of the management company did someone finally come to resolve the issue ...my other problems have never been address.\n\nI can't pay my bill online because it has my monthly rent listed at a different price than what was on my signed lease. Do not even get me started about the utilities bill that only began to appear midway through my stay. I signed my lease with a flat rate that included certain utilities ...now I'm being charge roughly $150 a month for things that were originally included in my lease. It is totally absurd.\n\nThe leasing office is closed when I leave for work and when I return home for the evening, making it impossible for me to handle things face-to-face. Don't try to call, I have never once had any message I've left be returned.\n\nThe icing on this cake - Since the leasing office is closed when I'm off work, I leave my rent check under the door. In May, I left my check with a stapled letter attached giving my 60 Days Notice. They got my rent check, of course, but my letter was misplaced. I was told it was likely thrown away by a temporary employee ...and now I'm being punished for their mistake. I am being forced to pay two more months of rent outside of my lease (which ends in early August) that totals over $1,100 because an employee threw away my notice.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor --- DO NOT LIVE HERE!

We went to look at the model apartment and decided to move there based on the fact that we could move out after we bought a home.  The staff seemed caring and helpful.  After we agreed and signed a reservation agreement, the staff never answered the phone, never called us back and when they did talk to us, they would say one thing, and then either do the opposite or tell us the opposite the next time we asked.  A week before we were to move, we found out that they were changing our apartments due to a water leak.  The day before we were to move, we went up there to look at the apartment, but it wasn't ready and they wouldn't let us in.  After we sat there forever, they let us in and we found no lights at all in the apt.  The next day, we packed up to move and called and the apartment wasn't ready as of 1 p.m. that day, move in day, and they wouldn't let the utility people in, even though they assured us they would.  We were then told that the policy is you can't get the keys until after 5 p.m. the day you pay your first rent.  Who moves at 5 p.m. at night, especially when the office closes at 7?!  We went up there to finally tell them we weren't moving.  When we got there, the staff, one who wrote a glowing Google review of the apt by the way, yelled at us, called us liars and asked us to leave.  I've never been treated with such disrespect in my life.  This is how you treat a customer, a client?  In the end, we're happy we didn't move in there.  Through work, I've met people who live there and say it's an awful place, things are always broken and it's not a safe place to live.  So, I plead with you, please don't even consider this place!

I moved here initially on a seven month lease, and had heard the horror stories, but thought the low rent prices would make it worth my while. DEAD WRONG. The first apartment was a nice size, but the walls were gross and the carpet was terribly stained and wreaked of smoke and cat urine. \"No big deal\", I thought, \"you get what you pay for.\" After moving in, I realized that the dryer vents were clogged with lent, which is a fire hazard. I told maintenance and no one ever came out to clear the dryer vent. Since it was just a seven month lease, I didn't worry too much, hoping that it wouldn't catch fire in that short time.\n\nWhen the lease was up, I decided to move to a cheaper apartment in the complex that wouldn't potentially catch fire when I tried to do my laundry. At this time, the complex was being overtaken by the THIRD management company of my short time there and prices were again changing. The leasing manager showed me an apartment and gave me a good moving price and told me he would change the carpets and put in new appliances just for me. All new everything for a good deal? Ok sure. Two months went by, and the last day of my lease was coming up and the leasing manager still had not shown me the actual apartment I was scheduled to move in to.\n\nFast forward to 7:00 PM the NIGHT AFTER I should be moving in and a leasing consultant is showing me the apartment while a contractor is still measuring and laying down carpet. With nowhere else to go, I was forced to sign the lease without the apartment being finished.\n\nI could list all the problems that the apartment still has that I have put in numerous requests for maintenance to repair, but I'd be typing all night.

On November 25, 2015, the building next to mine caught on fire. I considered moving then, but I thought, \u201cNah, what are the chances of this happening again?\u201d Silly me.\n\nOn January 27th, 2018, the building I was living in caught on fire, jeopardizing the structure of the building, destroying several units, and causing smoke damage to multiple other units. All of the residents were displaced. Below is my best recollection of the events as I remember them from that day and after.\n\nAfter the fire, they herded all of the displaced residents down into the main office where they did have some food for us. But, while all of us fire victims sat there stunned, it appeared the leasing staff was still renting apartments out to new residents. I think the appropriate thing to do would have been to cease all leasing operations for that day and attend to the residents that just lost their homes. But, I guess they thought it was cool since they bought us some pizza, chocolate, and chicken strips to chow down on while we all tried to start piecing our lives back together. How generous and courteous of them!\n\nThey also brought in a third party restoration company that lined us up and made us sign paperwork because they said they were in charge of securing the building, and they needed our signatures. They were vague about what else they did. A few days later, I found out what they really do is clean and restore items damaged by smoke and fire. I was given an example of how much it was to restore a single couch. The answer: $3000. How do you pay for this? They\u2019ll do it all by billing your insurance company directly to get the payout from your renters policy. Vultures. I didn't accept their services. And, if their initial responsibility was to secure the building, they did a really crappy job of it, because thieves broke into the damaged apartments a couple weeks later. Is this the type of company that The Park at Hoover aligns themselves with? Looks like it!\n\nThe Park at Hoover was very insistent on quickly finding a new apartment in their complex for me. They said it was because they cared. They said I had to make a decision fast because everyone in our building had already signed leases, and they were running out of units. But, all of the fire victims had shared our phone numbers with each other. None we talked to had signed a lease or were planning on living there. It seems the only things they really \u201ccared\u201d about was not losing a tenant, even if it meant lying to us to achieve that. How compassionate of them to \u201ccare\u201d so much!\n\nOnce I decided to move from this place, The Park at Hoover called me multiple times saying they wanted their keys to the unit back. A unit that can\u2019t be lived in because the building caught on fire. A unit where the lock was broken because thieves had kicked the door in. Absurdity!\n\nAlong with the danger of possibly being toasted like a marshmallow for a s\u2019more, here are some other things you can look expect if you dare to live here:\n- Heat? Nah. Who needs that? Apparently not me since my heater was broken for two years before they fixed it.\n\n- Indoor floods? You got it! When the temperature outside was below freezing, the pipes to the sprinkler system would burst, and the outdoor corridor would flood along with the apartment. Buy some galoshes. You\u2019ll need them.\n\n- Mold? You betcha! And, if you tell them about it, their solution is to paint over it. I guess their policy is \u201cout of sight, out of mind.\u201d\n\n- Constant, random disruptions in water services? Yep! Expect that at least once or twice a month. Hope you didn\u2019t have a shower planned.\n\n- Mountains of garbage? In the words of the Kool-Aid man: OH, YEAH! The garbage dumpster is constantly overflowing (sometimes into the street), and will sit like that for days, and on occasion, weeks. Oh, and the dumpster caught on fire once too. I know because I was the one that called for help.\n\nIn conclusion, don\u2019t live here.

We only signed the contract because my boyfriend started work the next day and we didn't have time to apply else where. The manager (David) didn't even find fault with the fact that the apartment wasn't ready.

The unit was not ready on my move-in date (despite this date being on a signed document produced by the company) and I had to make last minute arrangements to stay with a friend for two days while they finished getting the unit ready. During the two years I lived there the complex changed hands twice and I had to deal with three different companies and their policies. For a while you could pay rent online, which was nice, but that would go away for several months at a time when the complex changed hands and you'd have to use money orders. During the Fall of 2016 the major water issues started and the complex would randomly do an \"emergency shutoff\" several times per month. I was charged a flat rate of around $120/month for water (I lived in a one bedroom apartment alone - my previous bill was $30) and I was never compensated for my days without water. Occasionally we'd get a paper flyer warning us of the impending water loss -like over Thanksgiving weekend - but it was usually a surprise that would make you show up dirty or late for work (after showering at the gym or at a friend's house). It was really embarrassing for your boss and coworkers to think you didn't pay your water bill. Other than that I had a solid year and a half of roaches as well as hardware and plumbing issues that submitting work orders did nothing for (it's a placebo system, I'm guessing, as no one ever came to fix anything). The roach cure was long term use of Boric acid around the baseboards and behind all the appliances as well as buying a seal for the front door. They are all over the walkways outside at night so they just come in through any small opening if they're not already inside. I also was told there were four pools there - I could only ever find two that ever had water in them. The front pool is 100% to lure in customers but was locked for all of 2015 and no one was allowed to use it. The back pool was green and also locked but was patrolled less so you could sort of use it. Upsides were that I felt like I got a lot of square footage for my money ($600 for a spacious one bed/one bath with balcony) and they repainted the whole complex in December 2016. (Not so funny sidestory-when they repainted there was no warning or schedule so one day I was late to work because there was a tarp over my car and the workers wouldn't let me remove it while they spray painted the side of the building. Another morning I awoke to a man on the inside of my balcony and I had to scramble to get dressed in front of him and it was terrible.) Moving out was a huge relief and I wouldn't want anyone to have to repeat my experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226f20cd3ef5:0xaa9d21311ee6804b"}

When you talk to the people in the office about your many concerns, they say they don't have time to address the small problems. Overall horrible experience!!! When you request to speak to a manager, they say they will deliver the message to them. I have yet to talk to anyone about my many concerns. I will not be renewing my lease and I definitely would not recommend this property to anyone!!! Stay away!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226f20cd3ef5:0xaa9d21311ee6804b"}

The unit was not ready on my move-in date (despite this date being on a signed document produced by the company) and I had to make last minute arrangements to stay with a friend for two days while they finished getting the unit ready. During the two years I lived there the complex changed hands twice and I had to deal with three different companies and their policies. For a while you could pay rent online, which was nice, but that would go away for several months at a time when the complex changed hands and you'd have to use money orders. During the Fall of 2016 the major water issues started and the complex would randomly do an \"emergency shutoff\" several times per month. I was charged a flat rate of around $120/month for water (I lived in a one bedroom apartment alone - my previous bill was $30) and I was never compensated for my days without water. Occasionally we'd get a paper flyer warning us of the impending water loss -like over Thanksgiving weekend - but it was usually a surprise that would make you show up dirty or late for work (after showering at the gym or at a friend's house). It was really embarrassing for your boss and coworkers to think you didn't pay your water bill. Other than that I had a solid year and a half of roaches as well as hardware and plumbing issues that submitting work orders did nothing for (it's a placebo system, I'm guessing, as no one ever came to fix anything). The roach cure was long term use of Boric acid around the baseboards and behind all the appliances as well as buying a seal for the front door. They are all over the walkways outside at night so they just come in through any small opening if they're not already inside. I also was told there were four pools there - I could only ever find two that ever had water in them. The front pool is 100% to lure in customers but was locked for all of 2015 and no one was allowed to use it. The back pool was green and also locked but was patrolled less so you could sort of use it. Upsides were that I felt like I got a lot of square footage for my money ($600 for a spacious one bed/one bath with balcony) and they repainted the whole complex in December 2016. (Not so funny sidestory-when they repainted there was no warning or schedule so one day I was late to work because there was a tarp over my car and the workers wouldn't let me remove it while they spray painted the side of the building. Another morning I awoke to a man on the inside of my balcony and I had to scramble to get dressed in front of him and it was terrible.) Moving out was a huge relief and I wouldn't want anyone to have to repeat my experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226f20cd3ef5:0xaa9d21311ee6804b"}

My lease ended in Dec of this year so thank goodness I left . But if you are looking for a new place to live in hoover this isn't the place to choose. When I first  moved in the everything was fine but the staff was always so rude I can tell they were irritated anytime I would call to ask any questions. Which that should have thrown a red flag anyways but I had to move fast so I signed a lease quick before  even doing my research on this place. When I say these ppl are rude and they don't do what you ask them to do they literally are. The maintenance people take forever literally.. there is mold all under the sinks in bathrooms and in kitchen.. I brought that up and no one came but when I moved out the ppl they moved in after me told me that they spray painted on top of the mold. These people are a joke and someone needs to call the health department on them. On top of that they care nothing about the residents they approve to live in there apt complex.. bc its clear that they just approve anyone. People are nasty loud and my car got stolen at this apt complex .. But to top it off the last 3 months of me living here, I have no idea where all these roaches came from. Im OCD I clean constantly ... they came out of nowhere like a whole family of them. & I kid you not I am not even exaggerating a family of them knocked down one of my pics on my wall. It was so disgusting. I notified the office and all they said they were going to send someone to spray my apt. which literally made everything worse. I talked to neighbors and everyone around I noticed had roach bombs so they said they were having the same issue. No one has any clue where these things came from its just so disgusting.. long story short if I wasn't so broke I would have broke my lease and left . But I couldn't b/c I just didn't have that kind of money to break it. So glad im gone and the new apt im in is also in hoover and its a complete upgrade..

I recently moved here in March---I was shown a beautiful apartment and after I submitted the application, they called to tell me that there was something wrong with the apartment, but the had another one available in the same location with the exact same floor plan.  I agreed (which was my mistake for not taking another tour, but lesson learned), and was placed in an apartment in the exact floor plan but not the same condition.  The associate who moved me in did not do a walk through with me, and when I informed the apartment manager of that, she told me that she would get back to me....still waiting.\n\nI moved into an apartment that was not move-in ready.  There were dead roaches every where....one of the closet doors was off its hinge, the apartment was not painted (I know that because there are some children's scribbles all over the doors and walls), the carpets were not replaced or changed (and they are disgusting), the apartment itself is dingy and dirty.  If you step outside onto my patio, you will find discarded toys and stray cats.\n\nThe maintenance here is terrible.  They \"fix\" things in a timely manner, but they don't do it correctly.  My dryer wasn't working with the dryer connections, and after the maintenance man was certain that it was my dryer and not the outlet---I had someone else come look at it and replace the broken dryer outlet.  The dumpsters are always overflowing; I'm unsure if it's because they don't empty the dumpster often enough or because there is some shady business going on, but the dumpsters always have bags and bags and bags of trash overflowing from it with mattresses and furniture and the like (I hear from another tenant that this is because they're always evicting people).  Along with that, we have doggie stations located throughout the complex for you to discard your doggie bags when you clean up after your pet.  I moved in March, six months later, the disposals haven't been changed.  People are now just putting their bags on the ground since it can no longer fit in the station.  I wrote and called the office about it, thinking that this is a commonly missed area because we're in the back of the complex..they apologized, but have not emptied the container.\n\nThere were 3 apartments robbed about a month ago; one of them was in my building.  Directly across from her apartment was an empty apartment that didn't have a lock on in and squatters were living there.  Shady things like this occur all over the complex and attract a lot of crime.   The tenants who were robbed were allowed out of their lease...I wish I were so lucky to be allowed out of my lease, but that seems unlikely unless something equally terrible occurs.\n\nMy true concern is how unsympathetic and unconcerned the apartment manager (who is new) is when I brought up these issues to her.  They're only concerned with processing your rent...which isn't available until the 1st of the month, and is past due by the 4th.  If you try to pay your rent before the first, the system doesn't show you how much you owe in rent or water.  You have exactly 3 days to pay what you owe.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226f20cd3ef5:0xaa9d21311ee6804b"}

He was willing to turn in Application and pay for background check and turn in all the required paperwork but the only problem was they want me to be there \"physically\" in the leasing office at the time of transfer which i can't be able to do as I was with my pregnant wife in Georgia and she wasn't be able to travel as per her Dr's recommendation I requested the Manager what if i signed the paper and get it \"Notarized\" from designated Notary public and send it to leasing office they denied as its against their \"Policy\" even offer to give my friend \" Power of Attorney\" so that he can sign on my Behalf they so \"No\"  even tho is Perfectly legal way and will not harm them in any way All the offers of Video chat ,Skype were denied too . I talked to several people in the office even some Manager in \"Corporate Office\" who wants me to send her Medical records and Letters from Dr so that she can \"Think\" about my request but never bothers to call me back or reply to my texts or calls again and one of the \"Assistant Manager\" at the leasing office threaten me with \"Eviction Notice\" and Immediately terminating my lease as i'm voilating the lease agreement by not living there ( Even tho I'm always paying rent on time and none of the neighbors have complains against me ) only because I'm arguing with them to consider my request .I end up submitting my 60 days notice and pay $150 Dollars more in rent after August and move out on 3rd November and Now Its been 18 days I'm trying to update my new address so that they can send me back my \"Deposit Refund Check\" several calls to leasing office only results in taking my no and promise that some one from corporate Accounts call me back .Uptill now there is No \"Ackknowledgment\" from Anywhere that they have my new Address and I dont even know When Am I going to get my Deposit Money back .\n\nThey should Consider their \"Stuck up Rules\" and \"Red tape Techniques\" as we are not living in 70's any more and It actually cost them more in paying cleaning/maintenance crew to get my Apt ready for New tenant instead of letting my friend get the lease transfered on his name and get the Apt as it is and they also lost the prospective future Tenant. I dont recommend any one ever to move to this Apt only because of management i never had any issues with maintenance/safety/Neighborhood.\n\nNote: Some Maintenance Guy Entered into My Apt without any notice or Knocking at the Door on 5th October 2014 as he's been told By Management at leasing office that Apt 4322 is vacant .

Now because of a select few, who didn\u2019t follow the rules, all of our amenities have been striped and we\u2019re not allowed to have guests??? It was one occurrence and the security in this place would allow for management to pinpoint the specific offenders. However, their management style is to put us all in a corner, on lock down, barring guests, instead of making the extra effort to address the situation directly. I moved into an apartment, not a dorm room. I pay significantly for a beautiful apartment and have yet to regret it until now. If this continues to be the management style, as it is shaping up to be with previous decisions they\u2019ve made, I will not be renewing my lease.

As I'm writing this, we are currently without power (not the first or last occasion) and using a mobile hotspot in order to get this warning across. Cars are stuck outside/inside of the parking garage due to the power outage, leaving people trapped within the garage (and unfortunately inside the elevators).\nMoving on to the new, \"rules & regulations\". Back tracking to my tour of the property, I was shown the amazing amenities that I would soon come to be paying a significant amount of money for.. Only to be deceived into learning that there would be constant provisions and addendums added that steal all of our freedoms from each and every amenity once enjoyed. Such addendums are paraphrased below:\n1: No personal furniture are allowed to be used around our pool areas.. Which would be understandable, if we were provided the proper amount of furniture from RAM in the first place.\n2: At this point in time, no guests are allowed to enjoy the beautiful amenities we are paying for, alongside with us. With this being said, there should be a universal enforcement of this addendum and ALL residents, including employees living on site, should also respect this rule accordingly.\n3: Proper swimwear must be worn while enjoying the pool.. Again, understandable UNTIL you read the fine print. Which goes on to explain that, \"cutoffs\" (T-shirts without sleeves) are prohibited from being worn. I would love to have a dialogue with management on this addendum alone.\n\nThat's just to name a few. It is extremely upsetting to see these amazing amenities be stripped away from us, again. With COVID-19 briefly stripping our amenities before, everyone that has now been properly vaccinated are looking forward to adjusting to the new norm and building what could be, and what was promised to be, \"community\".\n\nDon't get me wrong, the residents that live here are nothing short of beautiful people. But we are paying way too much to have a company steal away our freedoms in the manner that they are. Especially in the day in age we are in at the moment.. In which people are needing social interaction to cope with the stresses of life the pandemic has put upon us. The amenities, \"provided\" have the potential to be the structure for amazing community events/safe gatherings. It is simply unfortunate that for the time being, they will remain as that alone.. \"Potential\".\n\nI hope this review, at minimum, will provide the beginning of a dialogue for change.\n\n-Jory Martinez.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1619034545380, "text": "We are very sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with your experience here.

I am highly dissatisfied with how this complex treats its tenants. There are times where there is absolutely NO parking and was under the impression we were able to park in certain areas. We have never been giving a warning or anything. I wake up after working late hours to find my car was towed. The cost being almost 400, we are still in financial crises and the park at wakefield and Wellington did not care nor take time to warn NEW residents of such things. On top of the fact that I've requested over three times for somebody to come look at my heating and air system. Causing my electric Bill to be very high. Still trying to figure out how the electric Bill was 400 in a empty apartment that I purposely cut off all lights and the air because I had not moved in yet and they kept the electric in their name until i changed it over.

There's ALWAYS noise late at night, people yelling, dogs barking and blaring music at ALL hours of the day. We pay for valet trash pick up that seems to only be picked up whenever they feel like it.

Towards the end I was contacting them 3 times a week. The office staff are snide and unwilling to work with anyone and frequently put their pride above the problems of their tennants. At night the noise of cars outside your window is so loud, you'll never get any sleep. Also, people frequently parked in the fire lane the entire night, blocking access to my unit in case of a fire.

My tub leaked into the walls and flooded my kitchen so much so that it was OUTSIDE on my front step from upstairs in my bathroom.. this happened FIVE times, and wasn\u2019t taken seriously until I went live on my Facebook to show the damage publicly. The laundry list of things that have only been halfway fixed since I moved in is ridiculous. The door covering my utility closet fell ON my three year old son because they left the door completely unattached. I was never told that you have to request pest control- there\u2019s been so many bugs and a MOUSE in my apartment. There\u2019s exposed insulation in my kitchen due to no sheet rock being put on the wall. SO MANY ISSUES ON TOP OF THOSE. Finally, as they\u2019ve been working on my apartment (which we are on night nine of being out of my apartment), everything is covered in sheet rock dust. My furniture, my food in my kitchen, etc. NINE DAYS. That doesn\u2019t even include the days I had to pester the assistant property manager about having maintenance come out to my apartment. They put me in a hotel for ONE night and then wanted me to stay in a \u201cguest suite\u201d (MODEL APARTMENT) at another property instead of paying for the hotel any more. After being informed by the property manager that there\u2019s no tv, no internet, etc- I was not willing to stay there as I work from home. Both of my kids are home all day being that it\u2019s summer. It was unacceptable. Now they want to offer $500 off my rent, when they should have put us in a hotel for the nine nights (so far) that we have been out of the apartment- which would have totaled $1,044. I\u2019ve been dealing with this since the first week I moved into this apartment in mid APRIL and I have tried to give them the opportunity to fix it and do right by people who spend money in their company and community but I cannot recommend spending money or living in ANY Arlington properties owned community.

The closet door was off the hinge, the bedroom door wouldn't close, the hot water heater was leaking, the sink wasn't draining properly, another closet door wouldn't open, and there were roaches. There were also gnats in the apartment .  And when we moved in  we noticed that our trash can was outside and it was completely disgusting inside .  So that had to be cleaned out  and put back in the apartment  but I'm guessing it was already in the apartment and that's why so many gnats were in there .  However After about a month all our maintenance problems got fixed. Yet the roaches had not been taken care of. We ended up getting some traps and we still see some also we got drainage for the sink and fix it ourselves. We pay for pest control but they have not came. They don't respond to emails how they should. And when we first moved in a lot of important information was not given, like the mailbox key the code to the laundry room and they didn't tell us that we needed a laundry card in order to do our laundry and that we had to pay for it initially. It says that the apartment is fully equipped however it did not come with a microwave. There are never any parking spots. So we may have to go to another building to park and walk to the apartment. People let their dogs just walk around. One day I was approached by a pitbull, it was nice though however that should not happen. There are no lights in the bedroom or the living room. It does help to save power but it's kind of inconvenient. The apartment smelled like smoke when we moved in when they are supposed to be no smoking. Also there was a huge roach outside of the complex trying to get in but like I said since Pest Control wasn't there they couldn't take care of that problem nor the one in our apartment. Also  the entrance to our apartment has so many spider webs and even like our doorway has spider webs and spiders. last few times I sent an email it said message blocked so I don't know if they blocked me or what but the emails in the past had sent. I really would not recommend this place to anyone. Because I shouldn't have to be scared to walk in my kitchen from a roach as soon as we move into the apartment. Or even to walk out my door afraid that a huge roach will come in.

We lived in a unit for just over a year and our leasing officer has changed 4 times within that year.  The foundation below our hot water heater is cracked and it very well could fall through to the unit below us at any time.  When we first moved in, we didn't have hot water because the hot water heater had a broken wire that was sparking.\nThe unit would have caught on fire had we not called the emergency on call maintenance.  This unit is extremely cheap, and it shows.  When we moved in, there were 2 leaks , one of which took SIX MONTHS TOTAL to fix.  For 3 of those months, there was a 2 ft hole in the ceiling above our shower.  They like to turn off the water supply without sending an email warning you, so good luck making coffee or taking a shower when that happens.  The complex is extremely noisy and neighbors blast music while sitting in their cars parked RIGHT in front of your window at all hours of the night.  Trash can be picked up from your doorstep.  While this seems like a good idea, most people abuse it and leave their nasty trash sitting for way too long, attracting animals and bugs.  #EW.

Up until last November or December when they were purchased by Blue Rock Partners, it was great. Since that time, it has gone downhill despite all the signs and banners everywhere stating otherwise.\n\nThey replaced everyone in the office, and with the exception of the lady just under the head property manager, everyone else is disinterested in helping anyone. They smile and say they will help you and take care of it, yet they do not. The pool is hardly ever open, and they seem unable or unwilling to try to keep it open for all residents to enjoy throughout the week. The advertise a playground, but a quick drive through the complex will answer that question with small children running in harm's way in the road because there is no place for them to play. They have started redoing the interiors, but they are not addressing the bigger problems such as shoddy subfloors that need to be repaired/leveled, poor insulation, and underpowered A/C Units for their town homes. You can dress up the aesthetic, but unless you address the bigger safety/quality of living issues, you aren't fooling anyone once they step foot inside the home. And with the rent being overpriced already, this seems hardly like something that should be allowed to go on by the owners, who are based in Florida.\n\nSpeaking of which, Regina, the Regional Manager, will NOT call you back or speak to you when you can't get anywhere with the local staff. And if you keep calling the corporate number, eventually they won't answer your calls there either. In this day and age where every thing is graded on customer service and resident happiness, they fail miserably at both.\n\nI am not afraid to post this review here because of my right to express my opinion. I am not alone in this thinking either. Most of my neighbors who have been here for some time are looking for other places to live and letting people know that they are not impressed with the management staff here at this complex. This was once a TERRIFIC place to live, but no longer. Word of mouth is already getting around as I overheard someone at work asking about our complex. Before I could even answer, two other people spoke up and said that they heard it was overpriced and they didn't have what they advertised as amenities. So unless they do a 180, they're going to find themselves losing tenants. And I bet that even after reading this review, they still will not try to make amends for anything. That's how they operate as a company.

All but three instances were unannounced. The shortest outage was for 4 hours and the longest outage lasted nearly 2 whole days. (The office tried to claim these outages were not related to a long-standing plumbing issues on the property but instead related to the cold weather bursting pipes, but 4 of the 9 outages happened during the warm months [in AL] between March-November.)\n\nOn average, maintenance requests get filled around 3 weeks after they're put in IF at all. Most of the time to get them taken care of I've had to make daily stops by the office to remind them we still had issues that were not resolved. For instance, it took them over six months to replace a missing window screen that I reported AT MOVE IN.\n\nThe \"valet trash service\" we're charged for monthly rarely collects the trash on all the nights per week they're scheduled, there's been on-going problems with mold in our apartment due to a few leaks taking far too long to be repaired, along with issues with poor construction such as the dishwasher not properly fitting into the allotted space in the kitchen and thus causing unavoidable damage to the wall next to it each time it's opened and closed. Furthermore, the kitchen counter top has been slowly collapsing to rest on the dishwasher because it wasn't properly supported. This has caused a large crack to run nearly all the way across the kitchen counter top where it meets the wall. All these issues were reported months ago with little or no action taken for weeks on end if at all.\n\nI say all this because the maintenance guys are here. They're seeing about fixing the ceiling by the kitchen which was damaged during a leak in our upstairs bathroom a couple MONTHS ago. They're ripping out part of the ceiling and making a giant mess in the kitchen I've already deep-cleaned in preparation for our move-out Saturday. (Whenever the maintenance guys do show up, they never clean up their mess, either.) I suspect they're only fixing it now because they have to in order to trick the next victim, I mean tenant, to move into this apartment.\n\nSomeone send help so I don't totally lose it on the office manager today. I've lived in both cheaper/smaller, and more costly/spacious apartments than this one, but this property has been hands-down the most poorly managed place I've lived.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f40ff5bf105:0x58f1589e51ecd2bf"}

FYI I had to move out early because there was mold in my air conditioning vents after having a major water leak in my ceiling when the condenser broke.  That took 3 days for them to come look at (during the week when maintenance is on the grounds).  They wouldn\u2019t even come look at the mold let alone take care of it.  So I moved out early, Sept 7th & just got my deposit back today feb 22nd.  I got a lawyer & magically got my deposit back within 2 weeks.  I was only there for 1 year & waited 5 1/2 months for my deposit.  During this time they have been through 3 managers.  It is the worst management I have ever dealt with.  The price of the rent sounds good $650 but after they dollar you to death with water, gas, garbage (that they never pick up), bug service (that they never do), you are paying $700-$800 a month and could get a better apt.  This place wouldn\u2019t be worth it at $400 a month.\n\nI moved out 3 months ago & still have not got my deposit back.  I keep calling to check on it.  They told me they mailed it 2 months ago & they keep telling me \u201cit\u2019s in the mail\u201d.  They refuse to reprint a new one & mail it out.  They are still blowing me off and acting like there is nothing they can do to fix it.  In the state of Alabama they have 30 days to get your deposit back to you.

Managers don't care about the residents, they cut the water off without warning most of the time. I understand that repairs are necessary. They destroy property and never come back to fix it when working on repairs.\nThe workers are too lazy to actually check the water and electricity usage of each resident, so they just take a wild guess and charge us for that amount, most of the time being way more. Our monthly bills are never delivered on time and they get mad at us for not paying the specific amount, and if they do deliver it they just throw it on the porch, SOMETIMES they'll tape it to our door. But if they do it'll be a few days late.\nThe repairs call for breaking the road, and the road repairs can take up to months to be fixed. I'll be adding pictures of the roads later.\n\nEdit: 7 months later and surprise surprise!! They haven't fixed the roads!

I've surely never been made to feel as if they don't care about me or my issues.  I see them at least once per month to pay rents.

I was pleasantly surprised with the units being updated with nice appliances, the grounds kept up well, a nice pool with an overall good setting. Also elevate had a short term lease that didn't raise the rent and a nice move in special. Now that I have lived here a little while I can comment on my experiences.. after reading other reviews on google I can honestly say that my experience has been the opposite of others.. the staff has been very helpful and has made me feel at home, Dana made moving in very easy and non complicated. I had an issue with the hot water heater and was fixed before I got home from work. Some people want to pay cheap rent and expect luxury resort style living and I get that.. but you get what you pay for.

The mountain of trash was a direct result of the compactor being broke, it was later fix but it is not emptied on the regular and to be honest some residence are just lazy and don\u2019t want to take it all the way. Some people just leave it outside their doors for days at a time, I have taken pictures and reported it more than once sadly there is no option to upload pictures on here. There is an increase number of roach sighting in and around my building I guess that is a bi product to the trash.\nThe complex can\u2019t be blamed for this, it\u2019s just the neighbors you may get stuck with for the duration of your lease.\n- The complex has a high turn over rate, the management and staff has been changed three times in the last five months, for a short while there were using temporary employees. I have had two packages that were delivered to the front desk within the last 30 days that came up missing, no one is mail handler certified but with such a high turn over you would expect instances like this to have quite often.\n- The new company has been renovating some of the apartments with new carpets, new cupboards and appliances, however the heating and air is old and outdated, the back half of the apartments are always hot, perfect in the winter I am definitely not looking forward to the summer months \ud83d\ude4f.\n- It is a gated community took them 5 months to get the gate fixed, then a week later it stop working, that can be credited to people tailgating and the gating system is just old and needs to be upgraded.\n- There has been a number of thief and vehicle break-ins, I was a victim a couple months ago, one of the camera at the gate is broke, the next is angled away from the entrance/exit so it was no help with the police investigation and don\u2019t expect any help from the apartment either.\n- Like I said in the beginning, it\u2019s a nice complex for the price, I would recommend if you trying to save. Get a P.O Box that would prevent your packages coming up missing. Request pest control at least twice a month in your apartment to keep the roaches on the outside, I can\u2019t advice on the trash situation at the entrance or the measure in place to provide security ie the gate and a working camera system.

The dumpsters are over flowing on weekend, the steps going to dumpsters and the door for the dumpster are so dirty you feel like throwing up. The Community Laundry area is very filthy.  The water flow in showers makes such a big noise that you can hear your neighbor taking shower and sometime it\u2019s very disturbing when those showers are taken in the middle of the night and/or early morning.

There was a leak in my closet which took almost 2 weeks for fixing, the leak under kitchen and master bathroom is taking fever.  Even once repaired leaks go back to leaking within short time of repair.  Couple of maintenance people are very rude.  There are lots of empty promises made to the tenants.

The car washing station vacuum has been broken for some time, and management refuses to fix it; they will not even give an estimated time frame for when it will be fixed.  The water for the car washing station only works intermittently.\n\n*Community Laundry.  The communal laundry facility is filthy.\n\n*Interior.  The interior of the apartment is incredibly inferior for a \"luxury\" apartment.\n\n*Maintenance.  Maintenance is on a very long \"first come, first serve\" basis.  When they finally do arrive, they do a substandard job.\n\n*Noise.  Through the walls you can hear normal, indoor volume conversations of neighbors on all sides of your unit.  The windows block no sound, such that noises from outside the apartment are the same volume inside the apartment.\n\n*Other Tenants.  There are very many other tenants with children, and there appear to no rules (or no enforced rules) about volume or leaving toys strewn about the grounds.\n\n*Management.

I was asked to take down this review by the property manager here at The Magnolia because she didn't want anyone to know what I really thought of this place and its management. Well, I'm putting my review back up and this time it's staying. The Magnolia has some of the worst management I have ever come in contact with. The managers are rude and dismissive of issues that I've had. They have allowed their vendors to enter my room without my knowledge, violating my privacy and then treating the issue like a small minor problem. Maintenance is stoned whenever they come to fix things, never in a timely manner, and the manager denies this fact. In the end, it doesn't matter if you fixed it or not, the process was arduous and awful for me. They were rude almost the ENTIRE time and did not treat me like a customer who is paying their salary. They in NO WAY went above and beyond to assist me. They did the BARE MINIMUM. I have many more complaints that I've already sent to corporate that contain way too much for one google review.

I have renewed multiple times due to the proximity to my workplace and the relatively low rent but working with management has been a nightmare. I have called and visited the front desk FREQUENTLY to try to get a hold of the manager but she is always conveniently \"in a meeting.\" I believe the front desk student assistants do their portion of the job taking down my name, unit & phone # to have her call me back but I have NEVER gotten a call back. It has taken my roommate and I 2.5 YEARS of harassing the front desk student workers only to get a flooring issue \"semi\" resolved by the management. OCCASIONAL email replies as a result of the harassment is the only form of communication we have been receiving. I am also expecting TWO concession payments: one of which clearly states that it would be given out within 30 days (it has been almost two months now) of the lease renewal date and another for referring a friend. This latter one does not even have a contract or a form of agreement, so the only argument I have in favor of my case, is a screenshot of the advertisement from two months ago. When inquired about this issue, the office only came back to me and said that I would hear from corporate soon and took no action whatsoever to accelerate this process. The only positive side of this complex is that the in-house maintenance is usually quick to respond (and the high water pressure is a bonus). There have been more than enough hiccups with our air conditioning which eventually got switched out to a new one (most of the A/C units are probably in need of an upgrade due to age). Gates have been installed as a \"solution\" for all the shootings that have happened recently, but have not been activated as they are still waiting to pass out parking passes/gate access as we approach the THIRD month of the lease term. There have been three changes in management companies in less than three years, which should explain the mess that this apartment is in, but I believe the actual on-site manager, Christina, who has stayed at the site despite the changes, is a main source of all these negative reviews from current residents. If \"short-staffing\" is the issue here, please hire someone else to help her address these matters - this apartment is not maintained well enough to justify the rent and the lack of response that the residents are receiving.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569528416498, "text": "Clara, thank you for sharing this experience with us.

I wouldn't say my experience has been perfect, but you get what you pay for. As The Social is one of the most affordable apartment complexes in Auburn, you shouldn't come here with overly high  expectations. For the price you pay, this is a great complex. They are not as renovated as I had hoped, but the appliances are in good working order, which is all that matters to me. Management has worked with my roommates and I each time we have had an issue. Recently, they credited our accounts after a broken AC unit ran up the power bill. Next week they will be replacing the unit. Maintenance can be slow to respond at times, but this typically coincides with times when many people are putting in requests, such as on move-in day. The staff at The Social are always helpful and have resolved each issue I have presented them with. I would say overall that The Social is a great place to live and I would recommend it to others.\n\nUpdate: Since my original review, all of my kitchen appliances have been replaced. The kitchen was completely redone and I was told I should be getting new furniture in the near future. A new management team has taken over and made vast improvements to the property and to many, if not all, of the units. Currently they are resurfacing the front pool and soon they will be putting a dog park in the back of the complex.

When I first move in the apartment was a mess. Then my roommate kept taking what wasn't hers and when I confronted her about it she got scared and told the office something else and they made me move to a different building in the apartment complex.  It's a good location because Walmart is right across the street. When my lease was up I moved out and was suppose to get my security deposit back. They claimed they didn't have my forwarding address (which I wrote down on the move out paper and outside the envelope I turned in) so they sent it to THEIR address and told me to come pick it up. Once I got there they claim the move out check wasn't there and I drove 30 minutes from another location so I basically wasted my gas. Still waiting on my security deposit refund. I have called numerous times and even called the company that owns the social.\n\nUPDATE:!!!\nI moved back in about 2 years later since they had changed management thinking things were going to get better. They fined me for putting trash outside my door right before I took it out. They just want every little dime you have. Company and management sucks. Still didn\u2019t get my $150 gift card they promised for resigning my lease. This year DEFINITELY WILL NOT be resigning for next year. It\u2019s like living in a damn dorm or jail.

I see security frequently patrolling at night to make sure we\u2019re safe. Also, parking is not an issue. I\u2019ve always found a spot for me and my guests when I have them. However, the Tow company does not play. If you are not in a visitors spot come night time your car will be gone. I\u2019ve experienced this before I was a resident.

I\u2019ve dealt with maintenance men who would get the job done and leave tracks of whatever they fixed, but not here.\n\nThe complex has many events for us.

When I first moved over here it was under different management than it is now. The second year was not so great, my roommates and I was living in apartment where the cabinets door fell off the day we moved in. Which it was only hanging on by hope then.They NEVER came to fix it the entire TWO years we stayed there. Then, once we moved out they wanted to charge us that fee. Yes, we know kind of jacked up since we had put it a work order for it the day we moved in and it fell off. This year I stayed here by myself, my roommates had it with them but, due to the fact I use the Interstate to travel back and forth to Montgomery its closer so I stayed. BIG MISTAKE. I had to pay them $200.00 to transfer into a two bedroom apartment which they stated I could move in mid July. I did not move in until LATE AUGUST. The apartment I moved in was not cleaned properly especially the carpet. The reason I say that was b/c when I moved in here they carpet cleaners people says they were suppose to clean the carpet in the apartment, which was suppose to be VACANT I assume since they came. Well folks the carpet cleaning people NEVER showed back up. So now in this apartment, there are PEST  in the carpet and its literally attacking me. HOW SPOOKY is that. In the words of Dr. Cunningham there are fleas in the apartment. Yet, I have NO DOG NOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ANIMAL. So that had to come from someone who lived here before me. They don't follow the roommate matching paper that you do. They stick you with anyone here. The people at the front office is VERY RUDE!!!!! I would not dare waste another year over here.

The staff is extremely rude, no professionalism whatsoever. If you have a concern and try to explain it to them, they never let you speak and try to talk over you. I\u2019ve left their place in tears because I was never reassured that my concern would be taken care of. They talk to you in a condescending attitude and act as if it\u2019s your issue to deal with, and that they have \"no responsibility\" over it and shouldn\u2019t have to deal with it. They act as if it\u2019s an inconvenience on THEIR part, even though this is their job\u2026\n\nIf you requested random roommates, congratulations, they pair you with the ones who don\u2019t meet your compatibility/ preferences whatsoever. Mine was the complete opposite of me in regards to cleanliness, noise, having friends over, pets, etc. Then they expect YOU to figure it out when there\u2019s conflict, even though the pairing was done on THEIR part. Don\u2019t even bother indicating your preferences on that little \u201cRoommate Matching\u201d sheet because it makes zero difference.\n\nThe first time I got my keys, I was paired with a MALE. I\u2019m a female\u2026 which apartment complex pairs males with females? That just goes to show they don\u2019t even look at the preferences you provide in regards to floor level or roommates. So I had all my stuff ready to move in, but I had to be delayed because of the FIRST mispairing on their part.\n\nI moved into another unit but realized soon enough that this female and I would not work as roommates. You can\u2019t randomly put people together and \"force them\" to work things out. Some people are just NOT meant to live together\u2026 There are things such as pets, having guests over, and electricity use etc that people just aren\u2019t willing to compromise for. After my roommate situation got out of hand, I again went to management demanding a new room assignment. He sat down with my roommate and I and we still couldn\u2019t resolve our issues. He first told us to just \"put up with it\u201d  until our lease ends. Oh okay, so I\u2019m paying $600 a month to \u201cput up with\u201d someone who\u2019s making my place basically UNLIVABLE for me. Y\u2019all, I\u2019m not lying when I say I would have to look for excuses to be out. I felt as if the place wasn\u2019t even mine\u2026 and hated being there because I felt uncomfortable. Anyway, so he FINALLY agreed to move me out into another unit. So that weekend, I packed up all my stuff, said sayonara to my roommate \u2026 and guess what? I NEVER heard anything back from them. I tried to get in contact with them multiple times and\u2026 nothing.

When moving in they told me that the keys to my apartment had not been cut yet that I would need to wait in line for 45 minutes. it was actually closer to two hours. Then I get to my apartment to find that my bedroom door was kicked in and had no way to lock it, they where made aware of it immediately. (it took weeks for them to come and half way fix it). Also there was a roach infestation in every room and my roommates and I had filled a maintenance request on it multiple times. I then went to the office and the bug people came later that week. It took about four weeks for them to actually go away. The apartment was supposed to be newly renovated and mine was not. It has patched walls where someone had started to repair the walls and didn't sand them down or paint over them (this is in every room). the walls are covered in stains and sticky stuff and it does take a while for maintenance requests to get done. The towing people also love to screw you. If you do not have you tag hanging up even if it is on your dashboard they will tow you. I saw an older guy hooking my car up and went downstairs to explain to him that it was right there and he said that it would be $50 because he had already hooked it up or $100 if he towed it. of course I paid it. The security here sucks because it wasn't even 12 am yet and there was domestic dispute/violence and you could hear the female screaming but no one was around to do anything until the cops where called. Also if you choose random roommates they do not do a good job picking them out. They put my neighbors with a person who had a cat when they specifically said they where allergic to cats and then once they figured it out they put them with a another roommate and she also had a cat and they did nothing about it.

Move in had no organization at all, was given numerous incorrect keys and so were the roommates. Most of us gave up after a bit and just shared.\nOnce we get to the room, it was in horrible shape. Most apartment complexes inspect units and ensure everything is in functional shape before a tenant moves in. This is not the case for The Social. I had somewhere in the range of 8 work orders just from day one. Dryer wasn't hooked up, kitchen sink didn't work, ice maker didn't work, garbage disposal didn't work, half our lights didn't turn on and the list goes on. It was roughly 2 months before the Social actually addressed some of these issues, and it took a heated email to corporate and literally CC emails to everyone in the company. There excuse was they only had 2 maintenance men for 1000 units, as if other complexes around Auburn don't have that many.  When they were repaired they were not fixed correctly and I ended up having to go back and fix their mistakes.\n\nThe unit wasn't clean on move in. I bought a $20 vacuum at Walmart did 5 passes on the carpet and the bin was full.  Our countertop was charred and burned and so was the carpet, neither of which was replaced during the stay. The day of move in about 6 guys in \"The Social\" worker shirts , not sure if they were maintenance just spent the day seeing how long they could keep the maintenance golf cart doing a wheelie. Not professional, and definitely a waste on man hours for the company.\n\nThere was never a maintenance schedule to the units, I had to remind them each time that they needed to replace the air filter for the AC unit. The unit itself was an old R22 unit that costs more to run than that in my previous unit that was three times size. The light bulbs in the unit are a round fluorescent type that cost a small fortune to replace and barely produce enough light to see in the living room.\n\nThe majority of the office staff are rude, and love to place blame on others. They had blatantly lied to my face about packages arriving simply because they didn't want to go find it. Many times I had asked to see the property manager, and the simple response was that \"he is on the property but not in the office.\" I said I'll wait for him to get back and they claimed he probably wouldn't be back and they could only contact him if it was some sort of emergency. I eventually got ahold of him by CC an email to his boss and his boss's boss. As a business this is extremely fishy way to operate and train your employees. They lost our check as well and then proceed to try and evict us, then blatantly ignoring us in the office when we went to confront them. Even with check receipts from them written in their handwriting and with their signature they did not believe us.\n\nTo continue their *optional* utility subcontractor made a clerical error,  and charged everyone for power even though we didn't sign up for the service.  Instead of the head office taking care of there contractor all at once the property manager instructed the office workers to tell the residence to handle it themselves. I had no affiliation with their contractor, and yet again they wanted me to do their job for them.\n\nThe general property is not taken care of. Many railings and posts along the steps are missing, along with the wood that is all splintered and heavily cracking. They have a poor locking system on the  basketball and exercise rooms where anyone with the code can get in. So when  people from other neighborhoods come in and trash it they blame and punish all their residence for there inability to provide a halfway decent secure locking system. Most of the equipment in the gym didn't work anyway, so no real loss there. There is 1 dumpster for about 3/4 of the apartments that is a very long walk away compared to most complexes.\n\nThe only pro I can think of is they did have a bowl of mints in the club house, most of which were stale but still edible.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1534359607670, "text": "Thank you for your feedback.

It took over 2 weeks to actually see maintenance after submitting several work orders the first day. If you ask anyone at the front desk anything, prepare for at least 3 different answers and for none of them to be correct. As previously mentioned, the internet they provide is excruciatingly slow. Don't expect to be able to play any kinds of online games or watch Netflix without serious buffer times. Parking is TERRIBLE for visitors. There are only 105 guest parking spots for everyone in the apartment complex. So don't expect to be able to have more than one friend over without them getting towed. I recommend The Social for anyone who wants to legitimize ongoing anger issues.\n\nUPDATE: Well they had forgotten to post electricity on our bill. So once they finally noticed, we got a notice on our door saying that they would charge us $40 a month per month they missed. This is insane. What's more insane is that once we logged in to check our bill, it had jumped to $50 per month because they felt like charging more.

When I initially moved in my washer nor dryer worked, my toilet did not flush, only two of the things on the stove worked. All of this the first day of moving in, I had to report my issues a few times before someone was sent to fix them, I understood due to them having only one maintenance guy and he is super nice. Even with these issues I overlooked them because the apartment was nice and ok for the price. As time went on I had numerous issues with billing and them adding charges for electricity to my account multiple times for no reason resulting in large fees that I had to pay to them out of pocket when my electricity was hooked up with Alabama Power and has been. I still overlooked these things, but other things continued to break. My dryer still does not work properly I have to start the dryer over 3-4 times for it to dry clothing which makes doing laundry extremely long. The renovations to the apartment makes it look better and worth the amount I'm paying, however, WiFi is included in the rent and stated as such in my lease but I have been without WiFi in my apartment since the beginning of May and I have contacted them about this and they stated for me to call and send a technician out but a technician has not came out and I have been contacting Charter back and forth for over a month now. If you bring your own router you can connect to the WiFi and establish your own WiFi for your apartment. This was working perfectly fine with me until their workers came to redo the carpeting and flooring in the apartment. Now for me to have the personal WiFi that I had in the past I will have to PAY CHARTER MYSELF FOR WIFI MONTHLY WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. If I'm paying Charter for WiFi then there is no reason that it should be in my rent, the $49 I have to pay Charter should be deducted from my rent. The office staff is really nice but they don't understand a lot of things and aren't much help with things outside of paying rent and the front office. On numerous occasions I have went to them for packages that we delivered and that they signed for and they would tell me that they did not have my package and I would not get it for 2-3 days when they finally decided to do some work and sort through the packages. They don't do much work and rarely are doing anything when you enter the clubhouse. I initially love living at The Social due to it being in a great location, good parking, and located very close to campus. But now I am beginning to regret resigning to live yet again at this nightmare of a place. Whenever there is an issue the property manager of office staff will attempt to contact you to save face but ultimately won't try to fix anything.

Jessi was very easy going, professional, insanely knowledgeable about the properties and apartments in the area, and the whole staff made me feel at home from the moment I walked into their offices. Jessi worked with me over the course of a week or two, whittling down the places I did and didn't like, and eventually found  a place that I ABSOLUTELY love - which is surprising considering how picky I was.

I put a work request in on 8/9/19 no one has yet to come out. I called 8/10/19 they said they will mark it urgent & someone would be out that day. 8/10/19 i took a shower & the water did not run out i had to scoop dirty water out & flush down the toilet. I called 8/11/19 & 8/12/19 about the tub being clogged and they said someone would fix it that day. I come home from work 8/12/19 and it is still a tub full of dirty water. I call the maintenance line and he said he would mark my request urgent and send the on call maintenance man to my apartment ASAP. As the air conditioning man was fixing the air in another apartment he knocks mine out somehow i called about that also.

Things happen, and I was okay with this news. The woman I spoke to on the phone said they would have another apartment available at the same location in two weeks time. That's great! She said they would call me as soon as it was available, and I would be the first person on the waiting list.\nThree weeks go by. I call to check on it after hearing nothing. This time I'm told they don't know what date the apartment will be available---not even a time estimate.\nFast forward three months. No updates. At first I called once a week, and they typically answered the phone, though they were NEVER able to offer a time estimate on the apartment. For the past month, I'm lucky to ever get a person on the phone--instead I have to leave voicemails that have only been answered once.\nAnd now the voicemail box is full. They never answer. I was patient to begin with, but I specifically halted apartment hunting for the apartment they originally said would be ready two weeks after I applied.\nI'm so disappointed with this experience.

Was treated horribly because of my skin color. My girlfriend put in her application for an apartment which basically got approved but her boss wouldn't verify employment over the phone (that's okay and a safe thing to do). Instead of letting her know of the problem, she received no notification. She called to find out days later about the status of her application because she heard nothing from them at all and was told of the problem. For a company needing to fill spots, since empty spots cost money instead of make money, this is a very horrible way for employees to be. When she put in her deposit and we asked about a receipt, we were told the receipt from the money order was enough (the tear off tab). I guess receivership of money doesn't require a receipt for this company or Brittany doesn't understand how a receipt actually works. Every other company we've rented from gives a receipt as proof of receiving a deposit (Arizona, California, Florida, Virginia). Very sketchy. Not a company we want to deal with.\nUpdate (20181106): The response to my review was horrible. Your core values don't mean a thing if there is no true follow-up to a problem so it can be corrected.

This is one of the most disorganized and frustrating realty companies I have ever had the displeasure of having to work with. The shame is that the apartment itself is quite nice, even if it wasn't cleaned before I moved in.\n\nInitially, after Red Rock tried to overcharge me, I was charged twice for my security deposit. Then, when moving in, I was told that the only way to pay my first month's rent was through security deposit and that I had to drop it off in person at their office. What a thoroughly archaic way to collect rent! On top of the fact that their office hours prevent you from actually getting to their office if you have a full time job. Regarding their hours, even if you call while they are supposedly open, never once have they actually answered the phone. And good luck receiving a timely callback if you leave a message, as it takes at least a week for them to respond.\n\nFast forward two months, and I receive a notice of 2 months back rent due plus a late fee and my security deposit. Not only have they lost the record of my security deposit, they failed to note that they already charged me TWICE for it. After spending 2 days on the phone and numerous assurances from multiple employees there that everything is settled, I hope it doesn't happen again. Next month comes along, and I am told I am being threatened with eviction due to $1300+ back rent missing from their records. I am still awaiting a call back regarding this new report of incompetence.\n\nThis company is absolutely horrible when it comes to organization. The only person who has been helpful at their office, Jordan, appears to be the only competent one there, but the issues still keep piling on.

I have been a great tenant, paying rent on time or early, no issues with other neighbors. The maintenance team seems to like to neglect their tenants. I have had water issues personally with water coming up thru my carpet to the vent in the bathroom leaking. To hearing about water it self leaking thru the walls in other apartments. To an upstairs neighbor being out of town with a leaking toilet that then started leaking in another apartment below them and maintenance taking days to show up and fix their issue. March of 2017 I called about water coming up thru my carpet and took me calling multiple times to \u201cfix\u201d said issue. In the past year I have had multiple sinus infection I now feel I can tie the missing link to mold that was never properly taken care of. Now I have tested positive for mold in both my living room and bedroom. I did an air test kit myself, so I now know and have proof of it. (Can\u2019t see it but can smell it)  I assume they\u2019re having issues believing me because I\u2019m unable to see it. I have tried breaking my lease this past Friday on 25 May 2018 and asked them to honor my 30 day notice instead of a 60 day notice due to mold and it seems they have issues honoring that and want me to stay the full 60 days. I came in today may 29 with my mold test kits and am still waiting to hear back from the owner. I am not trying to cause issues, I just want to be able to leave and move on with my life to better my health. I am aware there are no laws in the state of Alabama that cover mold but the fact that they are so money hungry that they are willing to put their tenants health at risk for their rent money.

Read the reviews online. I moved into an apt and 3 days later the worst odor I ever smelt in my life and I had to suffer it for 3 1/2 months before the owner would come out and he was so low down he came out when I wasn't there and removed a dead animal from a crawl space. I saw a dead possum at the end of my building. I made numerous calls & Mark the owner  never  do you need anything  for over 3 months He didn't care. the landlord reduced me to being crazy after the Health Inspector had been to my house twice and sent two letters. The owner said that the letter from the health inspector was not true. I spend a lot of money on Lysol and other products to camouflage the odor and kill the bacteria. the owner to this day still thinks that I don't deserve a dime. and he thinks that he should further punish me by holding my security deposit 5 wks. I have now learned that constructive eviction is not for the tenant it is it is a legal loophole for the landlord to screw you out of your money. Unless you dead or half dead at least in Birmingham Alabama. I finally got the owner to release me from my lease to God be the glory. online reviews or  less than 2.9 now I know why. there was a strong musty odor in the apartment as well.My my eyes would burn a lot I felt my eyeballs were melting . I had headaches & I felt something or someone was dead in the walls to this day I regret not having call the police. Oh I forgot to mention about the so-called preacher Ernest Smith resident manager. Earnest a want to be preacher told as many lies as Mark and red rock. This was the most traumatizing and horrific  ordeal  I do not wish this on anyone. After removing the dead possum from the crawl space I finally got my letter from Mark to release me out of my lease. I moved out the end of June a new tenant moved in the beginning of September. I was told by one of the neighbors a Mexican family moved in at least they had at least two months to clear the air in that particular apartment. Lets name this story the hidden secret why because the apartment was newly renovated. Grandma always said looks are deceiving . I was about a1yr  cancer survivor  and  suffer with COPD with other disabilities. The federal government declared me 100% disabled in the year 2000. Mark the owner apparently thought I was just another hood rat. I lived at 7723 Apartment B 3rd Avenue South. They waited 2 months after I left then moved in a Mexican family. I almost died in there with a stinking possum. I wasn't compensated in anyway. Constructive eviction means nothing in Alabama. Unless you lost a limb or life or a have a class action lawsuit apparently. You call a lawyer and they tell you you should and when you move they tell you to file bankruptcy that's what Jonathan at Legal Aid Society call me with. All the wild suggested that there was no way that legal aid services could assist me. Every 3 months when he's got nothing else better to do he called me stalling till statue has run out. you move they tell you they are glad that you got out of that situation but they can't help you. Calling legal aid is a waste of your doggone time. Constructive eviction as far as I can see is a legal loophole for the landlord to screw you anyway they want to. When you complain they do nothing can't wait till you move don't care about the money you lost. It cost me $1,500 to move in there and $1700 for me to find another place to live. I moved twice in the same year. Everytime Jonathan at Legal Services have nothing else better to do he gives me another call with another bright idea. Is Young still trying to learn his role but I do not appreciate him calling him wasting my time acquiring the same info he got the first time stalling. Whenever you get time Google constructive eviction. Hope you have better luck than I did.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1535376075001, "text": "We are very sorry you had a negative experience with our company.

Reason I don\u2019t recommend is because of maintenance. I\u2019ve been her 2 whole years and my outlet for my dryer hasn\u2019t worked! The first dryer I had went out and it wouldn\u2019t dry my clothes. So I throw it out. Thinking it was the dryer. So I went and bought another one. Still wouldn\u2019t dry my clothes. Then after a month it went out. So at this point I refuse to buy another dryer. So I called an appliance company and someone came out. Come to find out it\u2019s the outlet. They guy said wasn\u2019t enough power pulling through and needed to be replaced. My dryer worked just fine. So I tell the maintenance people about it. And only thing they was going to do was reset the breaker. Till this day, I am still not able to use my dryer. My oven went out about 2 months ago and it still hasn\u2019t been replaced either. You don\u2019t get any updates about your work orders or nothing. I hate it. There is nobody to talk to about the issue or nothing. That\u2019s why when my lease is up I\u2019m moving out.

There are hidden fees that were not explained and I was unaware of until I got my last bill. I had made numerous attempts to reach the office and was unsuccessful until I sent an email stating that I wanted someone to address the complaint I had.

I asked for explanation and I got some crappy excuse about the cost of my bill and told \u201cSorry for the hidden fees.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fine with the rent, water, trash and sewer fee. My first sewer bill was 88 dollars and I think that is unfit and unfair. I understand that there may be an inflation cost with the County or BWW but this is ridiculous. Still it\u2019s been paid on time like everything else. The kicker for me is the \u201cMandatory Cable Service.\u201d I was told that it came with my unit. I\u2019m being charged for 1 HD cable box and 10MB of internet speed that I never even had set up. Recently, I called to get it set up and the customer service rep had a horrible attitude and said that there is a 65 dollar service connection fee due upfront BEFORE they come out to set up service. I was told that this is mandatory although this unit came with cable and internet and I\u2019m being charged 75 dollars monthly for it. Pathetic.\n\nI constantly have problems with my toilet, there\u2019s mildew in the hall and bathroom and my air constantly goes in and out. I\u2019d rather turn a fan on.

Also one of the tenants approached my car one night while I was at the gate accusing me of being the Uber driver for her and her friends. Another tenant approached my friend and I in the parking lot and asked us if we had our car door on hers? Too strict. This place is an antebellum in disguise, not worth it. Steer clear, pay a little more, and be at peace someplace else where you're always be respected. By the way, if you try to leave, they will make you regret it.

As you can see, my vote is three stars out of five. I encourage a full read of this review as it has both positives and some pretty serious considerations before you sign a lease.\n\nTo summarize:\n-good place to live\n-clean apartments with decent amenities\n-friendly and helpful staff\n-prompt maintenance response\n-unnecessary posturing by management if you're a little late on rent\n-expensive fees at move out that are not allowed in the lease and that you can't do much about unless you want to take them to court\n-these fees are charged at a higher rate than the actual repairs\n\nThe Verandas is a pretty good place to live, all things considered. The apartments are nothing fancy. They've got several floor plans and decent amenities like a garden tub in the master bath, pool, gym, etc. Noise is generally low, but you'll still run into the normal foot noise if you live under someone. The front staff are pretty helpful and always nice. Maintenance is quick to respond and you'll get prompt service from their emergency line, if you ever have to call it. Mail delivery and package reception are painless. Again, this place isn't extravagant, but they do have some nice perks to make living here more attractive.\n\nNow with that said, there were a couple of times that I was disappointed.\n\nThey give the standard grace period on rent (5 days in AL), and their lease indicates that if you're late, your lease is terminated. There was one time where I did not have rent to them by COB on the 5th, but I did have it paid electronically before the office opened on the 6th. Still, when I came home from work I had a note in my door telling me my lease had been terminated and that I owed the remainder of my rent promptly. I own that I should have had rent paid by COB on the 1st, but the notice of lease termination was a bit much in light of the fact that I had a zero balance in my account before they opened that day and before they printed the notice. The property manager indicated my lease had not actually been terminated which makes the situation even more unnecessary.\n\nThe Verandas will attempt to get you to replace the carpet when you move out. The pet addendum indicates that you are responsible for carpet replacement after attempts to remove pet stains through cleaning have been unsuccessful. Management made no attempt to clean my carpet before replacement, but still charged me. This is standard practice. When I pointed out that's not what the lease says, the asst. manager admitted there might need to be additional stipulations added to the lease. What does this mean? It means on top of rent, security deposits, pet fees, and any cleaning fees, you're going to be looking at a bill of somewhere between $1400 and $2000 at move-out. What makes it worse is that when I was told of the replacement fee, I was given an invoice from 2019 that turned out to be $400 more than the actual fee for the replacement. I won't say they weren't going to tell me, but I only found out when I started emailing them about the payment. I initiated; they did not.\n\nI give 3 stars because my time at the Verandas was good overall. Although my view of the apt and staff was lessened significantly at move out, I can't let my overall experience at the complex be completely soured. Read the lease, and know what to expect at move out.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600872441080, "text": "M. Olinger, thank you for your feedback and the extensive detail.

This move was planned in advance and arrangements were made with ample time for the apartment to be prepared. When we arrived in Montgomery to pick up the keys and walk the apartment, we were disgusted with the smell in the unit. It smelled of pet urine in all of the closets, the laundry room and the HVAC closet. We immediately went to the office and notified Karey who called Todd, the maintenance supervisor, to come over. Upon checking, he determined he could not smell anything and that they would put an ozone machine inside the apartment before she moved her belongings in and also clean the carpets again. While the smell never totally went away, we put deodorizer in the closets and asked for it to be noted in the file.\n\nWhile living in this apartment, my father-in-law passed away. My mother-in-law went to the office to speak to Mona Smith, the assistant property manager, in regards to her move out options and the costs. She was advised at this time that she could turn in her keys at any point and because of Alabama law, if she didn\u2019t pay rent after the pay or quit letter, her balance would be written off and she wouldn\u2019t owe it. What she failed to properly explain to my mother-in-law is that it would be considered an eviction on her rental history. As a property manager myself, I was concerned that someone would give such terrible advice to a resident that had all intentions of paying the balance. The buy-out fee is equal to 60 days rent with a notice. It was cheaper for her to stay through the end of her lease and pay the prorated rent which I don\u2019t believe was ever explained to her prior to my involvement.\n\nFast forward to the day of move-out which was a complete disaster. Yesterday my mother-in-law went to the office to schedule a move out inspection with Mona for 12p on Tuesday. We had movers arrive at 9:30 to ensure all items would be out and we could clean the apartment. We were ready for the walk through but Mona did not show up. We called the office and asked to speak to Mona but apparently she left for lunch at 11:30 and didn\u2019t bother to call and let us know OR send someone in her absence. After driving to the office to make alternative arrangements, the property manager Stacey was VERY rude and unprofessional in her apology. I do not think she was on a conference call but rather wanted to avoid the conversation. I say this because she walked by us very quickly without so much as an acknowledgement and hesitated to turn around when we asked if she was the property manager. As a manager myself, I expect a sincere apology and a solution to the problem when things do not go according to plan as that is part of the job.\n\nThe service manager completed the walk through for us and we settled the balance at the office as we turned in the keys. We have a 5 hour drive to our destination today so the lack of communication and disregard for our time is not appreciated. To anyone looking to move here, I very seriously suggest you look elsewhere. The property is okay but the experience you have with the staff will leave you feeling dissatisfied and angry. You will not get return phone calls, clear answers to questions or any type of communication. I will add that the maintenance staff was friendly and would always speak and wave to my family. We have reached out to Inland Residential in regards to this experience so that it can be properly addressed. I will update this review once we have resolution.\n\nUPDATE: Bonnie the regional called on 10/22. We returned her call and left a message but have yet to hear back as of 11/7. This company is mismanaged and lacks communication. No, we will not stop by the office AS WE LIVE OUT OF STATE. We are waiting on a call from corporate and filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MANAGEMENT. Didn\u2019t even have the decency to call.

Though they come highly recommended, this complex has some serious flaws.  For one thing, they have a call center that they expect to handle most of their phone traffic, and the number for the leasing office is difficult to find.  And if you do call into the office, they'll let the phone ring and ring and ring if a visitor is in the office--troubling considering some issues can't be handled by a call center and HAVE to be addressed by a staff member, sometimes during my work day when I can't visit the office in person.  Every other complex I've seen tried to strike a good balance between phone service and walk-ins.\n\nThen there's the leasing staff themselves, who seem much more interested in telling you what Alabama law says than they are with actually helping you, in an experience that strongly evokes the worst aspects of visiting a bank.  Now, granted this place has plenty of pros--I love the layout of my apartment, the carpet is soft, and the interior walls seem remarkably well insulated against sound--but what does all that matter, when kids run amok outside, yelling and screaming and bouncing a basketball on the edge of my building for hours at a time?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c3975a3c1b9:0x159ae07d8f70d101"}

I had several issues with management even before I moved in. It took them a while week to get back to me about my application. I had to call and ask the status and of course they said my application must have fallen through the cracks somehow. A whole week wasted. But I continued with the process. I was suppose to be moving in this past Friday but decided not to sign the lease. So called orientation takes uo a lot of time and after the agent finished her spill she actually thought I would sign the lease without viewing the apt unit. Everyone knows that's a no no. The apartment was not up to par..at least for the amou5of rent they are charging. The front bedroom had a cracked that ran right under the crown molding of the ceiling...you cold see how they tried to just paint over it. THey could have easily filled the crack...sanded it...then painted it. But oh no the maintained man was too lazy to do the right thing. On to the kitchen where the bottom lip of the microwave wave has be broken into pieces and they just glued this pieces back on and the coenergy of the door was cracked ask if they were going to fix that if course they said no...only if it messes with the function of the microwave. Wrong answer! Then a placed my attention on to glass cook top the items they devoted two pages about how it's ti be cared for and if it is damanged in any way a teneant would have to replace it. Well the precious cook top had already been burned in places and scratched. Now if a tenant did these damages they would have been charged...so it only makes sense to believe they charged but refused to fix these issues. So if I would have done these damages they would charge me also. They really thought I would sign my name on the line and not have the issues fixed first only a dummy would do that. The exit clause is a beast alone...They have it sewed up tight. The lease even says they make no promises to fix and renovate anything after you are locked in to the lease. Good thing I know words mean nothing when it comes to buiness it's all about that black and white..", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c3975a3c1b9:0x159ae07d8f70d101"}

I just so happen to click on The Tapestry and just from the photos and other details about the complex I was interested. Last week I called inquiring about their available units, I had the pleasure of speaking with Sam who informed me to call the following week for updates on units. After being told there were no available units by other complexes, I received a breath of fresh air with The Tapesty today. I must say Sam left a great impression on me, he was very poliet and patient with each question I asked and answered each question with detail and not just a basic yes/no. I was able to view one of the units and it was not bad. A nice size one bedroom for just me and in a good price range. I was sold and did the paperwork same day with updates on the process. They did not make me feel as if they were just telling me anything to get me to move in an then hit me with the B.S later .

When you come into the rent office they don't speak to you like you are a paying resident with a smile on their face. The one girl that would speak kindly is no longer present. But that is not my biggest concern. This apartment complex is going to be in trouble for the simple fact that I have lived out here for two years now. My apartment has near it a Lamppost in the grass that has been out for several months now. Basically when I come home it's dark. I have submitted a service request two times, 1 via the web and the other in person to the unfriendly staff. I explained to them that me being a young lady living here by myself it's not good for me to continue to come home at night sometimes and walk back there with no light on. Last month I made a third request. Each time I am met with an excuse that they don't handle the lamp post, that it is Alabama Power who does it and that they will get them out there to change the light. It has been four months now and that light is still not working! I don't think the representatives had a sense of urgency to contact the proper people to get this fixed and I'm upset. Not only that, I'm concerned for my safety. Aside from this one major issue, the apartment complex is a great place to live. There is no pest issue. It has beautiful landscaping. It is super quiet. The neighbors are super respectful. This issue right here and the unfriendliness of the staff is the one thing that kept them getting five stars. I cannot ignore the fact that I am being ignored. They are not the ones coming home in the dark each day. I have done my part and notify them of the issue. Somebody can get on a ladder and fix the light! What gets me is how they found a way to charge me $25 for garbage bag sitting at my door in which I was intending to take out but they will not change the lightbulb. It's an utter insult to a good resident.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1495703976951, "text": "Hello Kimberly and thank you very much for reaching out and bringing this to our attention.

If you don\u2019t get a renovated spot, you can use contact paper and make it feel like home which is exactly what it was for us. I put the contact paper on all of the cabinets and countertops so the cabinets looked like they were all completely wood and the countertops looked like they were granite. I got the wood contact paper from the Dollar Tree and the countertop contact paper from Walmart. When it was time to leave, it took seconds to take everything up.

I don\u2019t typically do this but since I saw the good reviews I thought it was great. Let\u2019s start from the beginning.

I get there the day of move in and they say my dog cannot move in because they \u201clost the paper work\u201d after a few hours of arguing I finally was able to move in in order to find my copy of all the paper work. We move in and the place is a mess nothing had been cleaned the carpets had stains everywhere. It was horrible I had never seen anything like it. They said they cleaned it which is weird since I could find tons of syrup or something spilt in the cabinets. I also found tons of dirty spots on the carpet through out the house. When I get to my room there was stains that looked like bleach stains which were easy to see since My bed was completely missing... my door was broke to the bathroom. Then come to find out the toilet was leaking. They never fixed the toilet i put in at least three work orders but it never got fixed so I just had to leave a cup under there and dump it every day so it would ruin my stuff... it wasn\u2019t fixed until they changed out toilets for the entire community.

The house I\u2019m in is much bigger than I expected and there were no issues when I moved in so I am very pleased with that. My only complaints are that the gates are very slow, but that\u2019s a minor inconvenience, and that there are a few hidden fees you can get but it\u2019s all in the lease and the signing bonus more than covers it. It\u2019s also a very safe community the only street that isn\u2019t gated has security on it all night. Overall the cottages is a very nice and safe place to live if you\u2019re willing to pay a little more, also if you\u2019re a student at ua it seems like it\u2019s further from campus than it is, it never takes me more then 10 minutes to get to campus and that\u2019s with traffic.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600286417329, "text": "Thank you, Justin!

The cottages themselves are nice, we only had a couple issues and haven\u2019t had problems getting them fixed. The pool is great and living by the lake is definitely a plus, but there are some cons. First off the utilities went up considerably, everyone that I talked to said that their utility bills were considerably higher since they switched to simple bills. I\u2019m not sure if our meter is messed up but after the first bill we went the rest of the year with the AC turned completely off, only 1 tv in the house, and normal light usage and had overages every month.... probably the most annoying thing, and what may be a much bigger issue with COVID pushing classes online, is that the internet will cut out across the cottages. Some of these incidences lasted a couple days, which with online classes is worrisome...... Also, I wouldn\u2019t sign for the sign on bonuses, I\u2019ve yet to get either of mine or hear anything about them.....\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m living here next year and I\u2019m decently  happy with my current situation, there are some problems, but there are problems almost everywhere.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595005216608, "text": "Hi Adam, thank you for sharing such an honest review and for renewing your lease.

It is the elite package and I live upstairs.\n\nMy experience at the cottages has been no less than excellent. While it isn\u2019t the cheapest place in Tuscaloosa to live, it easily provides the most value, and I\u2019ve been so happy with my stay so far.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know if you are considering the cottages:\n-You live right on the lake which is hands down the best place in the world to relieve stress or to pray if you\u2019re the type.\n-The staff is very friendly, but sometimes don\u2019t really know what they are talking about (I asked about hours last month and got 3 different answers from two people at the front desk). I will say I am sympathetic to them because they are students like me and have not been working there for a number of years like you would get in a non-college town.\n-There are multiple events a semester which, depending on where your cottage is located and when the event is relative to your exams can be either a blessing or a curse. There was a concert that was pointed right at my cottage not too long ago that really disrupted my ability to focus on my studying.\n-I have to pay $15 a month extra because my closet is huge. At first I thought this was outrageous, but having utilized my closet as an office space/storage area and set up a gaming space in my actual bedroom, the $15 a month is justified for the luxury of having so much extra space.\n-You may hear other people complaining about the upstairs being hot and the downstairs being cold. If you have ever lived in a two story building, that is just how temperatures work. Could the buildings have been planned better? As an engineer, the answer I\u2019ll give you is always yes. Would it drastically improve the state of the temperature in your cottage? No, but it would drive your rent price higher.\n-If I had one extra roommate, our parking situation would be awful, but I\u2019m fortunate to have exactly the correct number of spaces around us. The workaround for this is to buy a reserved space for $10/month. They will set up a sign in your front yard and you will always have a spot. That\u2019s 100% worth it in my eyes so I never have to deal with searching for a parking spot coming home from the library at 1 am.\n-You will be late to class if you don\u2019t leave at least 20-25 minutes early, sometimes 35 if your class is on the far side of campus.\n\nAll in all, your experience at this complex is what you make of it. You only share walls with people you can control. The pool is okay, but the lake is incredible. Nucor Steel ruins any chance at seeing the stars in all their glory because of how bright the steel mill is at night, but laying out on the bank of the lake at night under the sky is still a blissful experience that I seek out regularly regardless of temperature. There are plenty of events and giveaways if that\u2019s what you are looking for. Find good, CLEAN roommates, and you\u2019ll have a wonderful experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580490479258, "text": "Thank you so much for your thorough review, David!!

Yet you will be charged the rate of a gated community.\n\nAlso, the fees!!! The Cottages has an airtight contract that will bend you right over. Any utility overage or move out fee they decided to slap on you is impossible to negotiate. I had a roommate ruin the paint in the living room - even after proactively approaching management to resolve the issue, I was charged for 1/4 of the damage. The apartment complex neglected to move out old chairs when they updated furniture - I was charged for that too! The list goes on.\n\nBottom line, don't live here.

You will see a few reviews about how fast they are to respond, but this is only when small things break. Most houses have at least one major issue throughout the year since they are so cheaply built (we had a burst pipe and a shattered glass door) and these issues take forever to resolve. I attached pictures from my bathroom where I had a hole leading outside for 2 weeks. The contractors arrived when no one was home with no warning from the Retreat. They tore out drywall near the leak and didn't cover anything in the bedroom or bathroom so everything was covered in dust (computer, bed, toothbrush, tv, etc). At one point they didn't show up for 2 days and when I went to the main office I was told that the contractors reported that the work was done. They didn't believe me so I had to have someone from the office come look and see for themselves. \"Oh wow that's crazy,\" was their reaction. We have been waiting for our glass door to be fixed for almost 3 weeks now as well. The landscapers cracked the pane and we reported it the same day. Four days later glass was falling out each time the door was opened so we removed the broken pieces and duct taped the edges. The next day the duct tape was removed and more broken glass was on the porch. The main office told us they had tried to fix it but had the wrong sized pane. I don't expect it to be fixed until after we move out. Additionally, you will receive an overage for utilities every month. I don't know a single person living here who doesn't. Dealing with management is also hard because they hide behind the college students at the front desk who really aren't given enough responsibility to help you with any of your problems.

Amenities are nice and the complex itself is really nice too. The area outside of the community is rough though. When I lived here, the staff was pretty meh. I think our biggest complaint about actually living there was their ever increasing restrictions on house parties. There really weren't any rules at first, but then they switched security staff and said all parties had to be ended by 2:00 am. Then it was 1:00 am. Then it was midnight. No idea what this policy is nowadays but that was pretty damn lame, considering its a college town and house parties are fairly common everywhere. When we moved out they hit us with some major fines. Some of it made sense, but some of it was stuff that needed to be done by that point anyway (like replacing carpeting and repainting walls. Yes, they use that awful flat paint that marks up when you look at it). They actually charged me to repaint my room and replace the carpet. I had expected these shenanigans so I provided photo proof that my room did not need to be repainted and I also provided proof that the carpet had never been replaced. I've heard that they do this to a lot of people, charging them for things they don't actually replace or repair. It must be really profitable to charge 2 or 3 people for the same carpet before they actually replace it. Overall, we really enjoyed our time in the Retreat. Had a lot of great memories there.

You will see a few reviews about how fast they are to respond, but this is only when small things break. Most houses have at least one major issue throughout the year since they are so cheaply built (we had a burst pipe and a shattered glass door) and these issues take forever to resolve. I attached pictures from my bathroom where I had a hole leading outside for 2 weeks. The contractors arrived when no one was home with no warning from the Retreat. They tore out drywall near the leak and didn't cover anything in the bedroom or bathroom so everything was covered in dust (computer, bed, toothbrush, tv, etc). At one point they didn't show up for 2 days and when I went to the main office I was told that the contractors reported that the work was done. They didn't believe me so I had to have someone from the office come look and see for themselves. \"Oh wow that's crazy,\" was their reaction. We have been waiting for our glass door to be fixed for almost 3 weeks now as well. The landscapers cracked the pane and we reported it the same day. Four days later glass was falling out each time the door was opened so we removed the broken pieces and duct taped the edges. The next day the duct tape was removed and more broken glass was on the porch. The main office told us they had tried to fix it but had the wrong sized pane. I don't expect it to be fixed until after we move out. Additionally, you will receive an overage for utilities every month. I don't know a single person living here who doesn't. Dealing with management is also hard because they hide behind the college students at the front desk who really aren't given enough responsibility to help you with any of your problems. There's lots of better housing closer to campus, don't bother with this place.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1499364035005, "text": "Thank you for your business and your feedback, Danny.

I found myself using the clubhouse, pool area and other amenities more often than I thought I would, which was a plus. I was a little disappointed when we first moved in and had a lot of broken utilities in the house - fridge missing pieces, Cable not functioning, bent stove handle; but these issues were fixed by staff within the first few days of move in.

Our air conditioning didn't work for weeks in the summer when we moved in, our internet line was broken for months before they got someone to fix the line, and we went another month without a functional microwave. The untimeliness of response to these issues led our house to study for graduate exams without cool air, internet access to study, and other amenities promised to us when we signed. But don't worry, the maintenance man will dig through trash outside the never emptied compacter to slap a $200 fine that must be paid within 24 hours. There are constant overage bill miscalculations that overcharge and are only fixed if pressure is put on management. Overall, the Cottages will attempt to sell you on a lifestyle of luxury, while overcharging you for a lifestyle that doesn't even live up to bare necessity.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554476436880, "text": "Ben, thank you for your detailed feedback.

We appreciate you renewing with us the past three years despite your issues. We apologize about the delay in getting your air and microwave fixed. The A/C unit required a part to be ordered to fix and the microwave is under warranty so we were at the mercy of sears for the repair. As for your internet, you have to reach out to our internet provider, Pavlov, for repairs. Lastly, we have our compactors weighed and emptied on a weekly basis. There are two huge signs outside of phase 1's compactor that tell you not to place your trash outside of the compactor and if you do so, you will receive a $200 fine. We have a compactor in phase 2 to take your trash if phase 1 is ever full. As a courtesy, we have reduced the fine to $50 for you and your roommates. If one person takes wants to take responsibility, we will remove the fines from the other roommates' accounts.

The mystery charges on my bill, ridiculous utility overages while I am not even living there, and poor customer service are only a few reasons we are signing elsewhere after two years of living here. The staff is incredibly incompetent and often times rude, as I am sure they are getting tired of dealing with irate customers. For the same price after overages, you could easily live closer to campus. The amenities are a total joke (broken gym equipment) and they have lost mail before. Buyer beware,  you might talk yourself into looking past the distance from campus but I promise one day you will realize that this place is simply too far away and poorly run to be worth it.

Maintenance requests have always been addressed quickly (our heater went out during January, for example, but someone came out to fix it almost immediately). We did have a pretty big bug/ant problem (maybe because our house backs onto the woodsy area of the neighborhood?), and that was frustrating, but we notified maintenance and an exterminator came a couple of times and took care of it. I love the location, and we have only very rarely had issues with loud/parties noise. The lake is beautiful, and the amenities are great, although maybe a little excessive.

Random fact- I know someone who met their now wife on The Retreat Bar Bus. (just saying) There is also a police officer on call 24/7 if you have any security problems. Yes there will be problems but they will be fixed. You will meet the most amazing people. And you will have the most beautiful pool in the state.

Luckily, my cottage was one of the cottages that got selected for the upgrades and it makes my cottage feel brand new.

Getting to target, midtown and downtown takes around 8-10 minutes as well, but I love the fact that I am \"tucked away\" from all the noise and busyness of traffic and nightlife when I want to be. I have gotten to know the office staff over the multiple years of living here and they are always so willing to help me and other residents.

Furthermore, the leases they make you sign are virtually unbreakable.\nThey consistently make mistakes on their billing and overcharge residents for the most minor details. My unit has been infested with stink bugs for over a year with no change in the condition nor has a statement or strategy been released from management, since this issue amongst others such as, scorpion infestations, impacts many other units. My unit also had a wasp infection which took several weeks to resolve, since the staff was much more interested in protecting the reputation of the apartments rather than solving the issue at hand.\nThey attempt to build a \u201ccommunity\u201d by having plenty of sponsored events, but in my opinion it\u2019s just a marketing scheme to trap new residents and deflect current issues that impact residents.\nI would recommend saving your money by not moving in despite all of the glitz and glamour that they advertise.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536847208418, "text": "Thank you Angela for your honest feedback.

They advertise rent starting just under $600 but with monthly \"fees\" that no one could explain without wanting to bring in a lawyer my rent was always above $775. It even rose above $800 during January due to electric costs. These houses are not built to be energy savings in any way. Our average electric bill, for a house of 4 people, was over $320 every month with AC running about half the time. All the toilets and the dishwasher ran when I first moved in and it took 3 weeks and a call to a building inspector to get it fixed yet no comp was added to our $150 water bill. The local desk is run by kids, that I cant get upset with because they are just working for minimum, but they know nothing. They could not even tell me the name of the cable provider so I could request a repair service. Oh also cable, internet and phone are included in the rent and cannot be separated but youll be lucky to find a house that has all three working, or even finding two that work. My cable has never worked since move in but I gave up trying to get anything done about it. The local manager is a dolt. She gets paid in rent so she is expected to love the community but has no clue about anything. I got double charged twice for rent within the same month and she could not even tell me the name of the accountant who handled the rent. Getting a contact at the corporate office is a game in itself. The property has been bought and sold twice as long as I have lived here and that is only one year. The house itself is classic college living that I overpaid drastically for. I have 2 exposed, non working sockets in the living room since move in. I requested a repair and they just pulled the fuse saying they would get back to it. 10 months later I am still waiting. I have a broken kitchen light that has also not gotten repaired along with a leaking water heater, destroyed flooring and a kitchen cabinet. The upstairs porch railing even fell off during a storm and hit my girlfriend. Their version of repairs was to lock the door on us because it was unsafe to on it anymore. That porch was the reason I signed for the house initially. They also dont guarantee the random roommate process or have any safety protections. I had an ex random roommate move out over winter break because he had graduated. After clearing out, he broke back in and trashed the place as well as stealing everything that was not locked away. Even though he relinquished his keys, the property still had him listed as a tenant so us remaining roommates could not press charges. They even tried to bill us for the damaged door, although this was the one time I was able to get a charge removed with ease signifying that the local manager knows and has the power to do so. Upon refusal to resign our lease, the management team expedited the repair process and has already begun tearing out my kitchen and will be replacing it over the next two months. I have no kitchen for two months. The flashy gimmicks that initially drew me in, and I am sure  you, such as the clubhouse, lake and pool are just surface. The clubhouse has been \"under construction\" since august and is there but not private or usable space. The pool has been closed for a month now due to sewage leak and is not expected to open any time soon and the lake is disgusting, stagnant water. It is stocked but not well so fishing is difficult. Also there is a public access road cutting through the property to the lake so it isnt a private lake. Many public individuals walk by my house daily to get to the lake and left in unlocked houses and cars is common.\n\nAll in all I do not believe this place is worth looking. The price is comparable to higher end apartments, closer to campus and near the strip. You also dont incur the transportation costs such as a car, uber and a parking spot on campus. The expensive cost and poor management staff bring a three star review down to a one.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528207205888, "text": "Dalton, thank you for your feedback.

We also have a Crimson Ride shuttle that runs to campus in 30 minute intervals for your convenience. Our clubhouse was under construction until the month of September to upgrade our amenities for our residents. Our pool is closed due to chlorine levels being very high and the pool needing a part that only one manufacturer makes. We are currently awaiting for that part to come in so we can get the pool open again for our residents and their guests.

Get ready to play games.\n\nStay away from the Brookshires. Despite the huge closets upstairs, the house is only fitted with one AC unit, despite every other floor plan having two. The Retreat acknowledged last year that my AC wasn't strong enough to keep the upstairs sufficiently cooled in the summer, so nicely, they brought me a window unit to make it livable. This year however, I was told despite the precedent they set before, that they wouldn't be able to give me one again. The upstairs is a noticeable 7-8 degrees hotter now (April), and in the summer it can be as much as 10-15 degrees. Very dissapointed that the Retreat expects me to pay ~$400 for an AC to fix their houses poor design (I was given permission to purchase one, which I found laughable, considering I just want basic AC).\n\nAfter going to the leasing office ~10 times this year, I've had maybe one employee actually try to help me. Good luck talking to a manager and not a college student, the managers are miraculously always busy, no matter the time of day. The college students will look you straight in the face and tell you they'll have manager call you back, and it NEVER HAPPENS. I'm not sure if the students in front office don't care enough to actually reach out, or if management believes if they ignore you long enough you'll go away since you're \"just\" a college student. I've requested a statement from one of the managers in writing ~5 times. Every time I'm insured an email is forthcoming, and then, nothing.\n\nAlso, if you sign your lease a second time, it is hit or miss if they actually come by and fix anything. I called at least 7 times over the summer, asking them to come fix what was broken or messed up in the house, as they had done for all of our neighbors who resigned their leases, and yet again I was reassured over and over that they were on it, only to never come and leave us high and dry.\n\nI truly will never sign a lease again with the direction management has taken the Retreat this year. I only began having these problems this last year, my first year at the Retreat was great.\n\nEdited:Removing personal info, updating situations.\n\nUpdate: After finally working my way to management, they heard me out, while some concerns were taken care of, I'm still left with a bitter taste in my mouth after paying the high rent at the Retreat and being shafted as far as mid-summer clean-up goes.

Regarding the parties on property, our lease states that you are not allowed to have more than 15 people at your house at one time. This is to help keep the noise level to a minimum. With your issues with our security staff, the offer still stands if you would like to meet with our head of security. We have spoken to the head of security regarding your allegations. We are taking your concerns seriously, and are looking into the matter. If you do not turn your wristbands at the end of your lease, we do charge $25.00 per wristband. After reviewing your account, I do not see where you were charged for any move out fees or wristbands. I understand that you have maintenance issues in your house and I am looking forward to receiving your email and working on getting those issues resolved for you.

Much like all the other tempting amenities offered by the retreat its nothing more than a front.\nLet me not leave you with a review, but with a story.\nYour first day at the retreat. You wake up at 7:01 exactly. The peaceful sounds of 40,000 birds aggressively chirping outside your window mix perfectly with the sound of landscapers yelling as they mow your grass. You walk downstairs and prepare breakfast. As you\u2019re cleaning up after your meal you rejoice as you realize there is no garbage disposal. You load your dishes into the Ancient dishwasher and begin your five mile trek to the nearest garbage bin so that you can dispose of your trash. Now it\u2019s time for class. As you stop by the clubhouse to print off important documents for class you\u2019re informed for the 20th time that the printer isn\u2019t working. This works out perfectly because in order to get to campus from the distant retreat you must leave no later than 48 hours before the start of class. This leaves you plenty of time to find another printer. You return from class eager to finish your favorite show on Netflix. Luckily for you the last time the retreat updated their Wi-Fi was when my grandfather was shot in WWII. I cannot stress this enough. THE WIFI IS TERRIBLE. Instead you turn on TV and flip through the retreat tv package which has a total of 4 channels.  Fear not, the clubhouse had so many exciting activities when you signed the lease, right? Wrong. The golf simulator hasn\u2019t worked since the resurrection of Jesus and the gym smells like a dead cat. At least the pool is amazing right? It\u2019s great until they shut it down to \u201cdrain\u201d for two months in the summer. I am not kidding. They do it every. Single. Summer. A smart company would drain the pool in the fall and winter months  when no one would be there. Luckily for you, retreat management is no ordinary company. Now it\u2019s nightfall and you feel like going out to the bars or going to get drinks and dinner. Perfect, just snag an uber and avoid having to drive altogether. Ubering to the retreat from the strip is NO LESS THAN $15 dollars. EVER.\nPlease, please, please god don\u2019t live here. Management is terrible, they lie to you on your tours, and will fine the living daylights out of you on every monthly bill they can. Please, please, please live anywhere else.\n\nEDIT: you'll notice how management responded to my review without addressing the issue and again lying to residents. 1) I have pictures documenting landscaping crews beginning as early as 6:50 which actually violates noise ordinances. When I tried bringing this up with management I was ignored until I threatened to call the city and have you reported  2) You don't assist anyone with printing needs. I have had to bring my own paper on numerous occasions and the staff was not \"more than happy to assist\" 3) Your shuttle service is terrible and you pointing out its hours of operation don't make it anymore convenient. Thank you though! 4) I shouldn't have to pay a premium charge to upgrade my wifi. You should provide wifi that allows me to load youtube videos in less than 4 hours. 5) Your office staff makes it absolutely impossible to get in touch with anyone who can control fines and overages. Over winter break when NONE of my roommates were living in the house for 2.5 weeks we were billed $30 each. It took five days to contact management and the overages were quickly dropped.\nIf you spent more time helping residents and less time sarcastically responding to honest reviews people wouldn't have issues living there.\n\nSincerely,\nResident of 1.5 years", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1499265009012, "text": "Thanks Alex, for leaving us this response. We regret that you had a negative experience with us, but are glad you brought this to our attention. In May, we did offer pizza to all residents that left a google review, either positive or negative, to get more feedback from our current residents. Our landscaping crew begins work no earlier than 8 AM once a week on Mondays. We are very proud of the fact that all of our cottages come equipped with helpful appliances such as washers, dryers, and dishwashers for no additional charge. We are sorry that you found our centrally-located trash compactor to be inconvenient, but it is located near our gates, making it easy to drop off your trash on your way out of the property. On your way to class, you may stop by our clubhouse to use our computer lab that offers free printing! Occasionally, we do run out of ink for the printer, but we are more than happy to assist your printing needs at the office front desk. Additionally, our community is located less than 2 miles from The University of Alabama, just a short drive away from the East Commuter Lot! We also offer a Crimson Ride shuttle for our residents that runs every 30 minutes Monday-Friday from 7 A.M. to 9 P.M and can be tracked on Transloc. Our wi-fi and cable package that we offer our residents, free of charge, are through AT&T U-Verse. I do apologize that you found your wi-fi to be unsatisfactory, however our cable package offers over 550 channels. AT&T would be happy to upgrade your channels if you would like to pay a premium charge. Alex, we are also very excited to announce all of the great clubhouse updates that are currently under renovation. Our pool will be closed for around 4 weeks, depending on weather, and we will hopefully have it back open by the 4th of July. We will have a renovated free weight room, cardio room, study room, and yoga room! We also offer a late-night shuttle that drops off on The Strip by Little Italy Thursday night from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M., Friday night from 10 P.M. to 3 A.M., and Saturday night from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M. If you are ever unhappy with your overages, you may contact Conservice to receive the exact bill from Tuscaloosa Water and Alabama Power. If you have problems with any fines you may receive or any any other concerns at all, please feel free to come to our office, open 7 days a week, to discuss this further. Thanks again for your review!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8888a87d04974bd7:0x38be51afb9814d57"}

Anytime I would call to the office I would be told the manager is out, which I later was informed that the manager at the time, Kelly, would tell them \"she's out\" when in reality she didn't want to deal with situations. This is absolutely unprofessional management. Second off our house became infested with centipedes for 2 months.(dealt with same issues of having to request work orders). Last I was without cable for several months and payed for it and never received any money back and when the issue would be brought nothing would be done about it by the the retreat management.

I love even sitting on my couch with the blinds open and looking out of the window and hearing the birds chirping.\n2. These apartments are spacious. Kitchen is narrow, but there is lots of countertop space and cabinet storage space. I also have a coat closet, a pantry (probably supposed to be linen closet, but I put my food there), a walk-in laundry room and two huge bedroom closets. My bedroom is big enough for a king bed. The dining area is big enough for my parent's hand-me-down kitchen table and china cabinet.\n3. For the space you get, the price is right. They're always doing rent specials too, so be sure to ask management what the current special is. When I signed up, I got $300 off my first 3 months of rent, and I really needed that.\n4. Dog park! This complex is so dog-friendly, and my poodle loves the dog park. All of my friends want to meet me at my complex with their dogs so we can have puppy play dates.\n5. Pool and gym... they've been under construction, but they look awesome, and I can't wait to try them out.\n6. Community-wide wifi. It's fast and reliable, and because it's community-wide, it's way cheaper than if you set up wifi yourself.\n7. You can save up for apartment upgrades through their \"Dasmen points\" system. You get points for paying rent on time, referring a friend to move in, etc. Points can be redeemed for new shower head, new smart thermostat, or even a stainless steel appliance package for your kitchen.\n8. Super safe. I have walked laps around the community at 9-10 p.m. with no issues or fears.\n9. SUPER FRIENDLY staff! They all seem to know me and my dog by name. They always smile and wave when they see you. Very responsive via email.\n10. Very quiet.  The way the apartments are set up, my living room doesn't share a wall with any neighbors. So you're never kept up at night from a loud TV or music.\n\nMy only complaints...\n1. I'm not a fan of my carpet. My friend lives in a first floor unit \u2014 these have a beautiful vinyl plank flooring in the living room. But I was told that 2nd and 3rd floor units have carpet (for the sound barrier). I'm saving up for a nice rug to put in my living room.\n2. They have stands for doggy bags around the complex, but they're always empty. So not every resident cleans up after their pets.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHtTzlOVTxgRolO0K8qoxnEDPLHFdcr1_OqEWz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6TQRQoXawTQi5Tm9i86bthHWbapdojpd8sRhX=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg6TB-cV4BbWkHLe2UmPMNSRzbroyunQJI6-b-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUPVFZDU-JLTAjaae5M-O-9-PhiHTqb_eQIwHd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuCPv_ZKs-qXzUzaqsEENzAAsbjVm3R6MxkjkQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwU8P-u51yJJ9rHdq3ksVp1kHOnh0_eKj-DiTG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1598903153183, "text": "Thank you so much for taking the time to review our community.

I moved out over a year ago and they are still giving me problems. I lived in a one bedroom for a year and a half and a three bedroom for a year. The maintenance issues I experienced were almost unbelievable, from my hot water being out for two full weeks to kids stealing a pipe off the exterior wall and flooding my laundry room. Most issues were blamed on me as a tenant even though the problems were structural or with VSP equipment. Trying to get them fixed was a huge mess of red tape and constant reminders. Most amenities for which tenants are charged (pool, gym, etc) were not in working order most of the time (pre-COVID).

I could not say more positive things about this apartment. The management staff is very friendly and truly make you feel like you are at home. There are community events all the time for residents and the management staff know me by name each time I come in or reach out. The maintenance staff is very courteous and quick to resolve any issues (all of mine have been incredibly minor). I live in a one bedroom apartment and I always get compliments on how spacious it is - the space is very smartly laid out. I can fit a full queen bedroom suite in my bedroom which was difficult to find with one bedroom apartments. It is also the only apartment that I have found that actually had a dedicated laundry room rather than a washer and dryer unit being in the kitchen or bathroom. The only negative I would say on that is that technically it could fit a full sized washer and dryer but I went for a stackable unit so I wouldn't loose accessibility to the extra shelving in the laundry room. Closet space in this apartment is PERFECT and I actually have enough storage space (there is extra storage in the laundry room and two large closets in the bedroom). The community is very quiet and all of my neighbors are very friendly. As a single woman, safety is important to me, and I feel very safe in this community and have no reservations about taking my dog out at night.\n\nThe community is kind of tucked away but it is also very close to a neighborhood Wal Mart and gas stations as well as downtown Birmingham so you don't feel like you are too far away from anything.\n\nI would recommend this apartment to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547044298849, "text": "Hi Rebecca, thanks for the positive review!

I feel like they are trying to force me to stay against my will. I could understand if i was charged for 1-7 but not for the whole month and how can you force someone to stay somewhere they just don't want to not because of the property but because of management and the office staff.,CONTINUED on 7/17 So i got a 7 day notice and finally got a returned call back, I believe her name is Shannon, this was the same lady that I spoke with when i gave my 30 day notice the same lady that asked me to remove my last review, she really just tried to handle me!!!  she said they are starting the eviction process LADY I wanted to move 7/7/19 you kept me here (against my will just didn't want a negative mark on my credit so i complied) and said i would pay this month rent when I turn in my key because of lies and miscommunication she told me before I just cant trust anything she says at this point, so I agreed that I would pay July's rent in full when I'm moving out you know make one payment and be done, she told me \"that would not acceptable very RUDELY and because they are filing for an eviction I would have to pay the legal fees!!!! I'm sorry but if my memory serves me correctly I didn't want to stay here either!!! I've already paid my 1st month and security at my new house because I thought I would be out of this apartment on 7/7,  however that was not the case, I have no problem with paying my rent, again I've never had a late fee, never had a 7 day notice good tenant no complaints no nothing!!!I just do not trust the office staff so i would pay everything when i turned in the key I have the money to pay i just dont want them to say i owe anything else, Ive asked on several occasion to speak with someone higher then Shannon she says they are going to tell you the same thing, at this point I wouldn't personally  recommend this place to a fleas on a dogs balls, the apartments needs updates and lets not talk about how high your power bill is going to be because the heating and air conditions are older the Christ him self.

I lived in Unit 2735 A, a 3 bedroom, for one year.  The master bedroom was the worst bathroom with water periodically oozing out of floor coming from the pipes in the wall behind the toilet and sometimes from the toilet tank (which joins the kitchen on the other side, where the washing machine has to be located.  Black mold or rot of moulding  behind the wall where the water is.  NEVER FIXED.  THEY COME.  THEY DISTURB.  THEY MOP UP WATER.  THEY SAY FIXED.  IT'S NOT FIXED.  THEY CAME FIVE TIMES BEFORE IT STOPPED.  I DO BELIEVE THAT THE MAINTENANCE INCOMPETENT OR INTENTIONALLY PROVOKING EARLY RENT PAYING TENANTS BY NOT FIXING ISSUES.  THE THERMOSTAT FAN RUNS AND WILL NOT TURN OFF.  FOR THIS ISSUE I HAVE CALLED THREE TIMES.  BARRY HAS COME OUT THREE TIMES.  FINALLY, IT STILL BLOWS AND I HAVE TURNED OFF THE CIRCUIT BREAKER TO TURN FAN OFF.  THERE IS NO POOL.

BECAUSE WITHOUT A FULL RENOVATION, SOME OF THESE THINGS AREN'T A CHEAP FIX. I TRIED TO UPLOAD VIDEO OF THE ROTTING MOULDING EVERYWHERE BUT FOR SOME INTERESTING REASON, I CANNOT GET THE VIDEO LOADED.  I WILL UPLOAD PHOTOS SOON!  BY THE WAY, THEY CAME BY TODAY AND I STILL SEE FRESH WATER BEHIND THE TOILET!!!!! IT IS NEVER FIXED, YET YOU GET TO TAKE TIME OUT OF YOUR PRECIOUS TIME TO TALK ABOUT MAINTENANCE DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY, YET THEY COME OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

On the outside the apartments look nice and are in a good location (hence the two stars), but on the inside they are a complete disaster. To begin with, when I first moved in all the stainless steel appliances they boasted about were not yet fully assembled. When I first opened up the oven and dishwasher I was shocked to find pvc pipes, tubes, and screws just sitting inside them. Also half the light fixtures were without bulbs. I thought maybe they didn\u2019t have the place fully set up yet and called and they fixed it after a few days. Without a working oven at first and having just moved to a new town, I went out and got some microwave dinners... that\u2019s when I found shock number two. If the TV and living room lights are on and you use the microwave for longer than 60 seconds the power shorts out. They had an electrician come look at it and he told me the wiring was all done wrong and there was nothing he could do. Still to this day I only microwave in thirty second increments to avoid having to use the flashlight on my phone to find the breaker box and reset the power. The next issue I found was that the apartment is on a slant and the floors are uneven. So I had to completely rearrange the furniture in my room to keep the drawers in my chest from sliding out or my TV from being dangerously close to tipping over. The next issue was the plumbing... still to this day from time to time after having had it \u201cfixed\u201d three times all the sinks and tub in my apartment will randomly start filling from the bottom up with dirty water. My neighbor tells me it\u2019s done the same for him too. It\u2019s disgusting and I refuse to take baths and only shower because of it. Also when the Neighboor uses his food disposal the gunk starts pouring in from the bottom up on my side... a nasty surprise to have when cooking diner in the kitchen. And another major issue I had was there was no functioning cable connection when I arrived. The cable wire had been cut out of the wall by the construction crew. Charter made me get written permission from the complex to instal a new one, which took ages to get. My installation fee and labor fee came to  $83, and the complex refused to pay more than $30 because that was their \u201cpolicy\u201d, despite having promised functioning cable connections in the rent agreement. I could go on about issues in my apartment forever, but I\u2019ll stick to those main issues. The next problem I want to warn any future residents about is that the complex is misleading when saying they have a gym and self laundry service. The laundry room is under construction and has been since summer so is completely closed, and the gym was turned into a storage room \u201ctemporarily\u201d for several months now as well so is closed too. The pool didn\u2019t open until mid summer and would only be open a few hours on certain days, which apparently the office didn\u2019t know because several times I called to see if it was open before going only to pack everything and get down there to find it chained up with a big closed sign on it. Also the trash valet service is a mandatory $15/month fee, and they only pick up your trash after it\u2019s been sitting out for days. Oh and  the \u201ccafe\u201d is a kerig set up in the main office lol. Which gets me to the main office... good luck dealing with them. Management has turned over hands three times in the year I have lived here. Nobody ever knows what is going on and you get different answers from different people. Not to mention their hours are constantly changing, they will take one and two hour lunch breaks, and they close frequently for the most random of holidays I\u2019ve ever heard of. So good luck if you work a full time job trying to find a time when you are off and they are open to pick your packages up. I would not recommend this apartment complex.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543349224918, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to give us a review. We are sorry to hear we missed the mark.

We then moved to Vestavia Place, The water bugs was awful the grounds was not kept and I had to make a police report agent the downstairs neighbor for Threatened me and my grandchildren several times, Although I was not afraid I decided to let the Law handle it, and she was evicted.\n\nThe  staff including the management team as changed more then five times in 15 months there is always new staff. The pool and workout room and Laundry room was closed all summer, and never once have they offered the residence any kind of prorated rent for our inconvenience, Our Apartment has several  internal and external problems  . When it rain it rains inside our kitchen and Mater Bathroom we have to put buckets in both rooms to catch the rain I have videos of the rain coming in. All the floors are cracked underneath the carpet , they have sent several floor guys in and each of them stated the floors need to be redone throughout the entire Property being they are over fifty years old, so when walking through the Apartment I can feel and hear the cracked floor. The leaves are never removed they just blow them onto the grass so we never have beautiful green grass its leaves and dirt everywhere, I had to request for them to repair the Hallway Bathroom the flooring was lifting up molding around the tub was coming off all the vents throughout the unit was full of dust it was nasty my husband and I had to do most of the deep cleaning to even move in, They had promised new appliances at move in instead they had old discoloring Mitch matched stove and refrigerator there, after a couple of weeks they finally replaced them.\n\nWhen we moved in we had ATT after the second week they told us we couldn't use ATT every resident must have Spectrum, so we were penalized  for breaking our ATT contract. Spectrum service are so awful everyday between 6pm and 9pm the internet works like a dial up service because so many people are logged on at once in this area. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse  Vestaia Place/ Mountain Lodge Apt had Spectrum come in and rewire every united, Throughout December their has been strange men six or more walking through my home. Once I woke up to them in my Living room saying they was Spectrum yes the Apartment Manager had gave out everybody Apartment keys for these strangers to enter each united.

Because I have not been so fortunate to experience any of the great things they are referencing.\n\nI'm sure Josh is a kind and hard worker (never met him), but that does not make actually living in this apartment complex a pleasant experience.\n\nI have lived here for just over a year and this has by far been my worst residential experience.\n\nThe rennovations within these units were very poorly done. I look around in my apartment and feel as though this place could fall apart at any moment.\n\nThe plumbing within these units is also terrible. I have completed countless maintenance requests for no resolve. I have also been asked to no longer use the shower in my bedroom, because it causes a leak in the apartment below me.\n\nMaintenance has even come to cut a portion of a wall out to resolve plumbing issues. I never got a completion notice and the wall was never repaired.\n\nYou should also be prepared for the water within the complex to be turned off without notice, for repairs that could take hours.\n\nThe HVAC System also works poorly and the age of this unit causes it to be quite drafty so expect high utilities expense.\n\nThe keys to my apartment somehow were \"misplaced\" by the leasing office. I was not informed by the leasing office, but by maintenance men when they came and knocked on my door asking for a copy of my key.\nIt was very difficult to take this up with anyone in the leasing office, because the turn over here is crazy. Very rare that I've walked into this office and seen the same face twice. (HUGE RED FLAG IN TERMS OF SAFETY FOR RESIDENTS)\n\nThe walls are very thin... You'll hear EVERYTHING your neighbors are doing and the outdoors areas are not kept clean.\n\nPlease also be prepared for whatever goes down your neighbors kitchen sink/garbage disposal because it will come up through yours and the smell is deathly.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on...\n\nMy suggestion: Before you stop into the leasing office, I suggest you drive through this complex and take a good hard look before they glaze you over with things that sound awesome and show you model apartments that would not actually stand up to everyday living.\n\nAlso, read EVERY review!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539106463454, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to review our community.

We have maintence staff who are friendly and professional while in your home. Issues are usually handled in a reasonable time with some exceptions.\n\nThe seclusion and peace that my little peace of heaven offers is worth giving this place a look if you are in the market for a good stepping stone. I would not suggest this place for long-term living. The high turn over of office staff will make your head spin and there are more than a few foundational issues in the buildings themselves. There was a remodeling project started last summer that has yet to be completed.\n\nI do feel the pool is safe enough during the summer to allow my little ones to splash around and have been graced with a few great neighbors in my particular building. I don't really venture out beyond that. I also appreciate that this is a dog friendly complex. The complex is kind of cut out of and into a wooded area so the dogs get the run of the few grass areas available, but are kept completely clear ofhe toddler-friendly play area. t\n\nThe gym is figureprint monitored which makes me feel safe when I'm in there early mornings or late nights alone. I never feel afraid to walk the complex at night because of the on-site officer and the pleasant people your run in to sometimes.\n\nThis place does certainly have its pros and cons. And there have been some extremely horrible office staff and management. Also, beware of the water bill. That is the only utility issue that has yet to be addressed since I moved in (2016- present) and the bill climbs higher every two months with no explaination.\n\nI've been able to raise a family here and I don't regret my choice, but I would not suggest spending more than 3 years here AS-IS.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539051767160, "text": "Thanks for the awesome review!

I usually am not one to leave bad reviews but quite frankly I\u2019m surprised this place is still in business. I am currently a student at Auburn University; my mom and I moved into Kenley apartment complex back in January of 2020. Before we moved in there were many problems, the air conditioner was leaking, the towel bar fell out of the wall, the bathroom door would not lock, the shower faucet was broken, paint dripping down the cabinets, paint specs all over the floor, hot water was not attainable, very little water pressure, and a few other minor things. The lady at the front desk was very nice and told us she would have maintenance come fix everything before we moved in. She bold-face lied! A few weeks go by and maintenance never showed up so my mom logged a service request... maintenance comes in and fixed the problems temporarily, but the problems weren\u2019t permanently fixed. The air conditioner still continues to leak and it will go out atleast 3 times a week. We have called the office many times and no one seems to ever answer. We have continued to log service requests and maintenance will show up, half way do the job, promise to have the maintenance supervisor come back and inspect, but he never shows back up. This is a recurring problem since January and it is now June? It has now been over 5 months and my mom and I have just learned to get on our hands and knees with buckets and empty the water pan out ourselves every time the air goes out. One problem seems to lead to another and management ignores it. There is now mold in my closet from water leaking from the air conditioner into the wall and my bathroom faucet still is not fixed. Taking a shower has been miserable for the past 5 months and this is supposed to be a \u201cluxury\u201d apartment. The gates to the apartment are broken and it\u2019s been that way for a while so anyone can get in and it\u2019s no longer safe.  This whole complex is a fire hazard with broken smoke detectors. Maintenance went to the apartment above me and soaked everything on my back porch and not to mention the whole complex smells like weed and cigarettes; so if you don\u2019t like the smell of weed and cigarette smoke coming through your air vents,\nthat sucks because you just have to deal with it. Parking here is RIDICULOUS. Sometimes I work late and there is no where to park, so I have parked on the curb because guest parking was also full. I received a tow warning, so I called the office, no answer as usual.  I went to the office myself and talked to management about it, asking where I should park. The lady says \u201cThere are spots all over this complex\u201d, I asked where and she points to the complete opposite side of the complex about 1/2 of a mile from where I live. I walk by myself at 11pm sometimes to get back to my apartment in complete darkness, because community exterior lighting doesn\u2019t exist. Oh, and getting back to parking; don\u2019t even try to have a guest over because there basically is no guest parking; so if you give someone a guest parking pass \u201cthat is no longer active\u201d they will get a $375 towing charge like my friend did. There must be an illegal racquet going on because what kind of apartment complex would squeeze out and purposefully short parking spaces, then have your cars towed in the middle of the night? Kenley must be receiving a kick-back! SHAME! Also, the employees in the office are extremely rude and don\u2019t care about anything!! Everyone around me has started to move out because management is so terrible.  Living here has been absolute HELL and my mom is paying $1125/month which is supposed to include valet trash service. To no avail, the trash compactor doesn\u2019t work either & valet trash service gets \u201ccancelled several times a week. They are charging $25 a month for something that doesn\u2019t exist 1/2 the time!! How is this legal? This is NOT right and many tenants are moving out of this hell-hole!

We love our apartment and enjoy the staff and maintenance team but the amenities advertised are not functional and is a disappointment. The fire pits do not work, the hot tub jets do not work, the golf course no longer exists, the dog park is over run with feces, the dog clean up stations do not have bags in them and haven't had any since we moved in 3 months ago, (dog feces is everywhere on this property), the fitness cardio equipment in the gym is in need of serious maintenance and repair and do not work properly, initially we had to use the laundry room when we first got here and the dryers took three cycles to dry and need maintenanced,  the tv in the tv sitting/meeting room doesnt work, the lights on the tennis courts do not work, the gate was broken for the first fews months we were here but its fixed now however there is a nice guard shack for extra security but its not used or staffed, most of the gas grills in the pic nic areas do not work, spectrum internet was supposed to be in the buildings in October but its January and there's been no communication updates...apparently you cant run hot water and your heat at the same time, you have to pick one, so either a hot shower and cold apartment or a warm apartment and a cold shower because of the systems in these apartments, we spent alot of time in the fall cleaning litter from the lake, streams, and trails because trash piles up and blows out of cans into the lakes and surrounding grounds....we are hoping its just because 2020 was a pandemic year and things had to be overlooked and maybe in 2021 things will be repaired and made functional again but if you're looking for the luxury thats advertised I would check on these things before sigining your lease, gwr property management company doesn't seem very professional or interested in maintaining a luxury property as they advertise at the moment... we hope it gets better in the spring/summer..we love the staff and our physical unit but hope gwr management does plan to eventtually maintain and up keep what they advertise as reasons why people should move here and live here...I know this sometimes mean upper management has to equip the on site staff better so we are hoping and optimistic to see better care in the spring/summer since we've only been here 3 months", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1609774827549, "text": "Our apologies, Karen.

I have been a traveling man for over 30 years in my line of work. I have seen, visited, and stayed at many locations during this time. I have came and made residency at the kenley A few years back. I was and still am a man who likes to read the reviews and research things of this nature especially where I will be staying. The oldest saying in the book is you can\u2019t please everyone. Well let me say this again I have stayed at many locations throughout the country and the staff here at the kenley  has been outstanding and I have been for the most part very pleased with my living quarters in how they are ran. I will say maintenance in apartment complex is one of the hardest things to maintain but once again hands-down Kinley has shown that they are at the top of the chart on maintaining and keeping their residence happy. I also know in the apartment industry you will have always have something to fix in maintenance but I do thank their office personnel and the maintenance crew for all their hard work that they do. Thank you for doing your part to help me enjoy my home here at the Kinley. I would absolutely recommend the Kinley to be a future home for anyone. Again over 30 years of traveling in and out of apartments the Kenley is by far a 10 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1f.\nThanks fo all kenley", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605712336276, "text": "Thanks for your feedback, Ronald.

However problems still remain. \u2014 ORIGINAL: I moved here more than a year ago. Overall I\u2019m happy but there are some major downsides in my opinion: the internet service here is TRASH. The ISP they use is overpriced, the connection is unreliable and drops out all the time so forget uninterrupted streaming or gaming, and the ISP\u2019s customer service is the worst I\u2019ve ever experienced for ANY company. The management at Kenley has been promising to get a new ISP for about 6 months but no results yet. If it actually happens my rating will change.\n\nAnother downside: the front gate has been broken for about 4 months and vehicle break ins have increased as a result. Yet I\u2019m still paying the same rent for a complex that\u2019s less safe. How does that work?\n\nAlso maintenance has been an issue for me. I think this is more of an understaffing issue than anything else: When the maintenance guys do show up they do a professional job but It requires multiple phone calls, even to the \u201cemergency\u201d maintenance line to get anyone to respond.\n\nMy A/C stops working once every 4-5 weeks during the summer months and every time it\u2019s required multiple phone calls to get anyone to show up. Even in the middle of August. The longest I waited was over 48 hours in a 90 degree apartment on the weekend I moved in.\n\nAnother small complaint, the front office hours are inconvenient. They are open 9-6, M-F so if you work a normal 9-6 M-F job you have to take your lunch break to come and pick up any delivery packages that were left in the office for you.\n\nAlso, the fee they charge for making online rent payments is over $30 EACH time. So if you plan on paying your rent online make sure you have the budget to spend nearly $400 every year to cover that.\n\nOn the PLUS side, the property is beautiful, they have great amenities , the management is usually responsive and communicative about issues and events happening around the complex, there\u2019s \u201cFood Truck Friday\u201d, it\u2019s generally a nice and quiet place to live.\n\nHowever they do need to improve some things or I will definitely not be renewing my lease or recommending them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596226928232, "text": "Hello Jack.

It is always such a pleasure to work with genuine people who can empathize with others.\n\nBecause of the fact that she has gone far above and beyond anything than I ever expected, I'm giving the new organization a much better review and rating.\n\nThe way that my problem was resolved was both quick, courteous, and professional.

I was robbed 3 times, my car vandalized, and the grove themselves took money that i gave no authorization for them to take.  Management likes to play dumb when you confront them about problems, and when you start pressing them hard about it, they become a bunch of smart mouths towards you.  Nothing about the grove is appealing, you're better off living in your vehicle than living at the grove.  Its horribly unsafe.  I watched someone stabbed outside my window 2 weeks into living there, cops showed up 20min after i called them.  My neighbor was robbed at knife point and her car stolen.  One of my roommates had his car stolen the other was in our apartment when someone kicked the door in and robbed him at knife point and stole everything he had and anything i had in the living room.  They hit you with fake charges and force you to pay them.  The place is dirty, and loud at night and cops wont do a darn thing if you call them.  I've been moved out for a while now, and im still having to deal with the idiots of grove management.  Spare yourself what I went through and still going through.

In my case, it is only $455/month, because it is my second year here since a $30 cheaper rent was an incentive to sign for another year, six months early.  Often times, in my experience, the occupancy level is below capacity; My unit only has two of us, and my roommate is moving out at the end of this month, while I happen to be looking for someone to take my lease because I am doing a leave of absence from school.  The free internet and basic cable have been nice.  I don\u2019t know if phone service is free or not because I just use my 688,9377 non-Mobile mobile (480) number.

Sad!\nWhile this is not a terrible or unsafe place to live, it's that borderline between upper lower class and lower working class. As a consequence, there is a wide array of persons\nthat end up living here. Though you have some\nvery respectful neighbors, unfortunately you\nalso run the risk of having absolute jerks as\nneighbors. While one can make the argument\nthat any apartment complex is going to have that\nissue, it does seem to be a bigger issue here since\nthere is that wide discrepancy in socio-economic\nincome here. I will break this review down into\nthree categories: Price, amenities, and overall\nexperience.\nPrice: Not everybody pays the same amount. I'm\nnot talking about the different levels of pay for\nwhichever floor. For instance, you're going to pay\na higher price on the bottom floor while paying a\nlesser price on the third floor. What I am referring\nto is the cost of an apartment vs. What's your\nneighbor might be paying. In one case, a neighbor\nwas paying around $60 less per month than I was.\nThis was based off the fact that when they signed\ntheir lease the rent was lower. Unfortunately, what\nthat means is that when your lease runs out, you\nautomatically get moved to month to month. But\nunless you ask, you're not going to know whether\nor not the rent has fluctuated up or down. It's nice\nto go month-to-month after a year lease is up but it\nwould also be nice to know what the current going\nrate for the rent is so if I wanted to re-sign a lease\nfor a lower rate I could. The reason I won't mention\nrent amount though is that I don't know what\nthe current going rate is and I don't want to give\nincorrect information.\nAmenities: they don't have much. There is no other\nway to put. The workout room is nearly unusable\nbecause it's so small, it does have a fairly nice pool\nunfortunately it is not as clean as it should be. I have\nfound everything from cigarette butts to pieces of\nbroken glass in and around the pool. I can't blame\nthe apartment complex property manager for this,\nsince they are not the ones who did it, but I feel like\nit should be cleaned on a more regular basis. There\nis a playground on the property but it's basically\nfalling apart and the feral cats that live in the area\nuse the sand as their litter box so it's pretty gross.\nOn the plus side, you do have free internet and\ncable and you don't have to pay for water. While\nthe Internet isn't super fast, it's pretty darn good\nfor something you're not paying for. Not always\nsuper reliable but you can stream on it without too\nmuch of an issue as long as you're not trying to\nwatch HD video. There are three dumpsters on site\nbut unfortunately a lot of trash blows around the\napartment complex because people have trouble\nthrowing their trash into the dumpsters. I want saw\nan old man on his scooter picking up trash because\nhe couldn't take it anymore. It's a problem that got\nworse the longer I lived there. Maintenance is also\na small problem. This apartment complex is well\nover 10 years old now and is starting to show the\nsigns and problems that an older complex going to\nhave. Unfortunately, the owners of this apartment\ncomplex won't hire more maintenance workers so\nthe one guy they have on staff is WAY overworked!\nGreat guy and very helpful, but I wouldn't want his\njob because he has way too much on his plate\nOverall experience: Would I recommend this\napartment complex to someone? That's a hard\nquestion to answer. If you can afford to spend\ncloser to the $1,000 mark, I would suggest\nfinding a different apartment complex. They are\nunderstaffed (don't get me started about whether\nor not they'll be someone in the office on any given\nday) and it's not the cleanest", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe3PgThOrKrkHdY9IUms99_nJtGHutBSp9CLyj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeqj0Q6Nsp_nWmHCqsK6N1cDyoVnP9ValCtNDC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaSX3o39YLWkDQeYJIJsduBXLBw577e9e2Kx72=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMc_uNoAKawOnfVB-pIMj-jOvPb669kcmQqmkSm=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3nW5ZYzzxR504FZk0LhI9aVP6RUzSOnqaQAJE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpdwWE-ykrGwx1SbTUcpt3cXrO0irnM9kWzlhT=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVhDS5Bkuz13bK0cib5eorGFT_SGZOggju55S5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2tN7dlu-JIES8AsKZZKyiWqqnOqLxKU_e9TKu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBa2UjbnoAWfpdMsGqJHYU48sJoVMb3TwSXYC8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy3ffATm46ahg5iG0gQMxrsOPlApQJ6xXpt6FG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnCkU_h43bL6L0Fdb4Fv7khsOIV8GUroJvao0h=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFhUH_p8GxxwVixkze6n3r8WOKEmrYRhRjf2lE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvQ7fXeBarxpqWWtpnXj82djHwHl9tEmgs0VPA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7v9b6xdgmk5DDGBzy4zy39wrTltQW4oJDUEK5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxK7RczzmMYWs3LIz8r4zYipvfp1laik-lvt1p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt81JjW59vKdPQyS9aB1zuTe3ODd_KnO25hmIW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0d111xLh1IQ3XYcL_ECP-7U7wcdFTtsR4dsv6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1597152143360, "text": "Thank you for your review!

When we found out we were moving to this area, my husband and I spent at least 5-6 months searching and over-analyzing every apartment complex between Phenix City, AL and Columbus, GA. During that time I found myself constantly disappointed with the results I was getting. Apartments were either grossly overpriced, extremely particular about the potential ferociousness of our lovable Boxer puppy, or too good to be true. The apartments we thought were perfect ended up being full of problems (which we discovered through reviews like this), so I had no other option but to try and accept the fact that we were going to have to settle for two years of car break-ins, obnoxious neighbors, and bugs infestations.\n\nThat was until I stumbled upon Windsweep Luxury Apartments. You WILL NOT find this level of quality for such an affordable price. We have lived here for several months now, and for once in my life I have ZERO complaints (can't you tell I'm quite the ray of sunshine?). The manager, Erica, is phenomenal at what she does. I have worked in customer service for years (including management) and I can tell you from a professional standpoint that she is someone that any business would be lucky to have. Nowhere else will you find a property manager that remembers each of their tenants' names, and genuinely cares for the people around them.\n\nThe apartments are beautiful, the maintenance workers are great, incredibly prompt, and polite, the neighborhood is quiet, and the overall atmosphere is just great. I could go on and on about Windsweep.\n\nDo yourself a favor and check this place out.

She said we only had 72 hours (which she never informed us of) but regardless we went out there twice and called dozen of times within those 72 hours and never got ahold of anybody.
