Be careful if you have insurance; once I brought up that my insurance might cover the work, the owner got really shady and kept telling me that it wasn't a good idea to contact my insurance company.

When I finally got the owner on the phone, he protested that the job would cost me about $6,000, but calling around and showing the invoice to other mechanics in the area, they told me they would do the same job for about $4,000.

I told her I would and gave her a quote of 70 dollars to do both. When I started the Job around 2 oclock I found that  someone had taken a big tube of glue and poured it all over the inner mounting guts of the mirror assembly to glue it back on the car, this was not told to me when I gave her a estimate.  I tried contacting her and was un able to , then she showed up at four when I was just finishing her mirror , but hadn't changed her oil yet and told her that I wouldn't have time now to change it , but showed her and her boyfriend the extra work I had to do to save the wires safely getting the connectors apart and getting the mounting screws out without hurting the heads   because of the glue mess someone had made. Her car was also suppose to go to the window tint shop in the morning at 10:00am but she failed to get it there on time and by 10:30 Anthony had to leave and told her her car would now not be done that day he had other jobs he had to do first since she missed her appointment , but she could leave it and he would have it done tomorrow morning she was nasty pushed on getting it done that day then said forget it , then called him back and said ok. The job calls for an hour of labor I ended up spending 2 hours because of the glue and charged her for 1 hour and this is what she thinks she can do to repay the favor and on top of it her they only paid me 50 dollars and I just let it go! P/s she also quoted this was her second time using me and the fact is this was the first time. She bought her car from a used car lot and I was asked to do some repairs on it from the dealer , but never did the work.

They were very friendly and honest and the vehicle was just as described except for one minor issue.  I had been told it had a new battery, but during inspection we discovered that the battery was not new. It was just a mix-up and they were happy to install a new battery while we were finishing up the financial side of the deal.  Would have loved to have gotten the car at a bit lower price (who wouldn't?) but this was an exceptional low-mileage one-owner specimen, and they did work with me on the price.  I've shopped Miatas for quite some time and lately Carvana seems to have almost cornered the market on clean low-mileage Miatas and have jacked the prices up really high.  But I was able to buy this Miata well below what Carvana would have priced it at, and I feel that I got a good deal considering the current market and the premium condition of this vehicle  (and lots of buyers have had very bad experiences with Carvana, so I'm glad I didn't have to deal with them).

You should look it up. With that said here is our reply to your review.\nI am sorry you are having an issue after the repair but an engine replacement is just that, the engine along with any extra parts that we felt were questionable and they are listed on your invoice. There is not an ECM on your invoice. Please keep in mind that there are several other things under the hood of your car that can also cause future problems. Unfortunately we are not able to detect a component such as an ECM, starter, alternator, Oxygen Sensor, Injector and so on that is about to go bad, it is just impossible. Your vehicle is 11 years old and does have 175,000 miles on and usually parts and components will begin to fail and need replacing after 10 years. This ECM is not covered under warranty because we did not replace this part and it does not come with an engine. I have copied and pasted some information for you that came from a site called my mechanic explaining the ECM\u2019s function to your car. We have ordered the ECM, as you know, and as soon as it is installed and the car is test drove we will call you.\nHere is some information that I pulled from the site \"My Mechanic\" that may help you better understand an ECM's function.\nThe engine control module (ECM), also commonly referred to as the engine control unit (ECU) or powertrain control module (PCM), is one of the most important components found on virtually all  vehicles. It essentially functions as the main computer for many of the vehicle\u2019s engine performance and drivability functions. The ECM takes the information from the engine's various sensors and uses that information to calculate and tune engine spark and fuel for maximum power and efficiency. Erratic engine behavior also indicates a bad or failing ECM. A faulty computer may cause the vehicle to intermittently stall or misfire. The symptoms might come and go and not appear to have any sort of pattern to their frequency or severity. The ECM plays a vital role in engine performance. Any issues with it can cause major problems with the overall functionality of the car."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888e1ecf9f042b3:0x2b83686c18294477"}

My P30 Step Van was towed in to get a refreshing and almost had to be towed away. I heard their ad on the radio, gave them a call and found out they service Cintas vans. I spoke to the owner Matt on the phone and he assured me that he was the place to come to and he would take care of me. I told him what I wanted done, I also left a list with the most important to be taken care of first (fuel tank leak and master cylinder replacement) with the receptionist. I mentioned new tires but didn\u2019t decide what to install, but he did, and installed them without my consent. Later he said he thought that\u2019s what I wanted \u201cthe cheap ones.\u201d He decided to do what he wanted and void my concerns (that I spoke of on every visit). I was charged over $400.00 in parts (radiator, v belt and lug nuts) plus labor @ $74/hour added without my consent nor were they spoken of when I made payments in person. I was charged ($35.00) for an air cleaner that he had left from a previous vehicle and promised that he wouldn\u2019t charge me for since I was getting so much work done. That Monday of week three, I stopped by to realize no work had been done over the past 5 days and I immediately stopped the work and told them I would be back in the morning to pick up and pay off balance. Next morning I waited over and hour for the motor to be pressure washed like he promised it would be done yesterday by lunch. While waiting he then decided that he would for free replace the master cylinder and patch the fuel tank leak with a $6.00 putty instead of replacing the tank like I asked on day one. All while repairs being done there were no actual receipt/list of parts and labor but guesstimations made until I made final payment. After I reviewed the receipt just before I paid the remaining $1,400+ balance I had to request that Matt break down and fix the double charges on receipt (I was so angry that I missed a few issues on the receipt). A week turned into a month and if I had not stopped the work there\u2019s no telling how long it would have taken to get the van back. Now I\u2019m weeks behind schedule on preparing for the van for body work and getting it wrapped.   The total cost was $3,863.68 and $1,417.25 of it was labor. I felt robbed and played.

I removed the water pump that weekend to find they cross threaded the new water pump and warped the unit. No wonder it did not function properly. After re-tapping a couple of screws and several hours out of my Saturday I replaced the new pump myself. Now I am out the price of another water pump, thanks a lot.\n\nMany people do not know this, but each repair job has an attached amount of time associated with it. So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either. Basically the repair guy did not remove all the necessary components (like a radiator) to save some time and shoved the water pump in at an angle.\n\nI will never use them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn. Griffin said he was sorry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}
