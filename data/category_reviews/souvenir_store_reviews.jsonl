I really think it was the best cheeseburger that I've ever had.... the french fries were those 'crinkle' kind and were so good... not one bit greasy.  Our food was ready very quickly, and everyone there was so nice and friendly.  Don't pay any attention to that poster who only gave it a one star.  It seems as though they were there during the World's Longest Yard Sale which brought so many people to the area, and they must have been swamped.  That is only once per year...... it's not a typical occurrence for them to be slow.

The receipt has Rose as the cashier.  I told her that we were just looking.  My husband, 15 year old autistic son, and I were browsing.  As we walked around we noticed that she was following me through the store.  Keep in mind we were the only black customers in the store.  She approached me again.  I told her that I did not need any help again.  I never saw her ask any one else if they needed help.  I began to feel very uncomfortable and I told my husband that I wasn't buying anything.   He said why because she keeps following you around.  I said yes.  I walked out.  He proceeded to purchase a plaque for a friend of ours who is fighting cancer.  He told her that she didn't have to follow us around we have money.  She never once apologized.   I will never shop here ever again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559660869175, "text": "Hey Angela, I am so sorry about your terrible experience. No one deserves to be treated that way.
