Tacky floral furniture and all. But I got the opposite! My 5 friends and I walked into a huge kitchen with granite countertops and an island. The tile floor was so pretty, the furniture and living room rug was something I\u2019d put into my own home. The dining room table was very nice and had amazing leather chairs. The decor was great and not at all what I expected! (Aka the typical try too hard beach house and overwhelming floral) Checking in was a breeze and I even made the mistake of not remembering the time difference and arrived an hour early. I texted the manager and told them about my mistake and got a response that our room was ready for us to check in early. The communication was impeccable and I was impressed. The master bedroom had a king bed and we still had plenty of room to unload our suitcases. The bathroom in the master had a great walk in shower. The other 2 bedrooms were very spacious and clean. The best part about this entire trip is how SPOTLESS the entire condo was. I expected to have black feet walking around barefoot as that seems to be the usual beach condo thing. I checked my feet daily and was amazed! All the girls including myself kept bragging about how nice and clean our little home away from home was. I\u2019ve told family and friend back home to rent this condo next time they visit the beach! STAY AT THIS CONDO!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07b932f5a01f:0x1dd3374b47a2a5a3"}

She constantly stayed in contact with me and the seller with updates. She even helped me negotiate with the seller by sharing her past experiences and things she seen be negotiated as a realtor. I got a very good deal thanks to her. It only took 22 days to make this deal and close after I selected my house. I don't know much about real estate but as the buyer I am completely satisfied.

After spending three months in quarantine, we decided to take a road trip to Lake Martin.  My great aunt and uncle owned a home there when I was a child and I have very fond memories of our lake adventures.  In July 2020, we rented a house to escape the \"new norm\" and after spending one long weekend on the lake, we set out on a new adventure - house hunting.\n\nI wanted a Realtor who was up-to-date on market conditions and knew the area well, so I took a chance and reached out to the president of the local Realtor association.  That was Jimmy Baker, broker/owner of Lake Dog Realty.  He was responsive, knowledgeable and most of all patient.  In a hot market, with extremely limited housing inventory fueled by record low interest rates, multiple offers is a given.  We looked at over 25 properties in 8 months, and finally....the stars aligned.  Our offer was accepted on \"THE ONE!\"  Our family now owns a little piece of heaven to relax and enjoy time together.\n\nThank you, Jimmy and Kim, for all of your assistance.

Jimmy and I spoke on the phone and that's how he and I started working together.\n\nI had a pretty good idea of what I could afford and I had previously owned a few homes over the past 10 years. From the first time he and I met I knew he was the best realtor that I had worked with. He was always punctual, polite and wanting to get to know me beyond just what kind of house I wanted.\n\nHe explained everything to me, every step of the way and never once made me feel like a question I had was silly. He never once gave me the run around or didn't call me back. That's Jimmy, he's incredibly easy to get a hold of and he's incredibly caring about his clients.\n\nSo, after seeing a few houses he helped me settle on one that I was really interested in. Now, in less than 72 hours, I'll be closing on my first house for myself.\n\nJimmy, his wife and his business partner John are without a doubt the ideal people you want to work with when looking for a new home. It's not all about his commission or the money, they each really do care about you as a person.\n\nThere may be a lot of agents in the area but I swear you won't find an agency like Lake Dog anywhere. These people care about their clients and they treat them like family.\n\nTo Jimmy, his staff, John.... Thank you for getting me the house of my dreams.

Appears that one of their own property managers left a five-star review.  And four of their five-star reviews come from people with the last name Hayley, same as the owner. (Maybe it's a coincidence!) It's almost funny.\n\nRead through these reviews and you'll notice a trend that explains Hayley's poor ratings everywhere: they start with poor quality and end with scamming you out of your deposit. My pregnant wife and I spent 3+ hours on our hands and knees scrubbing our rental house top to bottom before we moved out. It was far cleaner than when we moved in. We discovered $100+ was kept from our deposit because we \"didn't have it professionally cleaned\" -- which is not even a requirement of the lease. I provided photographic evidence that we cleaned up messes that Hayley had never addressed when we moved in, proving that we left the place cleaner than Hayley did. (See photos below for before and after.) Their lawyer said our photos were selective and that we were \"belittling\" their efforts -- says the person who penalized a pregnant woman for cleaning 3+ hours. Nor did Hayley specify what we failed to clean, much less photographic evidence to prove it. All this to say that Hayley appears to automatically deduct $100+ from deposits for cleaning yet doesn't use that fee to clean the place to their own supposed standards.\n\nThis was just the last of many frustrations. Ants and roaches were present when we moved in. Here too we picked up for Hayley's slack and hired exterminators. Hayley's lease requires tenants to maintain the yard but when we moved in, we discovered the yard filled with bamboo and 1+ foot of pine straw (no wonder there were bugs). We asked Hayley to fix it; they sent a maintenance crew that cut the bamboo and left everything else. I spent all week raking it up.\n\nFinally, the property was quite literally rotting on the outside. (Again, no wonder there were bugs.) The owner clearly was attempting to put as little maintenance into the property as possible. I think Hayley is coasting on the Auburn housing market, but it won't take much for a competitor to pick up their slack.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvN2eQVtoi0SQGAcfy6tyL1GD7aSxMtFDS5nyR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSfYxcEl8eRiaOGP1OssoaPdCvsGHf96xhNusd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvQ7HCQqySLqwzzIj8c6iqas_rXgF4NpKj9L1j=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtSfISquaxR8YozlqLVBOYJ2IUaUhwzaAYLeer=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSw48agcU-r-6MKBgRiTUjkbWGuV3PWYknDcww=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9hJgmOGevlVyoSahL4BQ_deo6QZn3dgaSywZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBklQXQranYZFILQmYpaAMjIxW1vyCfFpNfWYZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzAOK_yUoBfVrwwsLXa9E_3ZhjPWJLrS4lTy7U=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8VVTgat3HNyRvPJzk4vn_CiHKXSqBNHgsBTQA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

We had insurance, if they had informed us how bad the leak and water damage was we would have contacted them to come in. Instead two years later we have reports from an environmental mold specialist ongoing us that the upstairs and room beneath where water leaked is covered in black mold.

Haley was paid to do a job and clearly did not. My guess is because they knew we would not be extending our contract at the end of those four months when our sons moved in.

The size and location weren't bad for the price, and the one time pet fee made having a dog in college actually plausible. Unfortunately, that was pretty much all Hayley got right.\n\nThe yard was always a mess, with massive patches of dead grass and poor irrigation that caused the yard and our sidewalk to flood whenever it rained. There was also an issue where the owner of our property had requested that Hayley not sign anyone to a lease after our first lease ended so that he could sell the property, but Hayley signed us to a second lease anyway. This lead to confusion between us and the owner over whether we would be able to even live there the next year at a point in the year were most properties in town were already taken.\n\nHowever, the worst offense was their predatory security deposit handling. During our second lease, our new owners would visit often and always thanked us for taking such good care of the property. On moving out, we followed Hayley's checkout list in full and left the place better than we found it. Despite all this, instead of getting our security deposit back, we received a bill stating we owed $1600 in damages BEYOND what our security deposit covered.\n\nWe were surprised to hear this based on how we kept the property, so we requested proof of the damages we were being charged for from Hayley. We were told that we would have to schedule an appointment for that, but any subsequent attempts to schedule an appointment were ignored.\n\nFunnily enough, a friend in the same neighborhood who also rented from Hayley received a very similar bill upon moving out and has had the same experience in being ignored.\n\nIt seems as though Hayley's strategy is to scare young tenants out of their security deposits by asking for a ridiculous amount of money and then silently slinking off with an extra month's rent. To make things worse, this money isn't being used to clean or renovate the properties either, if the state of our property when we moved in is any indication.\n\nSo in summary, just avoid this company. Don't be fooled by the reviews here (if you look closely, almost all of the good reviews are years old with no comments and the recent reviews are much more scathing). You may not have problems right away, but they're bound to arise at some point.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

I first want to state HMC was very point blank and aggressive and I find them to be unreasonably rude, making use threats and unnecessary means of manipulation to obtain rent EVEN THOUGH I WAS READY AND WILLING TO MAKE A PAMENT. After a recent Identity theft and a severe life threatening illness that left me homebound for several months I was very hesitant to send large amount of money to a company that I had never heard of. All this happened over text message too at that, though they Implied that I(who have had a great rental history prior to my current very difficult landlord) \"Had just been ignoring them and they had been trying to make contact\". All their problems were my fault. They show absolutely no desire and put forward effort to make my rent payment easy to make, just threats. even after the check I wrote them was RETURNED TO ME DUE TO SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. Excuse my language but i didn't even know where the goddam office was. This is an inexpensive company that at the moment appears to care nothing at all about about the well being of their tenants. This is just a personal note, but I can give the impression of that of a low income person in trouble (when in reality that was not the case) and I get the impression that this company has been using the fear and threat of security as a means manipulate their \"less desirable\" clientele regularly for some time now. they seem very practiced. My advice, don't do business with people who use fear as a business model. I will be living my very well enjoyed home to work with a company that values my business and perhaps more importantly, value me as a human worthy of respect.

We had a roofing company ready to take care of what needed to be done after the adjuster went to your home.  Your father said he had a buddy who was a roofer who could handle the issue.  Your father's roofer is to blame for not removing the wet/molded insulation in the attic.  Your father's roofers did not put the gutters back on after the repair.  You asked us to handle.  Our contractor said the roofer did a sub-par job. You asked us to send everything to your father.  We did as you asked and he blamed us for what his roofers failed to do. You asked us to handle the interior repairs.  Our contractor handled the repairs from the ceiling down (patch and paint).  As we were not provided a copy of the adjuster's report, we had no way to know what was going on in the attic. We are certain you were paid for mold removal/remediation yet you never received a bill/estimate for mold removal/remediation from our contractors.

I have been renting with them for around 14 months now. If you qualify and meet their standards they are wonderful to work with. If you are paying your rent in full and on time, they will go above and beyond to meet your needs. However, if there is an unexpected life turn, even notifying them will not help. I was laid off at work and could no longer afford the rent. Even their qualifications say that you must make 3x the rent in a months time. I now make less than 2x the rent. I notified them of my life changes thinking that was right thing to do, but as I had forgotten, just remember they have a contract in place and that is what they will go by like any other business. They are still a great company despite my disagreements and misunderstandings on some of their business practices, but if are going into renting with them knowing there is even a possibility of financial changes in your life, I would not recommend them.\n\nAdding in response to owners reply. They did offer me release option, but ultimately that is continuing to pay the rent in full as usual until it is released, sold, or until end of your lease (which ever comes first). This is extremely risky option for someone who cannot afford the rent in the first place. Can\u2019t afford their rent, but they want you to pay two rents while waiting for them to find another person to lease. Great idea guys. Even when I offered to pay 3 months rent, plus them keeping deposit to end lease ( 6400 total).  They claim they can get it leased in a month or two (3200 total) so why not take the 6400 total and let me go? Hmmm, wonder if it\u2019s because they cannot/ or don\u2019t try to immediately lease it out??? Just a thought. You have to move out before they will begin to show, again paying two rents. Not a great option when I cannot afford their rent, so no that\u2019s not helpful as he claims. Not sure how that helps me at all as they are \u201chelping me out of a bad situation\u201d. And I have signed and returned the release option papers, so I am unaware of what that is about. I even got confirmation emails they were received, which I am happy to provide to anyone showing the dates of his post vs the dates of the emails. Also, I highly doubt I am the only person that has gotten frustrated from being in a financially binding situation, so not sure how that deems me the most difficult with this type situation. Again, great company, until you are in a financial situation where you cannot make rent.\n\nUpdate on this (today 7/30/19), as if the owner below saying I did not sign and return the forms in June wasn\u2019t enough, just got a call saying they did not have the forms (supposedly) and could not process anything. I told them I had email confirmation that all forms were received and would be glad to forward that over. Was told that worker was on maternity leave and they could not access email to get the forms. Not sure how that\u2019s my problem??? But sure, I\u2019ll redo everything again since you cannot properly arrange cover while employees are out on leave. \ud83d\ude04", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1561389386223, "text": "Cindy,\nThank you for clarifying the fact that we hold renters to the agreement that they signed.

We weren't sure - the door frame just splintered one day when opening, leaving the lock virtually useless. (The door was not in particularly good shape when we moved in.) We didn't file a police report as there was no evidence that a break in had actually occurred. When Rudulph repaired it and didn't charge us, we thought there was no issue, since nowhere in our lease did it indicate a police report would be necessary. We were a little shocked when we moved out several months later and over $400 was deducted from our deposit specifically for the repair of the door - without prior notification by the property manager of the cost of the repair, which only included a new deadbolt and a patch fix to the door and frame. Upon speaking with Mr. Rudulph, this was how they recouped their investment in the door repair.

We were hopeful that Ms. Jefferson would appreciate our efforts advocating for her even though she was legally responsible to pay this owner. We value integrity, and we honor our established guidelines, signed agreements, and thorough Move-Out process.  It\u2019s unfortunate when a former tenant doesn\u2019t take responsibility for minor items and subsequently tries to damage a business with an alias account on an unregulated review platform. The only way to combat such reckless libel is to give readers access to the facts.\n\nAs for the move-out charges, we provided Ms. Jefferson an itemized deposit record per our agreed upon lease agreement. Despite our right to charge $279.88 to Ms. Jefferson for minor damages and cleaning, we advocated to the owner on Ms. Jefferson\u2019s behalf to allow us to refund her $250 deposit. This property owner ONLY made an exception with this specific tenant\u2019s deposit because of her long term tenancy.\n\nCopy and paste this link to view the documents (https://goo.gl/7rV1Tf), which include the 4th page of the lease with the applicable areas highlighted, the move-out form with photos, the original deposit letter, and the final adjusted tenant ledger.  A review of this information shows we were justified under the lease to make these charges. It is a farce for Ms. Jefferson to think the threat of a frivolous lawsuit \u2013 and not our intervention \u2013 was the reason she obtained any refund at all.\n\nOur goal as a property management company is to have both satisfied owners and tenants, which sometimes puts us in a difficult position. We do not operate any facet of our business arbitrarily (for \"no reason at all\"); our reasons and policies are factual and transparent and are found in our lease agreement. We are saddened to hear that even after we advocated for Ms. Jefferson she still chose to leave such poor feedback. However, she stayed with us for over 3 years and renewed early each year \u2013 which is some testament to our good service, a point unmentioned in her review.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is very important to us, and we are disappointed we could not resolve this situation more amicably."}, "gmap_id": "0x888602ebf9152bd9:0x85412d49794a4d9"}

He referred us to a stress free contact for our mortgage and collaborated with all of us and the selling realtor to make sure everything was running smoothly. He was on time and helped us. He made sure that everything was done in a timely manner. Jake made sure all of the repairs were completed that we requested after the home inspection and continuously followed up to make sure that they were completed. All of the documents and contracts we had to sign were sent over and he dealt with pretty much immediately as well as explaining what it all meant.

The day I moved in I had a leak in the ceiling, I was told it was fixed and moved on. The people seemed nice and I loved the apartment. Fast forward a couple of months, I had another leak in the same spot. This time it damage the drywall. I was told there was no danger of mold, etc and that it had been fixed and cleaned. I took pictures this time. Fast forward another few months, another leak, this time bigger- all of these were from my upstairs neighbors air conditioning unit and/or water heater. Still did nothing  to fix the drywall and there have been water stains and cracks on my ceiling for months. Then last night the water heater broke again and it flooded my upstairs neighbors apartment as well as mine. There was at least a half inch to an inch of water in my bedroom, closet, and living room. It came from the ceiling, it poured from the fan, it came from the vents...it took maintenance 40 minutes to get there and then he walked in, shook his head and walked out. Keep in mind this was 900 at night and I had just worked and extremely long shift and had to work again in the morning. My bed was ruined, my mattress was ruined, my rugs are ruined, my Martin guitar could be ruined. I have renters insurance, and I have been a good tenant. I pay rent on time. I report issues so they can be fixed- but they were never fixed. I was trying to get in touch with Wescott, the property manager, all night. She never answered. She still hasn\u2019t  answered. I will say that TJ and Pam helped me the most, and TJ did try and find me a place to stay last night but I was able to sleep on my couch and opted to stay at home to keep an eye on things. Good thing I did because My apartment is still leaking and it\u2019s 900 AM. For all I know there could be mold in the area where it leaked before that they said they fixed. I know there probably will be now. I don\u2019t feel like this is a safe environment, and the fact that I cannot reach anyone who will help me when needed today is extremely frustrating.

I lived there for a year, and these are all the good and bad about renting from this company.\n\nThe good: All of the staff I dealt with there nice and professional, and were responsive anytime I had to talk to them. They also compensated me for the problems I incurred when I moved out, so that bumps them up from a 1 star to 2 stars. The property was in a pretty cool location with a nice view of the BHAM skyline. Aside from that, there's not much more to add.\n\nThe bad: Now the buildings in this complex are at least 80 years old and in rough shape. The specific unit I was in was a \"renovated\" unit that had a new kitchen, bathroom, and updated fixtures.\n\nBefore I signed the lease, I asked if the unit had new insulation and was assured that it did as well as a new HVAC system (Ill get to this later). There was also various places where water was leaking by a window, a couple places on the ceiling, and the back door. I marked this on my paperwork and was assured that it would be fixed ASAP. A crew came out and \"fixed\" (Their version of fixing water leaks is to spread some mud on the wet spot and paint it. Quality fix) two of the three spots, and left the large one by the back door where water was running down the wall. Due to their \"fix\" the water leaks inevitably came back next time a heavy rain came through. Sent in another work order and they threw some more mud on it, still ignoring the largest leak. At this point, I decided to drop the issue and ignore it since they obviously didn't think it was a large problem and ignored it too. A couple months later, the ceiling fell since the sheetrock had sagged so much, exposing the rotting and moldy wood holding the building together and allowing ants, centipedes, and other pests into the unit. Once this happened, they actually decided to fix it after I sent a firm email to the property manager about it.\n\nThe other large problem I had with the unit is the insane power bills I would get in the winter months. When they updated the unit, they didn't replace any windows or install any insulation (Like I was told when I moved in). This made the unit extremely cold in the winter, and dreadful to live in. I would set my heat to 65 degrees and my heat would run every 20 mins trying to increase the temperature. The heater would pop the breaker frequently because it was drawing so much power. This leads me to believe that the new HVAC unit they installed was wired incorrectly. After multiple techs come out to evaluate the problem, supposedly including an electrician and someone from Alabama Power, the problem was still there. My electricity bill would be between $250-$350 during winter months on a 1 bed apartment. They eventually started sending me credits for the power bills after I complained enough about it not being fixed which as a nice gesture. Fixing the problem properly the first time would have been nicer.\n\nSome other issues I encountered:\n- A colony of fleas moved in on the sidewalk next to my building, and eventually made their way into my unit. After contacting H2, the receptionist told me to call the extermination company myself. I don't have pets, and this was on the outside, common area part of the building. It's not my responsibility to maintain common areas of the complex, this was H2's problem. So instead of fighting this, I bought 4 cans of Raid and did the job myself.\n- My dishwasher was not connected to power when I moved in.\n- I had multiple issues with the faucets, door handles, and other finishings in the unit since H2 cheaped out on literally every finishing in the unit.\n\nI do not recommend H2 to anyone. The lack of care when it comes to maintaining their properties and their \"we will do that later\" attitude is extremely frustrating.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkt5t06KxewsCl_jK8hiAMAGazcFVq0pBwPbx1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjvhQkisp5GN8iihltKazqZqppaVJn1_vSWkYj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb096ce12bf:0x5db2624fb37cb12f"}

As I type this, there is a constant dripping of water coming from my ceiling into a bucket that I have to empty pretty soon.  I think it's reasonable that this group should be called H2O Real Estate because I've had nothing but leaks from the ceiling and walls.  First off, when we saw the unit, there were no signs of leaking or roaches because I believe the unit had to have been cleaned up and painted before we saw it.  The day we moved in we didn't get the correct keys for our front door or mailbox.  Upon entry, guess what? Roaches (and then we noticed leaks soon after too).  Upon closer inspection of the unit, there were gaps and holes everywhere in our unit allowing bugs to come and go.  Whenever it rained, there would be a waterfall in front of our front door because there was no awning.  Upon an even closer inspection of the building and our power bill, the public laundry in the basement was (and still is) wired to our power meter.  After talking with the property manager, we were able to reach an agreement and agreed to pay a reasonable amount for the power after the issue was discovered.  It still baffles me that no one knew or told us.  Shady imho.  Maintenance people responded fast to our requests.  The plumbers involved in the renovations throughout the building began cutting open pipes in my room without telling me they were.  Also, one of the leaks in my bedroom has persisted for over 4 months and still hasn't been fixed but I'm reassured that it has been fixed each time.  I'm convinced the walls of this place are filled with mold.   I'd recommend finding somewhere else to live as other people detailed similar experiences at other H2O units.

The problems never got better and Emily the property manager at Redmont Square really was no help whatsoever. Since moving in there had been one problem after another. Let me preface this with, we did a walk through the Thursday before and pointed out these issues. First, on the day of move in, upon arrival it was clear that the apartment was not ready to be moved into, yet you set a move in date that in involved us paying a proration(something I\u2019m fine with paying if the apartment is ready). Lights weren't installed. Light fixtures were full of dust and debris. My first problem I see is that the weather strip is missing to the front door allowing easy access for bugs into this apartment along with releasing air conditioning. Second I notice none of the electricity in the kitchen works and that the refrigerator is not even plugged in and the new appliance plastic hasn\u2019t been removed from any part of it. I was able to receive no help from any of the maintenance on this issue until Tuesday. Luckily my leasing agent Robin was able to contact someone higher up that was able to give us ideas that I would have to try to make them work(ideas involving me having to flip all the breakers) and one of the ideas did work. This should not have been my job to do this or have to set up the refrigerator. Next, I noticed that in the bathroom the paint was still missing on some of the drawers from where it had pulled off from opening. Under the sink in the bathroom. There was still exposed insulation and direct access into the wall along with missing paint on the inside of the underpart of the sink. One day, we started noticing the toilet not flushing properly(just filling up with water). Tried plunging that didn\u2019t work. Called emergency maintenance and had to insist they come that day. Where this gets worse is I try taking a shower and realize the water is starting to pool up so I turn it off and when I do. I notice something starts coming out of the drain and realize it is actual human fece and not tiny specs of it, little chunks. I called emergency maintenance again to demand they come out immediately. Let me remind I just moved in officially on Sunday before that happened. Maintenance did eventually come but was unable to remedy the situation. So plumbers had to be called and they finally remedied the situation. This total ordeal lasted from 12-8 on a Tuesday. I was told by a worker that this has happened at a few other apartments at this building and also told by one of the neighbors that this place is falling apart and that there is always an issue. This has been true so far. This problem continued to happen throughout the entire time I lived at the property. The dishwasher didn't work well(main attraction to this apartment before realizing that) and wasn't even hooked up when I moved in. The reason I\u2019m writing this review today is because after moving out I am leaving unhappy and believing this to be a pretty amateur company.. Seems a lot like the nightmarish stories I heard about Southside Apt Company. I find this to be unacceptable with all the problems and don\u2019t understand why we were allowed to move in before it was ready. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone and if you are considering it, be ready to have issues.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb096ce12bf:0x5db2624fb37cb12f"}

First of all, we listed our home during the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020.  Moreover, our home was in the higher price range for the Huntsville area (only 8 homes in the price range had sold in the previous year).  When we were interviewing potential real estate agents, many of the candidates told us we should expect it to take two to three years to sell our home.  Christine did not.  She told us she would market our home locally and nationally and that she would find us a buyer at a fair price.\n\nThe marketing was fabulous!  Great photos, aerial drone pictures, a video walkthrough as well as a high-tech simulated 3-D viewing system.  We were very impressed!  Nonetheless, we were worried because during the pandemic, lending on higher-priced homes became very tight.  Nonetheless, we received a number of offers quickly.  Unfortunately, the initial offers were too low.  Christine had done an appraisal on the home and encouraged us to wait as she said our listing price was very fair.  We took her advice and ended up with several interested buyers in an acceptable price range and we sold our home.\n\nThe closing went very smoothly because Christine and her team tied up quite a few loose ends to complete the transaction.  We had already moved out-of-state and relied on Christine and her team to coordinate the resolution of all the inspection items as well as the sale of our pool table and the shipping of a several furniture pieces we had left in the house to an antique store to be sold on consignment.  Talk about full service!  Everything was wrapped up within six months and we could not be happier!  Incidentally, we sold our home to an out-of-state buyer, so Christine's national reach really paid off.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1606935348232, "text": "Charlie \u2013 we are so appreciative of your kind words.

From improper electric outlet placement, bolting our kitchen island to the floor facing the wrong direction, installing the incorrect shower in our guest bathroom making us lose a window, installing the WRONG HARDWOODS throughout our home, installing the incorrect countertops in the home, having to have the painters come out 4 times to fix paint issues, having to pick a different carpet after signing off on our choice because a cheaper company won the bid, to getting a \u201cbad batch of brick\u201d that completely looked different than what we had requested, to having to re-seed our own lawn after they laid dead grass down, to having a \u201cdelivery truck\u201d leave a 4\u201d divot in our front yard that we repaired ourselves, to putting the wrong house number on our home, to installing the incorrect hardware on all our drawers. I could go on, but I feel that\u2019s a decent list to convince you to never contact this company. Everyone points fingers at others for why things are incorrect and nobody can give you a straight answer. We were told several times \u201cyou can\u2019t expect it to be perfect\u201d... but it\u2019s a new construction home, it should be pretty darn close. I can\u2019t imagine if we had been building this home while living out of town what we would\u2019ve been walking into for the final walkthrough. DEMAND A KEY!!!! You will need to go out 2-3 times a week to check and see what they messed up. They will never meet you on a weekend or on a Friday afternoon. So be prepared to take off work for all meetings.\n\nWe closed on our home November 16, 2020. Our original foreman (who we asked to replaced) \u201clost\u201d our shelves for the corner cabinet in our kitchen. Our new foreman said they would get to us ASAP but that we should go ahead and close. Well on February 8, 2021, I texted him inquiring about our shelves since we still didn\u2019t have them. He called me and told me he was having the painted the following day and would leave them on our porch that Friday. Well ONE MONTH LATER my husband sent another text to him saying \u201cOur shelves?...\u201d to which he called my husband stating \u201cSorry man, it\u2019s just been raining so they haven\u2019t been done\u201d. Raining for an entire month? Once again, assured they\u2019d be here in a week or so. Well here we are mid-April and we still don\u2019t have shelves despite weeks of beautiful sunshine. It\u2019s just really unfortunate we\u2019ve been waiting 5 months for shelves that were lost.\n\nSo I hope I\u2019ve shed some light on these terrible business people and their values as a company. I would recommend doing your research & not just go with the \u201chometown people\u201d, because they don\u2019t care.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9bae65f69b:0x596f6bff85d706ed"}

When we initially signed the lease for our apartment we were told that it would be cleaned because it had been vacant for several months. When we got the keys there were dead pests and eggs in our sinks, and even or fridge. They sent someone to clean again but they did not do a good job of cleaning so we had to clean it ourselves. We were not able to move in until about 2 weeks after our lease began because of issues with sanitation. Yet we still had to pay rent for the entire month and they did not seem very accepting of our concerns in the beginning. However, I do understand with this being a college town people do all seem to move around the same time. Also our dishwasher and garbage disposal were both broken and the microwave only worked when it felt like it (not a big issue). It took several weeks for us to get a new dishwasher. However, the service that did come was very friendly and seemed to genuinely desire to meet our needs. Our last 3 months in this condo we have gone without a kitchen light that they were supposed to send someone to fix but never did. All in all, as long as you pay rent on time, don\u2019t need much assistance and like your location, you will be fine. Once we got all of the kinks out in the beginning we loved our condo and our location.  If you desire a hands-on and caring management company this company will not meet your expectations.

First and most importantly, The HOA board or staff needs to work on professionalism and handling situations case by case. It clearly states in the covenants that fences will not be brought forward except in special circumstances. They would not even discuss my case, just redirected me back to the covenants like I hadn\u2019t already read them. Plus, most of the time, a fence is for privacy. I could care less about the right side of my home, but not being able to have my son\u2019s bedroom window inside the fence for security and privacy reasons is crazy to me.\nThe other thing I would greatly recommend is improving the design center/appointment. A design room where we can see EVERYTHING, and not the just basic options, would cut down on the confusion and disappointment after the home is finished. I was blindly choosing things I wouldn\u2019t have if I could\u2019ve seen what I was choosing before hand. A full design center with every option available visible to the buyer would help a lot.\nI love my home. There are major things I would do differently next time around, but overall, the quality of my home is excellent and my team was exceptional. I loved my community manager and project manager Ryan and Logan.

{"user_id": "117234347493630291856", "name": "Katelyn G", "time": 1602178484091, "rating": 2.0, "text": "Updating my final review of Davidson Homes despite their attempt to have me sign a disclosure that I will no longer say anything negative about their company since they fixed the issues. This paper also stated that since they are committed to excellent customer service that they would cover \"cosmetic\" items not normally covered. It should be very clearly stated that the items were not cosmetic and actually a manufacturing defect that never should have been approved by their supers. After nearly 10 months of owning the house, our 60 day warranty items are finally resolved.\u00a0Summary of issues that are now fixed --leaking chimney that caused severe damage upstairs and downstairs (took 7 months to be tarp free), water intrusion in the garage (claimed to not be considered a defect despite not being present in any other homes), cracked/misaligned window/door casings, manufacturer defect on marble vanity top that was supposed to be replaced before move in (attempted to not cover because it's \"cosmetic\").\n\nMy biggest frustration with them still reigns true despite the thorough completion by Chris Thompson--the amount of time and effort it took to get these things resolved is excessive and shouldn't have been necessary. The (majority of) representatives within Davidson have been friendly throughout the process including Ana Siersma, Chris Thompson, and Chad Vader. Although their production manager could use some people skills and learn to accept that in an instance such as this, the customer has every right to complain without being argued with; or without being met with rebuttals or attempted justification for all the issues or an attempt to silence their right to review. The good news for new homebuyers is that there are new managers in all departments and they will likely never need to personally interact with the production manager, but this unfortunately didn't make it any easier for all of the existing homeowners and I won't personally be able to speak on that. It may seem like I'm holding a grudge or I keep bringing up issues they fixed, and truthfully I should be allowed given the severe damage, unusability of our living spaces, and headache caused with the excessive timeline of repairs; but it's not just us with issues, I have yet to speak to a neighbor who has not had major frustrations with Davidson. So yes, I am happy that our issues are fixed, but there's no way to get rid of the bitter taste given the disaster that we were presented. However, according to a particular production manager and management who presented what can only be described as a non-disclosure since Davidson agreed to fix issues not ordinarily covered under warranty, the repairs are made so I should stop complaining. And yes, everyone has apologized profusely (some with \"buts\" attached to it) but that didn't change the outcome. And doesn't eliminate snarky comments such as \"this is why you have a home warranty\" or \"you wouldn't have been able to close on time if these were identified before\". Difference is, if we didn't close on time, it's not me, the customer, losing money having to pay a mortgage, it's Davidson.\n\nThe one thing that has been brought up multiple times (including our final meeting) that is one of my biggest annoyances is that we signed off on a preclose walkthrough stating there weren't the issues we're now pointing out. Our options on walkthrough were to accept that they're saying the work they did was satisfactory or not close on time. There was no in between, compromise, or room to question their work. It's not a good business practice to put homeowners in that situation and it's also worse that no one's really owned up to knowing/acknowledging that is an area of improvement and would rather argue the point. Maybe I have too high of standards coming from Florida where you don't have to choose the best of the worst which is what Huntsville/Madison is (not just me who has these sentiments, I promise). I hope that we can now enjoy owning this home because I really do l love our floorplan.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg74vRXko9572NJGY_DZ3QECcJ3DTnhspgfLXS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeCHolP-SAbHk1LBUMHn7H8GsRwRMwNNufF9S0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGzNTZwD9JdPQ1dF73EhYG30KnnYaXBDk7fkiC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMWgLVQ3r3XyuQO_rZLVijjjH-uXlswV8R0T-p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMedjz0c6vua5yUltOSUxvLGKRn7lZs0yw8ldmM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7N9tBJrbYYKMwNyHLPzw9Xhe3MmSVvpxfLnWW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg9dDOYNiJlIYfyTWDP5mCxqol2PyOtSz6CY4V=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0xT9ddYOcwZlXm-5KEdJeTjl790ErdKN-Igp1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyqfKx1ihP2LEt2zLvqDFs9aqRbG_YhdeWRpVA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1602184862246, "text": "Hi Katelyn,\n\nWe apologize that you feel your experience with us has been anything less than excellent.

We\u2019ve battled through this issue the entire summer and it continues today. I\u2019m tired of Davidson sending people over here who don\u2019t know anymore about the issue or resolving the issue than we do. We cannot and will not continue to have our AC down to 69\u2022 or lower to accommodate our room when it causes the rest of our downstairs to feel like an icebox.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure what was done incorrectly but we do know that something is obviously wrong and we\u2019re not sure why Davidson is not staying on top of the issue until it\u2019s resolved. We shouldn\u2019t have to keep contacting you all when you know that there\u2019s been no resolution.  Here it is at 0400 in the morning and I\u2019m awakened because of the uncomfortable, hot and muggy temperature in our bedroom as the remainder of the house is significantly cooler. The disparity is much more than just a few degrees difference from one room to the other.\n\nWe don\u2019t need anyone else to come here and to basically tell us that this is just how it is and this is normal because it\u2019s not! We\u2019ve withstood 100 plus degree weather for several months at a time in our house in Texas (temperatures were extreme) and never had this to happen. The temperature was significantly the same from one level of our house to the next; one room to the next. Similar square footage.\n\nDavidson\u2019s gotten away with putting terrible sod down in our yard and never watering or treating it but this will not be overlooked. We\u2019ve watched each and everyone of our neighbors yards get treated with the proper, upmost care for weeks at a time while we\u2019ve dealt with stony, brick laid horrible looking sod/grass. I\u2019m assuming since we didn\u2019t have a \u201cSean\u201d working on our property, we\u2019ve gotten the short end of the stick.\n\nIf we had to do it over again, we wouldn\u2019t. Starting with the initial person of contact for the build.\n\nLet us know what Davidson\u2019s plans are to rectify this situation.\n\nI must note that Ana has been the most positive experience that I\u2019ve had with Davidson thus far. I appreciate her customer service, communication, and willingness to help. I only wish that she\u2019d been the realtor (I do know that she\u2019s not a realtor) and that Sean had been the project manager when we started this venture.\n\nRegards,\nDZ\n\nThis is the email that I sent to Davidson Homes and no one has reached out to us to discuss or to resolve the issues.  Davidson has treated us more like an inconvenience than as customers. We should\u2019ve backed out of the deal when we initially started working with the realtor to build our plan but we went against our better judgement. Our options were not explained at all, nor were they laid out for us as they were for others in other Davidson builds. We were brushed off when we asked for details about upgrades or options. This has led us to make decisions based off of a lack of information and available options. The sod that they laid was ridiculous and they would not help us to get our grass up to part as they did for all of our neighbors. Unfortunately for us, we were the first to purchase and to move into our neighborhood and we\u2019re paying for it in the end. Davidson has put more care and concern in the neighboring homes and not putting any effort in meeting our needs today. Our master bedroom and bath stays very humid and hot and we have no explanation or understanding as to why it\u2019s that way. It feels like we\u2019re walking into the garage or the attic at times.\n\nWe\u2019re very disappointed in our new investment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602506039371, "text": "Hi Daphne,\n\nWe apologize that you feel your experience with us has been anything less than excellent.

This should have been brought up during the design meeting, but since it wasn't, I'm having to wire up my own connections. Not a big deal, just slightly annoying.\n\nThe bigger issue (more a problem with Heritage Mortgage) is if you're doing a VA loan, Davidson Homes / Heritage Mortgage will lie to you. They consider any VA non-allowable fees (borrower CAN'T pay) that the seller pays instead, to be a seller concession that counts toward their $3000 concession for using their services. So fees I'm not allowed to pay are somehow a \"concession\" to me. Total BS that cost me about $900. Good thing they had me fill out their survey prior to closing, because I left them a good review.

Was told a full sod back yard and the back yard has at least 4 large trees, 1 of which is a giant pine tree with limbs hanging over the house, one cluster of 12 small ones, and another cluster of 5 or so.  We asked them to let us cut the small ones and they cut the pine tree.  They told us no and we would have to wait until closing...WHEN THE BRAND NEW HOUSE IS UP!  We also explained to them that sod will not live under all of that shade, but they don\u2019t care because they aren\u2019t the ones going to live there!   Chantae lied and said the backyard would be bigger than the model home, well that might be, but a jungle was not what was represented!  She first said she didn\u2019t say that at all, then later said it was taken out of context.  They are all out to cover their own behinds.\n\nNow the windows are in, we noticed that the front window has grids.  We requested no grids at the design meeting.  We asked about it today, they said that the front window having grids is standard and there would have had to been an up charge to have no grids on that window.  This was NEVER mentioned before when we requested to have NO GRIDS.  Logan with Davidson Homes told us we can just go to Wilson Lumber when the house is closed on and buy a new  insert without grids and pop the glazing bead out to change it out ourselves. Once again taking no responsibility for it themselves.  Customer service isn\u2019t even in their vocabulary.

Out of all their models, I think it has the best and most affordable floor plan. I really enjoyed the experience of being able to choose all the colors and our new home consultant Chantae did an amazing job at providing her input and answering any questions we had. We also chose to use Davidson\u2019s provided realtor (which is free) and the realtor was super helpful (USE THEIR REALTOR). She updated us on the progress of the house and took videos and pictures. For the most part, everything was smooth and easy... almost too easy. The construction manager, Jerry, was very helpful and took his time to insure the house was closed and finished in a timely manner, all while insuring the tegrity and quality of the house was up to par.\n\nCONS: We visited the house several time to insure changes we made were being implemented. (Took the advice from another review and I\u2019m glad we did.) There were several key features and changes we had asked for that were being overlooked on the addendum. I think the root of the issue was due to our construction managers changing, however be mindful if you do have a lot of add-on and changes, try and check up on the house once a week or so.\n\nWHAT I WOULD CHANGE: There were things that I feel should be standard that weren\u2019t such as: numbers on the house other than just on the mailbox, a garbage disposal, gutters, and window screens (all can be added for extra cost).  There should be a choice as to what the \u201cplant package\u201d includes. The randomization is pretty... random and the plants were basically dead by move in time.\n\nIn all, the experience with Davidson was fun and exciting. You can tell that the people you work with along the way really care about their job and about you.

Because of Davidson Homes I will spend Christmas 2018 sleeping on someone's floor instead of in the new home I contracted to have built. Why? Because the contractor blames the city of Madison instead of admitting they tried to take shortcuts.  My original completion date was suppose to be in October. Then a closing date was set for Nov 12. A few days before closing I received a call telling me the backyard failed engineering inspection due to flooding. This was an issue that I had asked about before I purchased the property and asked about during the building process after visiting the site when it rained. I was told it was \"OK\" Then the home would not pass inspection. Davidson let the property sit for over a month with no work being done. I was told they would put a retention wall in November by Jake Blagburn.  After extending my monthly lease on my apartment 3 times I was forced to move out or pay more than double rent because I was month to month. I contacted the Sales manager Lou Paratore at Davidson and asked to help put me up in lodging. He flat out said \"NO\" you have to pay to live somewhere. Which is true. Yet Davidson Homes cannot give me a date as to when the home I gave them a down payment would be ready.!He then explains that work would began maybe the week before Christmas and maybe the home would be done sometime in January. I am offered no compensation only apologies. Yet for Christmas and New years I am sleeping on the floor on a air mattress while paying for storage. This company has not treated me fair and Lou Partore is very smart mouthed and disrespectful. All I have asked for is to move into the home I have a contract on and help with lodging. My only source of income is Social Security Disability and Veterans Disability and I cannot afford to pay for hotel when they cannot even give me a date that they will done.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886280bed8be8e63:0x676f1cf11b65cd20"}

My husband and I purchased our first home this month. We used Pam Files as our realtor and Cindy Morrison for the lending process. Both ladies are from this office. We had heard so many horror stories of how hard it is to get to the closing table and how much of a head ache it is. Hands down, Cindy blew that rumor out of the water. This super woman had us ready to close in less than a month! Cindy works really hard and really fast to get the job done. It was as easy as pie lol. And Pam, this woman is so sweet and lovely but, don't let that fool you. She can get tough if need be to get the job done. We had issues with our builders making MANY mistakes and dragging out the closing date. Pam wouldn't let up on them till they got the job done right! Pam was so caring during the hunt for our home and helped us through the entire process. She was there to answer our questions whenever we had them. She has a great eye for detail and noticed things I never would have noticed when looking at homes. She really took notice to what I like and what I was looking for in a home. She read my personality well. We finally found the home of our dreams (a french country spec home). We were not expecting to deal with problems from the building company but we did. As soon as problems started to arise I thought I would become extremely stressed out but Pam stepped in and handled everything. I am truly thankful for everything Pam and Cindy did for us. I can't wait to get our house settled and decorated so I can invite these two ladies to our home warming party. We would not be in such a lovely home had it not been for these two wonderful ladies holding our hands through the entire process. Thank you so much Pam and Cindy!!! You two are like family to us now. I will definitely recommend you guys to everyone I know who is looking to buy a house or refinance. <3", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889046c4e1ba371:0x9ec2a05ed9bbcf0"}

Overall I cant say a whole lot about the accommodations. When we booked the room, being as it is to sleep up to 6/7 people, we were told that two parking spots came along with the booking. When we got there to check in, we found out that we had to pay additional fees for any vehicles. Not a single one was included in the booking cost. Not even 24 hours in we had problems with the room keys not wanting to let us in. Some times it would blink red, sometimes it didnt register at all. We had to go to the office 4/5 times to fix the issue. Finally they replaced the batteries in the main lock. The office staff was rude, pissy, and didnt have much interested in helping their guest. Lastly, upon leaving, we did the courteous thing by sweeping majority of the tracked in sand up,  wiped down counters, made sure all dishes had been ran and washed, and so forth. Left, turned out keys in. And headed home. Today May 31st we are charged $110!! after speaking with someone at anchor, who didnt know why, she contacted the condo then gave us a call. These people are trying to say that they have pictures of ashes and cigarettes butts all over the room, and claiming they had to strip everything down due to the smell of smoke. Mind you we have small children in this room under the age of 5!!!!! Not once was a cigarette brought into that room and we are extremely disappointed with the way this is going. Might I add we were also charged another $40 for them to wash the comforter! The cleaning policy clearly says fresh linens are included and any additional cleaning will be extra. There was not reason to be charged extra! We will be doing everything in our power to have our bank reverse the charges as they are FAULTY!!!

Also, we were not excited to be dealing with the situation throughout our entire vacation.\n\nI mentioned that they moved us, but it was to a more expensive house, which they chose. We just asked to be moved. They attempted to force us to move, or pay the additional price. We said that was not what we were comfortable with and that we'd use our trip insurance or ask for a refund.

We requested several times and were told she would call us, but the employees would call us back.\n\nThey were borderline harassing us about this and ultimately, quit harassing us when they charged my card for an additional balance I did not authorize.

We have bought/renovated/sold several houses over the last decade and she by far provided the best expertise and customer service that we have ever experienced.\n\nWhen I messaged her, she called and chatted on the phone with me for a while about what we were looking for. I have had this kind of conversation with many real estate agents over the years and almost always, it takes a while for them to really get a feel for what we're looking for. There are usually lots of misses before we hit on something. But Debi dialled right into what we were looking for and what was important to us. The very first house she took us to ended up being the one we bought.\n\nAs we went through the houses together, she made excellent and insightful points about how the house could function for our family. She gave excellent advice without being at all pushy.\n\nShe somehow finagled getting us a second showing on the house the same day so we could make a final decision. And more than that, she put us in touch with a mortgage agent who gave us a prequalification letter for a physician's loan with great terms at 9PM on a Satuday so we could put an offer in. Not exactly standard banking hours. We would have definitely lost the house without that letter.\n\nHaving her help us navigate the negotiation process in this hot market was priceless. Her gut instinct was right on. By taking her advice, not only did we win out in a multiple offer situation, but we saved about $10,000 by structuring our offer the way she suggested and not allowing the sellers' agent to strongarm us into taking out our escalation clause. She was a fantastic guide and advocate.\n\nFor anyone moving to Birmingham, Debi needs to be your first call. From the time I first talked to her to the time we had an accepted offer on the perfect house in the perfect neighborhood (and our preferred area was SMALL) was just over 48 hours. IN THIS MARKET!!!! We really couldn't be more thrilled. We have been watching the market in this neighborhood for almost a year and are in disbelief at how smooth the process was.

It led me to an amazing realtor and Christian woman, Lisa Lynn who I now call a friend. Lisa helped me to realize the dream of home ownership with the building of my first home 20 years ago. The excellent service that she provided stayed with me. In late March of this year, I contacted Lisa and expressed an interest in selling my home. I was filled with so much uncertainty and the challenges appeared insurmountable. Lisa's years of experience become quite evident early in one's interaction with her. She knows every angle of real estate and shows an unbelievable concern for her client. The things that I worried about seemed simple, once I began to seek Lisa's guidance. She works with her client to address repairs and approaches each issue with extreme confidence, giving her client the assurance that she will be there to see the matter through, providing her expertise. Lisa knows the market well and even before the closing of the sale of my home, she had already found me a new home. Not just any home, but one that I had expressed an extreme desire to have. To say the least, I am overjoyed and extremely blessed.  We closed on both homes the same day. I could not have asked for or expected better service, devotion, or dedication.  Her level of respect and concern is simply amazing.  I am sold for life on Lisa Lynn. She is indeed my forever realtor and one who I call a friend. Should there ever be a next time, well you already know who I will call. Let Lisa help you sale and/ or allow her to guide you on your path to a beautiful new home. She is a class act.   The length of time for the sale of my prior home and purchase of my new home is nothing short of a miracle.  God had a hand in it, and I am not surprised that he used Lisa Lynn to help bring it about.  She can do the same thing for you.  I strongly advise your calling Lisa Lynn, my favorite agent and friend, for your sale and/or purchase of your new home.   I wish her Godspeed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562621367519, "text": "Thank you, Mary! We're so glad to hear of your fantastic experience with Lisa.

This guest booked on VRBO and they charge a \"booking fee\" when you use their site.  VRBO does not refund that fee.  We do not receive a portion of it, nor do we have control of that fee.

But to make a long story short we called to cancel today (today) 5/05/20 but was told by the \u201cmanager\u201d because it\u2019s not within the 30 days there will be no refund. Now you think a company like them would be understanding and willing to work with us but no. To top it all off they had the nerve to repost it on the dates we had rented it for and never even sent us a cancellation notice.

It was secluded and quiet, but just a walk away from downtown and all the fun that Auburn has to offer.

The renovations that Chris did are great, I love the flooring, paint colors, it had new carpeting and the room and closet sizes are great, it also comes with a (very small) dishwasher and a washer/dryer.

I went to Badger Properties because I read good reviews on Google and had heard generally good things from people. I went to the office in person and told Chris \"the badger\" my situation. I was just getting out of a 12 month rehab program, and had been working for a Christian Ministry and looking for an apartment in Auburn since I was a student at Auburn University at the time. I was very up front about my bad credit but was working 7 days a week and had many references etc to back up that I was honest and good for the rent every month. After seeing me alone in his office after hours, and asking me to come along (still alone) with him to see one of the properties (still after hours) I agreed because I was desperately in need of an apartment. He took me to an apartment to collect rent from a girl around my age, then he took me to another apartment where he basically showed me a place and then just sort of \"visited\" with some tenants. Every one seemed to like him, the apartments were pretty nice for how old they are, regardless, I was impressed at the time. We then went back to his office (once again, all happening after business hours) and he gave me an application, but before he did that he sat me down in the seating area of his office. We were completely alone and it was very dimly lit, and the front door was locked. He asked me extremely probing and personal questions about my past drug use. Mind you, I was sober for over a year at this point, active in church (still am) and admittedly hadn't even smoked a cigarette in over a year. He asked me questions like, \"So what led you to do drugs?\" \"what kind of drugs have you tried?\" \"how did you do your drugs? did you shoot up? snort them?\" He just kept asking SO many invasive and frankly, inappropriate questions; it was almost sadistic. I answered them as honestly as possible without divulging too much, because I really needed an apartment, I was impressed by the ones he had shown me and I thought that being as honest as I could would show him that I was a good tenant despite my bad credit, etc. After filling out an application and getting my credit checked through the program he said he uses to run credit (which gave a very vague summary of ones credit) I went back to his office once I had submitted my credit report and application. He said he didn't think he could rent to me because my credit report showed that I was $25k in debt; I explained that those were my student loans and that the program he uses wasn't showing exactly WHAT the debt was, just the amount. He said he couldn't rent to someone who was that far in debt. I explained that I am a student and that those are my student loans. I said, I would get a more in depth credit report and bring it to him. He gave me back my money order with the application fee on it and said to come back with a new credit report. My aunt is a real estate agent and she ran my credit for me, this time I had a complete credit report with every single student loan showing in detail, but because I had now ran my credit twice in one week, my already poor credit score was even lower. Despite that I went back to \"the badger\" and told him that the large amount of \"debt\" he saw was indeed my student loans, which were not even in collection because I was still attending Auburn at the time. He said then said he couldn't rent to someone with a credit score as low as mine and with a history like mine (due to my past drug use I had a criminal record. I have not had a single run in with the law in almost 4 years). So all in all, after wasting time, money, energy and being thoroughly humiliated, I would say that Badger Properties only serves those they deem worthy, and they don't believe in giving people second chances, only sadistically probing and dissecting the past of people who have made mistakes despite turning their lives around. A huge waste of time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459895750596, "text": "After 15 years of running Badger Homes and Badger Properties, I stand by my record of treating all applicants fairly in terms of their qualifications for an apartment.  They area 1) Credit score, from a tenant or direct relative, 2) Academic progress, and 3) good references from their previous landlord.  As stated above, our screening reports DO only show a credit score, they do not show a full report - meaning, we don't know the type of debt.  Our screening criteria is designed to approve or deny based on the SCORE, regardless of the type of debt.\n\nIf this dispute ever got serious, *I could produce a chain of emails which would explain and clearly show the reason for Denial*.  There was never any \"trade\" or \"back door\" approval process offered, and their never has been since I started the business.  We document every case of approval or denial, so we are ready to defend against accusations such as these.  That is not how we operate.  To have one negative review in 15 years should be evidence of how we do things.  Are we perfect?  No.  But we don't run the kind of business we are being accused of in the allegations above.\n\nOn the rehab comment: I can confidently say that we have rented to people coming from / still in rehab programs.  We have also rented to gay, straight, and many different religions and ethnic backgrounds, as well as singles, married couples, singles with kids, and families.  We have rented to people with low credit scores, also, but they must have a direct relative with a qualifying score be screened and sign as a Guarantor for their lease.  Our records are clear on that as well.  The \"second score\" that was brought to me to qualify was well below our minimum qualification.  We require a 650, the score presented was well below 600.\n\nAs stated above, there was not a qualifying score, and possibly not the required academic progress - but maybe\nshe met that qualification, I honestly do not recall.  We do not search any Applicant's criminal record, only our employees.\n\nAs stated above, I DID refund the Application Fee, and provide a true explanation of the reason for denial.  I do not remember asking questions about shooting or snorting drugs - I don't even know enough about drugs to know what that would mean anyway.  I have never even had a beer in my life, which everyone I've known for 41 years can verify.\n\nAfter hours, most (not all) of the lights are off in our storefront office, and the door is usually locked, but it is a full glass storefront on a busy street full of shoppers - so hardly a threatening or scary place.  I admit I probably asked questions that I didn't officially need to ask, true.  I am sorry if doing so had a worse impact than I expected.\n\nI do remember that the reviewer above and I did go to see an apartment and collect rent from a neighbor, but in most cases our rent is paid online, and has been for years.  I always thought that giving tours after hours and visiting with tenants after hours was a sign of good customer service, not something I would have to defend later.\n\nIf an independent auditor surveyed all of our current and previous tenants - male and female - over the last 15 years, they would come up with a conclusion that we are a little slow on maintenance, tough on noise, but that's about it.  If they surveyed everyone that has applied and that we have turned down over the last 15 years, they would find that there was a clear reason for each denial, and it was based on our written requirements of Credit Score, Academic Progress, and References.  That's it.  There is no evil, juicy story to report.\n\nAshley applied to rent from Badger in Sept 2014 for a Dec 14 opening..  I admit, I could have done better with the questions or the office lighting(?), but I have made no further attempt to contact her or to be in her life in any way beyond the Application period.  I am not sure why in April of 2016 she has decided to bring these accusations/allegations."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf31c31a91691:0x5164e38502b4d2b0"}

From the beginning, the women that work there were very short and snooty with us, especially a young girl that worked at the front at the desk with short brown hair. Her nose was so far in the air, I don't even know if she knew what earth looked like. I got the vibe of \"I'm better than you\". No one is better than anyone no matter how much money you make, or what you wear, or what you do for a living. We haven't really had that many issues except a few. First of all, we own a dog. A well trained amazing dog. When we saw the house at first, the carpet was terrible. There was a huge black stain on the carpet in the living room and it was coming up at the seams in some places. You could tell the carpet was cheap and old and quite frankly plain nasty. They (owners/tom west) refused to replace the carpet because we had a dog. Also, the kitchen tile was terrible and in some places of the house, you could tell needed to be replaced. Second, We called Tom West a couple months back about a bed bug infestation. When we moved in, we had noticed little bugs a few places, but in the lease agreement, it stated we were to take care of pest control, not realizing they were bed bugs. We did not have bed bugs at our apartment and had verification from the previous landlord. We never called until about a year later when we couldn't get rid of them and they refused to pay to get them removed after we had tried just about everything. Its laughable now because we are moving out and they are still going to have to pay to remove them. Also, in the moving out procedures, you have to pay to get the carpet cleaned. They want me to have that cheap, stained carpet to get professionally clean knowing they are probably going to remove it anyways. We brought our newborn into this home thinking this could be our home for a bit, and now we are moving out 7 months later because it's just what's best. Over all, I would say the company is ok, but pick them last if you have to.

I will never ever again deal with this scam company who rips people off and so rudely present themselves to their customers. I also will never recommend them. If you pay a security deposit with them and leave them with a decent home as when you moved in, don't expect your deposit back. They will find \"repairs\" to get you with.

For starters the customer service in the main office is by far the WORST I have ever dealt with. Everyone is short and snobby especially the females that work at the front desk. I was renting one of their properties for close to 5 years. I travel a lot with my job and that was the only reason I stayed there so long. When I moved in I immediately had issues with things that were suppose to be done but wasn't. Had issues with things breaking and not working properly. It took forever to get some one out to take care of the issues. Then I move out and I have to get the carpets cleaned and provide a receipt only to be told that the carpets weren't good enough and they would have to have the company they use to come out and clean it again and charge it to me. They will not do a walkthrough inspection with the tenant before moving out. Then as I expected, my $575 security deposit is taken for painting the townhouse, so called repairs and cleaning. I paid to have the place cleaned as well but they have no plans on returning your security deposit. They make up whatever they can with no explanation. Just a horrible company to work with and I would NEVER recommend to anyone..Avoid at all cost. I notice all the 1 star reviews with the one 5 star review...that had to be a mistake!!!

We were told upon moving in to do a walk through and make a list of things that were wrong. We did, and we took pictures and gave them a list of about 15 issues we noticed. We rented a property from them for a year and in that year they fixed one thing off our list. Upon moving out we followed all procedures listed in our rental agreement. Most of the things on our list upon moving in we were charged for when moving out!!!! On top of that they made things up along the way in order to keep our initial deposit of $1150.00. They said that the property had leaks, mold and that we didn\u2019t turn in the keys and garage door opener all of which was untrue. We did not receive ANY of our deposit back plus they tried to tell us we owed an additional $500 +! When we called to tell them to take it out of the deposit they kept they informed us that it was over and beyond that. Then they changed their story to say that when we didn\u2019t turn in our keys(which we did) that we forfeited our security deposit?! When we asked what the additional money was for we also got a different story every time we called....first it was for removal of items(we left hangers \ud83d\ude44) then it was for carpet cleaning....call me crazy but last time I checked neither of these cost 1600 dollars! They then sent us invoices that they had that they said we were being charged for cleaning fees???! Entire house was cleaned and left in better shape than when we moved in.

We reported this a problem on a Friday and by Wednesday the next week our saving grace came in!! Thankfully, another agency took concern in our unsafe pool gate door and sliding door and even was going to take the issues to the health department, because without them, the right people wouldn't have been notified AGAIN, and it wouldn't have been finally fixed!

We moved to the North Side of Montgomery near the Zoo and the home was in a horrible location. The previous renters was a drug dealer so we had odd people coming out home at all times of the night and day. There is a constant leak under our bathroom tile that keeps the bathroom floor wet and with a lingering sour smell. The big gaps and horrible patching and painting is ridiculous,which allows for bugs and for the heat or air to seep out. The fence was incomplete and needed to be redone. We started having issues with our bank Regions and we informed them of the situation on numerous occassions,then on February 6, 2018 Mitch contacted my husband Cyrus (the day before his birthday)and was just rude and nasty and short. Long story short, the bank froze our account without notifying us, so once we sent the rent payment in and it bounced, Mitch was very irate and belligerent towards my husband like we did it on purpose. We have a 3 year old and a 1 year who lives here also, so why would be malicosly cause hardship like that? Then they closed down our access to log into our online portal and everything. February 10, 2018 we received a notice saying that we had until February 14, 2018 (Valentine's Day) to make a $805 payment or we'd be evicted and our information would be sent over to whoever they stated on February 15, 2018 by close of business. I just feel that since we've always paid our rent on time that they should of at least gave us time to pay it or figure out what to do before jumping to such drastic resolutions.

I understand the rent isn't paid and we are working on it to the best of our ability, but for management or employees to treat people so low and talk so badly to them will not be tolerated. I wish I could rate them less than a 1. Do Not rent from them.

As many others have noted, Dean was quick to respond to our inquiries as well as accommodating of our unusual communication hours (nightshift). Did I mention we are an active duty military family purchasing from out of state?? He made it an easy process and was so helpful in giving us information we wouldn't have known not being local, like which areas were convenient to shopping and highly-rated schools for our kids. In fact, he found and sent us the listing that ultimately became our new home before it was on any of the popular real estate sites. I believe this gave us an edge in an extremely competitive market. Ask for his opinion! He isn't pushy, but is more than willing to share his recommendation if you ask, which was very appreciated on our end.

My now-husband used Brian to purchase our home in 2017, and then we used Brian again to sell the home when moving to another state in 2020. We were able to get our home under contract within 48 hours of listing, because Brian really hustled and took it to heart when we expressed our desire to sell the home as quickly as possible!\n\nAny time there was an issue or hiccup, Brian went out of his way to make sure that it was smoothed over and on track for a quick close date. Because it was 2020 and we all know Mother Nature wouldn\u2019t let anything go as planned in 2020, our home selling process ran into a few stressful obstacles that could have sent me into a tailspin if Brian had not been there to calm me down and talk me off the ledge. But thank God he knew exactly how to make a high-anxiety person feel confident that everything was going to be just fine (and it was!). There were also countless times when we were out of state and unable to physically complete certain tasks for the home, but Brian was always willing to go the extra mile to get things done for us during all phases of due diligence and closing. Seriously- Brian took care of everything!\n\nI\u2019m no walk in the park to deal with (I\u2019m a perfectionist, I ask a lot of questions, I\u2019m very particular on details, I can be sassy on the wrong day-lol), but Brian takes everything in stride with a great attitude and a can-do mentality. And the best part is: We were able to sell our home for more money than we initially expected (we got some great offers!), and Brian worked hard to negotiate a deal that was both advantageous to us and also attractive to the buyer. All in all, Brian made our home selling process a super QUICK one and an overall positive experience, and I respect his incredible, go-getter work ethic!

I was trying to rent my home while going through several major life events.  Needless to say, I was very overwhelmed.  A friend highly recommended her to me.  I had contacted a few property management companies prior to my first conversation with Carolyn.  To the outsider, another person\u2019s home is just a dwelling without an emotional connection. To me, my home was a blessing from God and a source of pride at being able to independently acquire it as a single woman.  During the telephone interview, I asked her what made her so special or set her apart from the other companies.  Among other things, she told me that as a small business, she was able to provide red carpet service.  I was sold! Over the years, she did NOT disappoint me.  She ensured my home had renters who cared for it and actually enjoyed residing there.  She professionally resolved the few disagreements between the renters and me.  She and her team ensured my home was SPOTLESS when the first renter vacated.  Due to her team\u2019s diligence and tenacity, new tenants were qualified and in place in about 15 days.   On the afternoon of 31 October 2017, Carolyn informed me that the tenants would like to not only purchase my home but also close before Christmas!  I was elated and skeptical at the same time because I knew they were first time home buyers.  I prayed about the situation.  God answered my prayer.  Carolyn agreed to represent both parties and went above and beyond to create a win-win situation for both parties.  We closed on 20 December 2017! That is a BIG deal for first time home buyers to get qualified, obtain a down payment, have inspection issues resolved, and have all paperwork correct to close in 50 days during a holiday period!  Carolyn Dietrich has been and continues to be a blessing and great source of information in recommending companies to perform work in my current home. Carolyn, THANK YOU for all you have done for me!

EXIT realty in Gulf Shores is a JOKE!!! My husband and I rented a home for 1 year from them and the entire process was a nightmare.  The day we arrived our house was a disaster,  even though they were expecting us. There were paint cans every where,outlet covers were missing AND there were containers of rat poison sitting around. Needless to say we had to get a hotel the first night...fast forward to plumbing and HVAC issues that took a week each to get fixed until we moved out, no one showed up to do a walk through with us and then, a month after moving out, we were told they were keeping our deposit of $950 because of a couple crayon marks on the wall and 2 new toilet seats that had come unhinged...the moral of my story is they have poor customer service, they're dishonest and not dependable.  You have to follow up numerous times to get an issue resolved.  Judy who works there is rude and unprofessional. I was charged  $950 for literally a couple crayon marks, we don't live in poor conditions, it was normal marks from living in our home.

Being a former Realtor myself in Tennessee, I'm aware of the responsibility an agent has to their client.  When we hired Mr. Stanton, we were pleased with his feedback and demeanor.  As time passed the feedback, both from his weekly calls stopping and the review emails from the property viewings, slowed down significantly, however we would still consider it satisfactory.  Throughout listing our property with Mr. Stanton, we provided him with all of the information he requested.  However, 36 hours from closing, we were told that we would have to pay our property pool assessment to the tune of $4700.  It was our understanding this would be assumed by the new buyers.  At first he said that he didn't want to go around and around if we told him or not (which we did upon hiring him), but he was aware of our other assessment, so the logic of knowing one but not the other makes no sense.  As I stated in an email to him, even if we pretend that we didn't pass along the information, he's presented himself as one of the most knowledgable and successful agents in the area with lot of experience at the Gulf Shores Plantation.  How would an expert agent who does business there all the time, not be aware to ask about an assessment that began a year and a half ago, which all units there had.  He then proceeded to tell us that he checked on it and the assessment was non-transferrable and could not be assumed by the buyer, which we double checked with our HOA and that was untrue.  We had to pay it because our agent didn't negotiate that on our behalf in the contract.  We gave him a grace period to do something to make it right and were basically told that it just was what it was.  Instead, Mr. Stanton tried to force the situation/closing like everything was common practice.  Had any effort been shown to correct this or any financial responsibility whatsoever been taken, we absolutely wouldn't have posted reviews on every website we could.  As we indicated to the company before closing, with this not happening, we felt like we needed to let our HOA, others rental services and the general public know our experience with Mr. Stanton and Exit Realty.\n\nOne of their brokers/owners stepped in to call us to see what could be done and apologized repeatedly, saying he believed it was an honest mistake and that it has changed how they will do things in the future.  He said on all future transactions, they will have a disclosure form for things like assessments.  First, I am shocked that's not already common practice as I know in Tennessee everything has a disclosure.  Second, I am glad that this error may have changed how Exit Realty does business, but it was at $4700 of my expense.  We hope this helps anyone who is looking to list or buy in the future and will assist you in assuring the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0546b1066981:0xc327fec7a2544bfa"}

He checked in on us he got us a house warming gift that his wonderful wife had made for us, it is spectacular and it means oh so so much to have someone that barely knew me to care so much about our family. He went above and beyond his job, he stopped what he was doing one after noon in the brink of 30 minutes he drove to the house and showed it to my mother in law because she wanted to see it and give opinions, he is absolutely wonderful and I\u2019d give him 100 stars.

I would use Carin for all of my real estate transactions.  She helped me and my family purchase a home in Hoover when we moved in 2014 and she was with us every step of the way when we sold it in 2019.\nAs a buyer's agent she provided expert guidance on the area and real estate market.  She also provided expert recommendations on making offers and negotiating with the seller.  She helped us secure a home in a relatively short timeline and manage a closing with difficult sellers.  We were even able to negotiate a new roof with the seller because of Carin's expertise and contacts within the area.\nAs a selling agent she was with us providing guidance on prepping the home well before we put it on the market.  She was able to guide us on improvements and repairs that would be needed in the home prior to placing the home for sale.  Additionally, through her and her agency we were able to secure fantastic photos of the home and expert advertising in MLS, typical real estate web sites and an enhanced social media campaign.  We were able to get the home under contract quickly and sold with absolutely no hiccups.\nCarin and her team are top notch and I would recommend them for any of your real estate needs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922b3afaac19b:0x89e537b96525ef7c"}

I had a positive experience and enjoyed living here. I\u2019ll go over the positives first, then the negatives. Maintenance issues are resolved quickly, the grounds are well-maintained, the office staff is very helpful (and plan some fun activities a few times a year, like Easter Egg hunt with gift cards as prizes), and the apartments are in good shape. Rent is reasonable and water/sewer is flat-rate (a huge bonus in Birmingham). I only saw maybe 2 roaches in my apartment the ENTIRE time I lived here. I loved the Amazon package hub and newly renovated gym. I barely ever heard my neighbors, so I\u2019m guessing the walls are thick. Plenty of parking. Easy move-out process, they were very accommodating when I asked if I could move out a little earlier than my lease end date. And I got my entire security deposit back, which I was very happy about.\n\nAs for the negatives\u2026They changed the pet policy halfway through our second lease term. This new pet policy says \u201cNo fish, reptiles, birds, rodents, or insects\u201d. Seems a little crazy to change a pet policy mid-way through the lease after agreeing to let tenants have \u201cexotic\u201d pets. Are we supposed to give up our pets? Secondly, I lived on the top floor and a tree fell on our building, damaging the roof pretty badly. No water was leaking in the apartment, but our patio roof was in rough shape. This happened a month before I moved, and as of my moving date, it has not been fixed. There is a fly problem in the apartments. They\u2019re very hard to get rid of and appear every summer. The power bill is really high. For our ~1000 sq ft apartment, the power bill was $200+ during summer months (and we kept the AC around 72-75). This may also be because we lived on the top floor, but I wonder if the apartments just aren\u2019t well insulated.\n\nOverall, I liked living at Royal Oaks. I would recommend it to people looking to live in this area. I only ended my lease because I wanted to live closer to family and friends, and they changed the pet policy. I chose to move instead of giving up my \u201cbanned\u201d pet.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889225474462f53:0xd215d26c400e45c7"}

I guess I'll have to paint the walls myself!\n\nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE to REALITY or ST. CLAIR HOMETOWN RENTALS.\n\nI have a year here... so, things can change. So can this review see y'all in July!\n\nAlso, I did not feel discriminated against... as, I have read other mention discrimination.

I am a former employee of Blackwell Nelson and these reviews are absolutely true. They are the worst Real Estate Company. They are operating without any respect for employees and tenants. And the Boss Roxanne is a Liar and Deciever. I spoke with one tenant who lives at Four Seasons and she stated she had been complaining about a branch overhanging.To make a long story short the branch fell on a resident's car Blackwell Nelson claimed it was an act of GOD. But it was negligence. If they had cut the branch it would not have fell onto the car. They are several other complaints as well. I was fired from this company. And when I asked why was I being fired Roxanne told me we should leave it at that. Katrina was there as well. I thought I had the right to know why I was being  fired. She Roxanne was very vague. I then filed for unemployment and found out the reason I was fired was because of going into a storage unit without permission. This is what the company told the unemployment office. They do investigations as to why or why not you should receive benefits .I spoke with one of the residents of the storage unit and they told me that I was fine, also there was a camera on the storage unit as well. I lost an item and was looking for it in the storage because often times we place tools and other items inside storage units. So when I found out this was the reason I was fired I grew suspicious and\nwas very frustrated. I'm going through the process as we speak dealing with this company And I have filed a complaint with the EEOC. These properties are poorly maintained and they  employ young people and mexicans who they get over on. They  have no respect for safety. And there are several violations at hand. I even expressed my concern to Roxanne about this.  I can recall several unsafe practices  at this job. All they do is patch work and find the cheapest way out. I was an employee there. And the only time they fix something is if it is a sever problem the employees have to stress it to them. I was working there from October of last year until June this year. I have pictures of these unsafe practices. Also I can recount several instances  as well like illegally building a fence at Red Top .I was there when the job started. They didnt even have a permit and They very well knew it too. There was another instance where we were supposed to clean gutters and their method was tying a rope around one person climb to the top while the other person is also tied on to the other side\nthe rope. Nothing was securing either individual. This was very dangerous and  the rooftops were very steep. But some employees went along with this process I refused.These people need to be held accountable for there actions and the tenants are right. There are several complaints. There was a guy complaining the day I got fired he was very upset. This is an cancerous organization. I may be labeled as an upset individual and that may be correct . But what I am is a fair individual and I as well as these employees and tenants were and are being treated unfairly.\n\nThes people are Slum Lords I expressed this to one of the employees that still works therer. He may have well been apart of my firing as well. Because the day I said this to him is the day I got fired.\n\nMyself and the two mexicans were the only minority there. Ever one else was White. I dont want to play the race card I'm just stating facts\n\nAll people share this this", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571342479796, "text": "Blackwell Nelson adheres to fair labor practices.

Katherine had spent more than six years...yes SIX YEARS...helping her find it. We would look for weeks and then stop. Then months later, we would start over. We searched every neighborhood in town. We considered new homes, old homes, and *everything* in between. Our search continued on and on with no progress. I always feared Katherine would grow weary of helping us, but she never did. She was so incredibly patient ...always her same sweet, polite, and caring self....never once showing anything but kindness towards my aunt. I cannot imagine anyone else having the patience to spend literally hundreds of hours over that many years trying to find just the right home. Finally, my aunt decided to build  and Katherine found a builder.\n\nWhen it became time to sell, we, of course, immediately turned to her for help. Fortunately, she was there.\n\nOver the past weeks as I have had to realize that it is time to let go, Katherine has helped me deal with the sadness and the emotion of bringing the house full circle. Again, but with me this time, she has been the epitome of patience and kindness...never rushing me to make decisions, hugging me through my tears of sadness and loss.

I was selling a house listed by Averbuch. I asked my realtor if I could move out after closing because I had a  purchase closing (after the closing on the house I was selling) on the same day. And, I didn\u2019t want my belongings to set in a truck somewhere between closings. He said no, absolutely not, I had to be all out by closing. So, the morning before an afternoon closing  I had the movers there carrying my furniture to their large van; they had moved most of it out of the house by about 11:00 am. My Averbuch realtor showed up to tell me that their was a discrepancy in the survey and I wouldn\u2019t be able to close on the house as scheduled.   That meant I couldn\u2019t close the house I had purchased and that most of my belongings were stacked in a moving van. The movers then unloaded the van and stacked it in my oversized two car garage. The discrepancy in the survey was because we had  purchased the property we were selling from a surveyor who had surveyed the property himself and, maybe intentionally, marked the survey lines incorrectly. He had made a road into the property that was partially owned by a neighbor and it showed up when surveyed by another surveyor. (Evidently, the steps needed to close were all researched at the last minute).  We had a meeting at the attorney\u2019s office that afternoon with everyone  who was involved in the closing. The new owner, that was purchasing the home we were attempting to sell, was there.  He was from Colorado and he said he had no problem with my not being out of the house immediately because they didn\u2019t intend to move in for another few weeks. The outcome that day was good; we had great neighbors; they came to the attorney\u2019s office and signed over a strip of land so the driveway was legal and before nightfall I was able to close on both houses. It all turned out okay, except I had to pay for two movings and, since the movers were not  available for several days, I had to live without most of my clothes or belongings those days. There are several lessons to be learned from this story and, I hope, I\u2019ve learned something. I\u2019ve bought and sold several houses since, but always consider this the worst selling experience I\u2019ve ever had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212ce51d16f1d:0x8bb4895e638fd84b"}

I was initially supposed to have my pre-construction meeting in January. Unfortunately, my family had an unexpected death the same week and had to reschedule. The next available appointment wasn\u2019t until February. After I had the pre-construction meeting with the construction manager, I received and signed the meeting notes that had the \u201cpricing\u201d based on the selections made. I received an email over a week later notifying me that because I had to reschedule the pre-construction meeting my construction date had to be pushed out and the price of the house increased by over $30,000! So now I am back at square one looking for my next home.  This just may be my blessing in disguise. If a company doesn\u2019t see you for more than a dollar, then maybe they don\u2019t deserve my money.  I\u2019m truly shocked and disappointed by the lack of empathy shown given the situation. I\u2019ll never recommend anyone to this builder just based on this experience alone. I\u2019ve heard of nightmare stories, but I never imagined this would really happen. I get that companies are in the business to make a profit, but I do not believe that in less than a month the price we agreed to per our signed contract should have increased by over $30,000. I understand that there is an influx in this market however you don\u2019t tell me a week after sending me documents to sign (which I did) that my contract is null and void due to market demands. It\u2019s really devastating that a company that has built its reputation on people and prides itself on the best interest of the customer would do just the opposite. They violated our trust and have shown that they have no integrity. What was meant to be an unforgettable positive experience of homeownership is now a reality of uncertainty and anxiety simply because we believed this \u201creputable\u201d company would stand by its word.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1614726715672, "text": "We regret we had to do this as well.  We put the price escalation clause in your agreement to protect both Murphy Homes and our customers.  Current market conditions are causing incredibly difficult labor and material shortages.  Our cost inflation is so aggressive that we simply cannot build a home we are proud of without agreeing to nearly weekly increases in material and labor.  The revised price we offered was well below our current sales price.  For what it is worth, It was also below our breakeven price.

It was nice having a decent number of choices and Charlie/Cindy helped a bunch answering questions and suggestions.\n\nAs a whole, we still love our house and the neighborhood. It's a great location, nice neighbors, quiet, and will be a great place to raise our family.\n\nOn the house itself, during and after build, quite a bit of poor quality work kept being attempted to be passed off as normal.\n\nLimited quality control appeared to be performed. There were obvious issues that they just ignored; mostly cosmetic but some big ones too with outlets (see below).\n\nIt was known this was our first home purchase and I really feel they tried to take advantage of that. Instead of doing things right, they appeared to cut some corners and I guess hope we wouldn't notice or know any better.\n\nIt is disappointing when, based on reviews, it seemed like it'd be a stress free and streamlined process from a local company.\n\nSome of the good stuff:\n- Working with Cindy on selections was great. She really helped get things in order. Same with the Richards lighting folks who were great as well.\n\n- We really like the flooring (Cindy really helped out with us picking them!). Wolde did a good job making it look good.\n\n- Overall we love the kitchen. They did an extended counter/cabinets and moved pantry shelves to the large side closet instead. Got plenty of counter space with lots of storage - exactly what we wanted.\n\nExample of issues:\n\n- Improper outlet installations. Backstab connections on most, box recessed too far and mounted incorrectly (exposed drywall screws through box into stud), and drywall screws to attach outlet to boxes.\n\n- Bad outlet cutouts. Large chunks of drywall missing and tried to hide it with plate covers. Some of the holes were even outside the plates.\n\n- Ceiling drywall seams are very noticeable with bumps, tape edge, etc visible. For open plan and this lighting, a higher level drywall finish was needed.\n\n- Venthood was originally installed with no seal to the attic, just left open. They did come and spray foam up in it to seal it but should have been addressed by MH checks.\n\n- Stove is different model than what we ordered. Nobody called to let us know original not available anymore - it was a slide in, this one is free standing. Had I known I would have changed to a cooktop (prefer stoves with overhanging tops which this one is not).\n\nEdit:\nDropping to 1 star due to behavior of sub-contractors. Electrician walked in arguing, wouldn't listen to any concerns, everything was fine even if another electrician said it wasn't - and I have their report.\n\nIf you feel someone is wrong, discuss it and show why.

Numerous other night security lights were out as well----if you call for repairs, there is always an excuse.  I personally placed several calls for repairs, but they never happened.  The staff is generally a bunch of rude women who I truly believe get a kick out of talking down to the very folks that account for their paychecks.\n\nOnce she was finally able to move out, the unit was cleaned thoroughly--verified by parents.  It was cleaner than move-in.  Despite this, we got back only $140 of a $600 deposit--they claim the entire unit had to be cleaned, which is completely false and the fact of the matter is that it had to be cleaned before she moved in at the start of the lease.

If you are considering living any place managed by Duckworth-Morris, PLEASE THINK TWICE.  I will lay out a detailed review (with photos) regarding the significant issues at River Road Terrace and the management by Duckworth-Morris.\n\nFirst, the rotting wood frame and mold issue.  When I first moved in to River Road Terrace, I discovered a significant and ongoing leak that had created a large mold issue in the exterior utility closet where the AC air intake is located.  Mind you...this is where the air is ingested by the unit and then blown throughout the unit.  This leak had been neglected for quite some time given the extensive mold growth throughout the closet.  Management at Duckworth-Morris was slow at getting it fixed and it took several days to find the leak...turns out all of the units have these exterior vents and mine was the source of the leak (who knows, they may be all leaking).  During the extensive process of fixing it, the drywall was removed and the wood frame of the building was visible.  It was in some of the most deplorable condition I have ever seen.  The wooden frame was literally ROTTING and disintegrating.  I reported this to management who seemingly didn't care.  So, think about that if you are considering River Road Terrace or any property by Duckworth-Morris.\n\nSecond, the management at Duckworth-Morris regularly emboldens a particular resident (I'm not sure, could be more than one) who takes it upon themselves to be building code enforcement.  This particular resident on multiple occasions has left hand written infraction letters at my door, brandishing the draconian HOA rules.  Management takes this person at their word (likely because they are as relentless and insufferable toward them as well) in an attempt to appease the undeviating anger of the River Road Terrace code enforcer.  When I tell you...this person is relentless, its like a gnat that continues coming back just when you think its gone.  By the way, I have yet to hear a response from management as to what particular rule I was breaking in the HOA or anything that violated the terms of lease.  So, again, think twice if you are considering River Road Terrace or any property managed by Duckworth-Morris.\n\nI lamented my decision to live here.  Had I known of the issues I had dealt with since day one, I would have avoided this place like the plague.  I have lived in many apartments, and Duckworth-Morris is by far the sorriest excuse of a real estate and property management company I have ever seen.  It isn't until this horrid experience living at River Road Terrace that I have felt compelled to ever write a review.  I just want to make sure prospective customers know what they may be getting into.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsSCMzH1LPurBaLTV3NGFjVTrgFCPuaAXjnIdE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg3f5B-T7htG5NB6h4wevxMRFC1zE3pM0tqfCz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzFSd0yKYDEbsmiyQpli1AvJYym1h0MunPMPYt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPW6sJrpBvH70gA89KYwTWrxpDJgFdx9KzmBTc9=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8KY3zU5-no-UxczX-2NfSL4CZYALmWPIQ7GsN=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfil6tTboITB_4iKnWJG80Jf-P2UyY2qOm1vHK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602f1e028025d:0x110efdacdaeb7e3e"}

I have lived at Essex Square for 3 years the first 2 years I had a great experience. I have also always paid rent on time and never had any major issues. However, this last year with new management  has been horrible. The office sends out letters I feel are controversial and disrespect (letters posted) to their tenants.  I've also gotten letters charging me for a late charge from 3 months prior, to resolve the issue I had to take off work to provide them with a copy of the check that proves I paid my rent on time.

I am sorry that your car was damaged because you drove under the entry gate when it was on the way down after the car in front of you entered the property but it was not management's fault.

For the few months i lived there i had numerous strangers coming over knocking on the door trying to purchase crack cocain at all times of the night  I informed them of this problem and they did nothing to solve the problem.  I had to break the lease because of their crack problem they had at that location.  25 years later these idiots are still attempting to collect the lease money even though i told them id be leaving in 30 days and allowed them to put up a rent sign.  They are terrible!  I already won my case against them once.now after 25 years are attempting to collect again.  Seriously, this time im going to take evasive action against them.  1.  They knew before moving me in that their apt that it was a former crack house.  2.  They were aware that the montgomery garbage disposal trucks lined up outside my window on the street at 4 a.m 5\ndays a week not allowing me and my family to sleep.  They are garbage and i would never allow them to rent to you or anyone you wanted to remain friends with.  THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY THE WORST.\nTheir service sucked, their apt was worst and dont take responsible for problems that occur on their property. But yet dispite their terrible service and crack properties they placed me in.  Now that their is social media im going to enlighten as many people as possible warning them not to deal with these shady, money hungry , slum lords.\n.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x14fb1e3c2a23d17d:0xe9c38cd8f034d2e3"}

To be fair, the maintenance guy did come out and fix the leak promptly, but didn\u2019t do anything about the soaked wall.

This leak was in a place that had already had 2 leaks prior, which had been \u201cfixed\u201d.\n\nWhen the last leak had been fixed, we started to notice a smell. Not a good one.

For starters, the owner would randomly show up on our property without any notice. The lease clearly stated that the owner was to give us at least 3 days notice before coming onto the property, but she never did. There was another instance where she had some random guy come to work on our fence at 7am, no notice at all. We woke up immediately panicked by a stranger on the property. He didn\u2019t knock, and didn\u2019t tell us why he was there until my fianc\u00e9 went out to ask him. Even the exterminator guy was like, \u201coh she didn\u2019t tell y\u2019all I was coming? Ha she\u2019s funny like that.\u201d I have severe ptsd and didn\u2019t find it as funny to have strangers show up to my house with no warning. Lastly, we moved out on March 26th, when both the owner and the lessor told us we did a fantastic job caring for and cleaning up the house. They said that we would get back our security deposit by mail. I just received our deposit back and it is $170 less than it should be, along with a fat cleaning invoice. I\u2019ve cleaned houses on the market for a living before, and I spent DAYS detailing every inch of that house for our deposit. After paying rent consistently throughout the pandemic, while both of our jobs were shut down, I did everything I possibly could to get our deposit back. That house was spotless. Whatever dirt y\u2019all track in after we leave is your fault. It took them almost 2 months to mail us our deposit, only after we called them multiple times about it. During one call I heard her say, \u201coh sorry! We have the check it\u2019s just been sitting on our boss\u2019s desk.\u201d After paying consistent rent on time throughout the pandemic, even when the law protected us from not doing so, then being shorted like this, we are so disappointed and will not be recommending this company to anyone anymore.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286829fd26653:0x7530f712f641eefc"}

No malice intended.\n\nI rented a property from this company from 9/15 to 2/18. I met the owner of Southern Oak, Blake, at the property two weeks prior to move in. There were several small maintenance issues he assured me would be fixed before I moved in:\n\n- No exterior lights working (bulbs)\n- Carpet had very noticeable stains and cigarette burns in multiple places.\n- Carpet had ripples in multiple rooms, needed to be stretched.\n- 6\"x12\" hole in master bedroom closet drywall where they had repaired a damaged water spigot but did not repair the drywall\n- Return air grill was damaged and would not latch.\n- Refrigerator door shelves were broken and taped together.\n\nThey replaced the return air grill, and stretched the carpet, that was it. The guys that stretched the STAINED/BURNED carpet did not even vaccuum afterwards, carpet fibers everywhere. I needed to move in ASAP so I overlooked being too lazy to replace a few light bulbs, repair a drywall hole, and covered the cigarette burns in the carpet with furniture.\n\nFrom this point on this company was reasonable. My problem with them was at move out. There was no move in/move out documentation done. The move out inspection consisted of meeting Blake at the property where he walked around for 5 minutes. It took weeks to get my deposit back. When I finally did get a check back for my deposit it was $170 short. No letter explaining why, no phone call explaining why, nothing. After multiple phone calls to their office looking for an explanation they told me the carpet was not \"professionally cleaned\". That's right, the same STAINED/BURNED carpet that should have been replaced before I moved in was not clean enough for them. They had no clue what the move in condition was because they did not document it.\n\nWhile I lived at this property I repaired several small maintenance problems and did not request to be compensated:\n\n- Rebuilt two toilets\n- Replaced two sets of bi Fold closet doors\n- replaced two shower heads\n- installed two shower curtain rods\n- changed the ballast in the kitchen fluorescent light and replaced both bulbs with LEDS\n- Removed an entertainment center that was left in the attic from the prior tenant because I knew if I didn't they'd charge me for it!\n- Installed a coupling at the dryer vent because at move in it was 3\" PVC!\n\nEven with doing all this, and having the house much cleaner at move out than move in, they still withheld $170 from my deposit, and for that reason, I would not recommend them to anyone. They earned their 1 star review.\n\n***If you rent from this company, heavily document the move in condition of the property, or you'll be paying for it later.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286829fd26653:0x7530f712f641eefc"}

The staff are overworked and communication is terrible. They only communicate when something needs fixed. We finally decided to part ways 3 months after our last tenant moved out. Aronov received two electric and water bills during this time and never paid them with the funds we had in our account. We were charged late fees with AL Power (small but still) and Aronov had no answer for why they had not paid the outstanding bills. They also claimed to not know about a landlord agreement you can sign with AL Power that would have saved $40 connection fee every time the Power was put back in our name. The last tenant we had received free yard cutting for the first year because our property manager forgot to tell them landscaping was not included in the rent. When I noticed that we were paying for it, Aronov had the nerve to ask us to split the cost with them (Aronov) for the first year and then it would be the tenants responsibility. My last major complaint is the only marketing our home received was being advertised on the Aronov website. No Trulia, no Zillow, nothing. It\u2019s no wonder our home did not rent again. Actually my last complaint is they still cut checks! Get with the 21st century and do direct deposit!

The first time I used Jill I was in the buyer position. She was always quick to respond, showed me everything that met my needs and was always on time and communicated with me very well. She was able to secure me the first showing in a competitive market and helped me structure a offer that landed me my new home amongst many other offers. Then due to fortunate circumstances (married my sweetheart) I was needing to sell my house less than a year later. Jill helped me get the house staged and advised me perfectly on how to get top dollar for my home. Jill worked harder than any agent I have seen she even enlisted her husband to help. In the first weekend she had gotten over 60 showings lined up! I had 20 offers and walked away with $19k over ask!\n\nI cannot say enough about Jill. I think she is a constant professional who has her finger on the pulse of the market and will never steer you wrong. She has the patients of Job showing you homes and answering your questions. She is creative and understanding when helping you structure deals or choose between offers. Jill will shoot straight with you and help keep you centered when your  emotions (inevitably) get involved.\n\nMy wife and I are currently as I am writing this review are using Jill to find a home for our new blended family. The funny thing is Jill has worked with my wife before and was fantastic with her as well.\n\nThere is no better agent than Jill.

I called back 3 times with additional questions before we booked and he was still very professional.   When we arrived at the 3:00 p.m. check in, our condo was not yet ready.  We were not given a time frame, just said that we would get a text when it was ready.  An hour later we received the text that the condo was ready.  I was aggravated at first then realized how long it would take to clean that condo once we got in.  I would suggest moving check in to 4:00 p.m.  I did really like that we only needed a code to get in and checked in directly at the condo. We stayed at Blue Water (1504).  It had an amazing view.  Everything we needed to cook.  The kitchen was fully stocked.  All of the beds were comfortable and the condo was clean.  Convenient shopping and grocery very close by.  The only 2 issues were the toilet in the master bath was loose.  Was afraid we were going to fall off.   There was a really dirty chair in living room.  No one sat in it.

We always want to make sure we are doing our best to take care of each guest that books with Liquid Life. We are aware of the reservation you are speaking of although you are not listed as the primary renter. On the day before this reservation was due to arrive for check-in, our office received a phone call that the guests would not be arriving and would like to move their dates or cancel the reservation. Even though the guest did not purchase travel insurance (which is what helps protect guests financially in situations such as this,) we did offer to move dates for the reservation anyway. Unfortunately, the original condo booked was not open for the new dates, and you (or your primary renter) were offered another condo at the same complex. The future dates were in the peak season of July, which resulted in a higher nightly cost for the stay. The reservations team explained they could move dates, but the guest would be responsible for the difference in price. This was a special offer made to the guest, given the circumstances. The guest did not want to pay the difference, so the reservations team said they could cancel the reservation and try to re-book the condo. If the condo re-booked, Liquid Life would refund the guest for the rent. This was the only other option since travel insurance was not purchased and the guest did not want to pay the price difference. The condo did not rebook with such short notice, but Liquid Life refunded all fees but the rent in order to give back as much as we could to the guest. We understand that once the condo didn\u2019t re-book, and that\u2019s disappointing. Our customer service manager went back and listened to the original calls to make sure all the options were explained very clearly to the guest. We were, in no way, trying to keep money from the guest. Our team was trying to offer any options we could to the guest given the circumstances. We hope that you understand the situation more clearly now. We would have loved to welcome you to the beach and tried our best to do so.

Not to worry though, as they will fully refund our deposit.  Was told by Anita Fleming, Customer Service Manager at Liquid Life that the property was listed and sold in 1 day.  On 2/26 Realtor.com shows that property as having been listed for 36 days.  Would have been nice to be notified 30 or so days ago that the property was listed.

This was not the problem with our rental though.  I guess that is supposed to make we feel better about their advanced notice.  Thought these folks being local would be better.  Going through Brett/Robinson now.  Stay away from this group....there is a reason their prices are low!!!.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f95e0f40cd:0x357d2c5a26b9a07b"}

We only got to stay for 3 days and 4 nights.  I have 2 reviews for the condo experience.\n\nFirst for the condo owners...The condo was beautiful. Very tastefully decorated.  9/10. The only reason that I didn\u2019t give it a 10/10 is because I am personally not a fan of rain style shower heads and both showers had them.  I am a woman with thick hair and it is impossible to get conditioner completely rinsed out of thick hair with a rain style shower head.  Also, there were 2 Tupperware containers but no lids.  Would have loved to been able to save some left over food for lunch the next day, but hard to do without lids. Otherwise the place itself was perfect! Plenty of dishware  and glassware. King sized comfortable beds in both bedrooms and no carpeting anywhere.  The view is what we came for and it did not disappoint! Love the couch on the balcony!\n\nThe next review is for the rental company, Liquid Life.  I would give a 7/10  Most things were easy and handled well.  My reasons for not giving a 10/10 are the following: Not receiving the door code until check in time was a little bit nerve-wrecking. I am a planner, so not having check in details until we arrived made me a little bit nervous. Also, one roll of 1 ply toilet paper per bathroom for 2 women for 4 nights is not enough. We drink coffee in The morning, water all day, and wine in the evening. We pee. And one ply TP doesn\u2019t work very well so you have to use more, then it runs out quick. Also, there was absolutely no hand soap anywhere in the condo. We are at the end of a pandemic and there is no way to wash our hands without going to buy soap. They give you make-up remover wipes and lotion, but no soap.  When paying this much for 3 days/4 nights, I don\u2019t want to have to also go buy TP and soap, Or call the rental company and wait for someone to bring some. Just don\u2019t want to be bothered to have to call someone and ask for TP and soap. The last reason is for cleanliness.  It was pretty good. The linens were clean, no sand in the sheets, the kitchen and bathrooms were clean, no problems there, but I believe the floors (all tile and vinyl, no carpet) must have just been swept or maybe vacuumed, but not mopped or wet swiffered, because after we arrived the first night, we got settled, I took off my shoes and walked around the condo barefoot until I went to bed. I noticed my feet were filthy dirty when getting ready for bed. I had not been outside barefoot at all, just walking around inside the condo for a few hours. The balcony had something that had been spilled on it, maybe coffee? That had been missed by the cleaning crew.\n\nAll in all, I would give it an 8/10.  We loved the location because there weren\u2019t any other condos on either side right next to it, so the beach was less crowded.  There was construction going on right next to it, so that could change if they are putting up another building there. Also, I slept in the room closest to the road and hear a lot of loud sirens each night. The young man renting chairs and umbrellas on the beach was super personable and accommodating.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621264863164, "text": "Thank you for your review, Cory!

I made the reservations by phone to ensure the unit had never had pets and was told the whole building was pet free. When we arrived at the unit, we were greeted by a portrait of dogs and a condo covered in dog hair. Two of our family members had allergic reactions shortly after our arrival. I vacuumed up large bags of pet hair myself. The patio furniture was all inside, the front door stop was broken, and one of the tubs didn\u2019t drain. These were all small nuisances compared to the allergic reactions we were dealing with. I contacted Liquid Life. They would not move us to a comparable unit! We were told they would refund the cleaning fee & one nights rent if we signed a form stating we would not report this to the Better Business Bureau or comment any negativity about them on social media. I could not sign the form! It would be unethical not to warn other allergy suffers of the allergy concerns. Randy, the owner of the Liquid Life company sent me the rudest email I have ever received in my life! I did a Google search and found out Liquid Life had made the news and had a class action lawsuit against them. My family was lied to! My family\u2019s health was put in jeopardy because of Liquid Lies! My money was waisted because my son and sister-in-law could not remain in the condo with the pet hair! Liquid Life is still falsely advertising Phoenix West II unit 2309 as a pet free unit! I regret renting from this unethical company!\n\nI only left one review! I have no clue how it would be possible to leave more than one. I did fill out the survey that Liquid Life sent me, maybe that is what you are referring to. The numerous negative reviews on Google and the Better Business Bureau speak volumes about this company!

This is, in fact, a pet-free unit. However, the owners of the unit brought their pets prior to your stay without our knowledge. We do not control what the actual owners of these properties do on their own time. With that being said, you say that you booked over the phone to ensure it was a pet-free unit. We show in our system that you booked via a hot deal on our website, and it is coded differently than phone bookings. We also do not have any notes under your reservation regarding a call prior to your stay regarding any guests with allergies. We try our very best to accomodate all guests in the best way possible when it comes to these sorts of things, especially if we are informed ahead of time. During your stay, we sent our cleaning team out to you the day after you arrived as you denied them to come on your first evening. We could not move you to another unit at Phoenix West II as we were booked at that time. We did, however, offer to move you to another complex and you refused. You said that you wanted a full refund for your stay as well as a free stay in another unit. We tried to rectify this situation in the best way possible, and you continued to deny our offer. The only reason you received an unpleasant email from our owner is because you sent every staff member in our company a very demanding and hateful email after being given multiple solutions to your issue and you denying them.

After Hurricane Sandy caused all the destruction in Gulf Shores/O.B., we thought there may have been a chance that our vacation would be cancelled.  We understood.

I called back a few days later to see if there was a possibility of booking an additional 2 days.

The hurricane shutters were handy in blocking the evening sun from blinding you while sitting on the balcony.  The bedrooms are perfect sizes and the beds are comfy.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the doors or what but water bottles in the freezer won\u2019t freeze, but they do get very cold. We had no issues with the washer and dryer. Everything dried on the first cycle, maybe settings were an issue in the previous review?

The balcony is large with a view of the resort entrance and of the beach. We enjoyed drinking our coffee and eating our breakfast on the balcony each morning. The washer and dryer really came in handy for towels and swimwear and the icemaker was super convenient for making big pitchers of ice water. We had a couple of concerns of which I called Liquid Life about, and they were quick to resolve these issues. Of major concern was that the A/C was not working at all when we arrived, but Liquid Life got maintenance to the condo within a couple of hours and that problem was resolved.\n\nThe not so Good: The cleaning staff needs careful monitoring. For the most part, the condo was clean, but there were a couple of glaring issues. The living room furniture is of cloth upholstery and had stains which should be treated with upholstery cleaner by the cleaning staff. There was also some sort of child's cereal, looked like Fruity Pebbles, scattered on the living room sectional and also under the balcony dining table, which I cleaned up. The bedspread in one of the guest bedrooms had a fairly long brown streak running across it. I called Liquid Life and they notified housekeeping to come change out all of the linens in that particular room.\n\nI am giving this condo a four out of five rating only because of the cleaning issues. Had the condo been cleaned properly, I would have easily given it a five. I have no complaints about Liquid Life Vacation Rentals. They took my concerns seriously and made everything right for us. I would, however,  like to see them follow up on the cleaning staff in the future.

This was our first time going with this particular company. Hurricane Sally hit and devasted Gulf Shores! We called and was going to reschedule our stay til next year but they didn't have the schedule for that far ahead. They kindly cancelled our reservation for us and told us how to get in touch with the travel insurance company. We have always took out the insurance but never had to use it. The travel insurance, Red Sky, was a whole other story. I done the claim on 9/24. I called and they said it could take up to 30 days to hear from the claim. I emailed them and never heard from them by email. I called on 10/2 and 10/14 and was told both times that it was being processed and I would hear from them as soon as a decision had been made. I received and email on 10/16 stating that my claim had been denied. I immediately called and was told since it had been 30 days since the hurricane hit, which was on 9/16, that the 30 days window had expired. It just seems odd how it was exactly 30 days since it hit that I receive the email. After talking with multiple people, including managers, I was just getting the run around and no answers. As I was on the phone with them, I had a missed called. It was Anita from Liquid Life and asked me to call them back. I called and before I could say anything, she said they received notification from Red Sky that our claim had been denied and she was just letting me know that Liquid Life was cutting me a check for the refund amount. This people shows how great of a company this is. Liquid Life was always helpful and made things right even when they didn't have too and they done it on their own.

The paperwork states that 3pm is when you can get into your room unless the cleaning person is still cleaning. I called Liquid Life to let them know we were there and ready to enter the condo. We were told by Liquid Life that the room would be ready at 4:30p.m. and they would give us codes to get in then. At 5:20p.m. I called them back and no one answered. At 5.40 p.m. I finally was able to reach someone and they sent the door code at 5:44p.m. When we got to the door there was no keypad to enter codes as it was a key card only. I called back and told them that we needed key cards and not codes. They seemed confused. Finally the owner of the company came around 6:45p.m. with cards to let us in and only gave us 1 key card. Someone came the next day in the afternoon and gave us 2 more cards. The condo was nice but the appliances were dated. The freezer door on the fridge would not shut properly due to a problem with the ice maker. A toilet seat was very loose and when we walked around on the floor barefoot the bottoms of our feet were black implying the floors had not been properly cleaned. When it was time to check out I asked Liquid Life if they could give us 2 more hours to check out so normal checkout is 10:00a.m. and I requested check out at 12:00pm since they had shorted us at least 2 hours at the beginning of the stay. They refused to allow us to check out at 12:00p.m. and said we had to be out by 10:a.m. All I received was a \"Sorry\".

While COVID-19 has impacted everyone in varying ways, we too have certainly had our own challenges to overcome, and we are sorry to see you were caught up in those challenges.\n\nOur policies do say check-in is at 3pm, and under some circumstances, we fall short of that exact time frame. We try to allow ample time to get our units clean, especially under these trying times. Regrettably, you and your family had to wait quite a bit longer than usual to get into your unit. Yes, there was some confusion as to if the unit was equipped with either a key card or Kaba lock. We\u2019ve been making adjustments to all of our units to have Kaba locks installed on each one. However, COVID-19 prevented our maintenance department from finishing installment of these locks, thus our reservation system had that unit marked with incorrect or unfinished key locks. I would like to point out that the owner of the company did, in fact, make time afterhours to bring an appropriate key card directly to you. We also had a member of our team bring you a set of keys the next morning.\n\nUnfortunately, there wasn\u2019t a guidebook or policy & procedures in place to handle an unforeseen event of this magnitude.\n\nAs a result of the rapidly changing COVID-19 environment, we were making quick decisions and operating our offices on a skeleton crew and were not able to react or respond in a way in which was appropriate for all given parties.\n\nWe have learned a valuable lesson over the past few months and realize that our responses and actions could have been handled differently.

I called earlier in the afternoon to inform Liquid Life we had arrived and was told I would get a text when our condo was ready.  We had gone grocery shopping for our week and now had $400 in groceries in our car for two hours. At 5 PM I called Liquid Life and inquired as to when the condo would be ready. I was told maintenance was tending to several issues so that the condo would be \u201cperfect\u201d for our arrival.  We got our text at 5:30 PM.   Even though I registered 10 guests we were given 5 keys but only 4 worked.  I was told by Liquid Life that I should check with the Caribe and they could give me more.  I had to buy more for $5 each.  We had to have maintenance come and fix the lock on the door.\nOnce in the condo as we were putting groceries away the refrigerator door would not stay shut.  The cleaning people had not put the drawers in properly.  I was going to cook dinner but the condo had no fry pans, a broken electric can opener, no manual can opener. There were no baking sheets, no pot holders, no spatulas.  The oven took 40 minutes to preheat to 400 degrees.   The blender had no lid.  I called Liquid Life to complain and the next day they did bring a new blender, fry pans, pot holders, can opener and baking sheets.\nThe bed in room 2 is a joke.  They actually have a mattress laying on a metal bed frame with no box spring or support.  The metal bed frame was also broken.  There is no way any one could sleep on this bed.  Liquid Life came and looked at it on Monday but did nothing to replace it.  We were told that it was furniture and it had to be approved by the owner.\nThe toilet in bedroom one would not quit running.  The toilet in the master bathroom overflowed all over the floor on Sunday morning. Maintenance came and fixed both but left the wet plastic he had in the trash.  We cleaned up the floor.  No one from housekeeping came to clean up the floor and sanitize it.  We used our towels, paper towels and disinfecting spray.\nWhen I booked the condo I registered 10 people.  Upon arrival we had 8 towels and washcloths in the unit.  I had to call and request more the first night. .  They brought 2 towels.   I must say they brought more after the toilet overflowed since I had to use ours to wipe up the floor.\nEach condo rental with Liquid Life is charged $189 cleaning fee.  Bedroom one has a shower curtain full of mold!!!  The shower in the master bedroom has mold all along the shower door and in corners.  We did take pictures and shared them with Liquid Life. Obviously things are not cleaned as they should be. There should be a checklist so nothing is missed.\nLiquid life offered me a $250 refund but to receive it I would have to sign an agreement that I and my family would not post any negative comments on any review, social media or Better Business Bureau. If I did they would charge my credit card on file for $250.  I declined.

Well we couldn't leave because part of the building had went through our windshield and we could not get it fixed until Thursday. Today we get a call that they are going to refund 1 night! Really, we had no lights for 3 days and no water for 1 and you want to only give a 1 night refund? Not to mention the over 10,000 dollars in damages to our car because luggage carts, trash cans, road signs and parts of the building  were breaking off hitting our car.

We believe we know what reservation you are speaking of, but we are not sure as we do not have you listed as the primary resident. Based on the information we have, it shows that you booked your stay on VRBO, and when you book on VRBO, you must accept or decline Travel Insurance on your stay. You also verify on VRBO that you accept our Guest Terms & Conditions, which outlines travel insurance and weather related issues. At the time you tried to reschedule, the storm was not even headed towards us - that changed within hours of the storm hitting land. No one expected this type of effect on our community. We also have on your file that you arrived on the 14th and were to depart on the 18th, so you only left one day early - which is why you were refunded for one day. Our team also did not ignore you while you were here. Our offices are across the street from the beach, very close to your condo complex. Every member of our team works and lives here locally. We all experienced the same storm you did, and there was no power, internet or phone service.

It is beautifully decorated and very stylish. It was very clean when we arrived. The elevators are kept clean and are very fast. The outside of the entire property is kept very clean and well-maintained even in this very busy season. The location is fantastic. You could walk to a few restaurants and to shopping.\n\nThe shower in the master bathroom is gorgeous. We all liked having the hand sprayer in addition to the regular shower head, especially at the beach. The water pressure is great in both bathrooms. The kitchen was stocked with everything our large group needed. The air conditioner keeps it nice and cold inside. We left our sandy beach stuff outside the door all week, and it was safe there. The balcony is awesome and huge.\n\nWe have stayed in condos every year when we go to the beach. This particular condo (1105A at Summer House) will be a repeat next year!

A speaker flew off the balcony and nearly hit us.  The back door wouldn't lock.  The garage door wouldn't close.  The wonderful part was how we called several times to have the trashed picked up and as we pulled away a week later, the 20 bags of stench and flies still sat there.  The fridge leaked.  The couch in the living room was sunken in.  The surround sound didn't work.  The kitchen faucet wouldn't shut off.  There were not enough bath towels, no laundry basket or dust pan (we bought one).  There was 1 dish towel and 1 wash rag, so we bought more.  It was missing the \"basics\" a family would need for a week.  We had to buy a bbq grill since the 2 on the back porch were a rusted mess.  The tv in several rooms didn't work (normally wouldn't have been a big deal but the beach was closed for several days and we were stuck in the house).  Several windows on the main floor leaked.  Overall the house was filthy with thick build up on the vents and a heavy layer of sand and dirt under the couch.  I attempted to clean but the vacuum cleaner didn't work.  This house is run down and in bad shape.  The worst part was management not being accountable.  It's obvious the owners don't live locally or care enough to properly give it the updates it sadly needs.  When we addressed the issues, management blew it off.  The maintenance man did fix the door and a/c later in the week but this house was not ready for visitors.  Management tried to validate each issue and offered no apology!  With comments like \"had we known the state of the grills, we would've replaced them\", it's clear nobody is claiming ownership.  How is a management company not aware that 2 rusted out grills with 1 leg, were shoved in the corner on the back porch?  Come on!!!  Someone should take a tour of the house to assure it's prepared for each guest and give it a deep clean.  Clearly, nobody cares so we don't care to ever rent from this company again.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF0NiN94ULkKZtackafuNWEnO2gFxCWlmWj3MM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1499087786320, "text": "Hi Shannon.

A repair guy showed up and said he woud get us a loaner. They did but it did not fit in the closet so it stuck out and we could not close door.. Second problem Refrigerator.  No ice on arrival, We went to grocery store bought $200 worth of groceries. Came back and put the food in the refrig.  Several hours later food warm, still no ice.  Called office and they said that it will take 24 hours for the refrig to get cold. They turn it off between renter. The said dont worry your food wont go bad. HA  We had warm drinks until the next morning. Friday they told me that they would send someone out that evening to look at the refrig. NO ONE ever showed up/ I have NEVER stayed in a condo where the refrig was not ready and working.  Putting groceries away. Kitchen was disgusting. Dried food on cabinets. HAIR and dirt in kitchen drawers. HAIR on top of utensils.  My son went to rest on couch and the throw pillows had dried blood on them. Curtains had dried body fluids -my guess vomit Called and complained and they sent someone to clean the kitchen. They removed the covers off the pillows and put the throw pillows in a closet. The next person that gets to stay there gets bloody throw pillows with a clean covering. They did nothing with the curtains. We got to live with those. Then I was making mac and cheese and found a dead roach in the cabinet. I got to call again!  Bug guy came and sprayed. GROSS>  They told me I had talked to almost everyone in the office and they are resolving our problems and what else do we want. They told me they would reach out Monday to make sure we were happy and things were going well. We checked out on Wednesday and never did we hear from the office staff.  Also the ice maker wasn't working. just dripping water on the floor .  They Sent someone out. They chipped away at some frozen ice around a gear and said it would work. Well it did not the whole time we were there, just dripped water so we just turned off the ice maker because this place is no help,  The last night we were there we saw roaches running in the kitchen by the laundry machine.  I gave up talking to the office because they obviously dont care. They just patch things up and hope people leave them alone.  I could not relax in the condo. It was so stressful. Oh we also were not allowed to hang our towels on the balcony railing. We had security telling us to take them down. Security also banged on our door one other time- they had the wrong condo.

We are staying here for 11 nights and paid over $4,000.  We came in on Tuesday which was the day Hurricane Gordon was hitting.  We called the office to ask if we could check in early as we had seen on the calendar that no one stayed in the unit Monday night.  The girl I spoke with was not helpful and just kept telling me their policy.  I knew what the policy was, what I was asking for was at least some effort to see if she could check when we would be able to get in.  She would not do it.  I ask to speak with her boss and she said she was out cleaning condos and did not have her number.  I asked to speak to one of the inspectors and she said she didn't have any of their numbers.  She never once offered to go above and beyond other than telling me what the policy was.  I had 3 kids in a car headed towards a tropical storm growing into a Hurricane and just wanted someone to say \"let me see what I can do\", but that did not happen.  We got the call at 2:45pm that our condo was ready, which we were waiting in the parking garage at the condo as the tropical storm had already began to hit.  Condo was clean and ready and then we noticed the stand alone ice maker was missing, like was not there and was just a blank space.  This is something that we love and use all the time when we stay at Phoenix West II.  I called Liquid Life and they said it was our for maintenance.  I explained that this is something that we use everyday and could they bring a spare one until the other got fixed.  She said they don't have spare ones and her solution was that if the refrigerator ice maker did not keep up, then I could go to the store, buy bagged ice and then bring them the receipt.  Really????  I just paid $4,000 for 11 nights and you want me to leave the condo to go buy bagged ice every time I need to fill the cooler and then bring you the receipt.....  I then called back and got another girl who said she would have maintenance call me the next day.  No one called and we are still here without a separate ice maker.  This is our 7th year to stay at either Phoenix West and/or Phoenix West II and we really enjoyed it.  Things happen and I realize that, but I don't believe stating policy when there is a Hurricane Warning in place and telling someone to go buy bagged ice is the right things to do in these situations.  I am not saying don't rent through Liquid Life, but I did want to share our current situation so you can make an educated decision.

NO RESPONSE. CLEARLY it was to save face because they never made it right.\n\n.  When I was on the way to the property they told me the Br ac was broke. We got here both ac was broke. The first night was a hot one. There was Sheetrock ripped off wall. Patch jobs gone wrong on ceiling. You could see the sheet rock because there was no curtains. By this time I had been asking for the Wi-Fi code for two days. Still not got it. A man came at four on Monday and fix the AC\u2019s. They sent two Boys to hang curtains because I had teenage girls changing in the living room since it\u2019s one bedroom. \u202aTuesday morning\u202c I woke up went down to my car and it had a notice that it was going to be towed. I contacted the property manager who told me I should have had a packet left in the room which I did not. Now, Still fighting for the wifi on Tuesday. Finally, someone showed up later that day to fix the Wi-Fi problem and bring a welcome packet so we could hang a sticker on her car Mirror. What should have a been a vacation from the stress I\u2019ve been through after recovering from open heart surgery last year along with 4 strokes and months of therapy turned into a stressful situation. Each day of the vacation I woke to a new problem and ended in tears fighting back and forth with liquid life. Anita was kind however. They offered me $250 back of the $1200 I paid. I didn\u2019t take it bc they wanted me to sign something saying I couldn\u2019t leave online reviews or go to social media or bbb. I did not feel that was fair to other people. After all, I still had one day right? What could go wrong? I saved all my washing for that day. When I went to dry the clothes the dryer did not dry. 4 turns on same load STILL not dry. I reported it to liquid life and they didn\u2019t respond. I saved the text just incase they said I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve literally had tears every day of my vacation. I\u2019ve tried to make the best of it as I\u2019m not suppose to be stressed. In my opinion they owe me a refund. Unit 16 at Perdido skye never should have been rented. I\u2019ve taken pics and hope I\u2019m able to share them. On a positive note it\u2019s convenient to elevator and the property has a nice pool, and is convenient to beach. Nice views. I wondered if it was the story for every unit in the building and it\u2019s not. I saw 54 online which was really nice! Probably managed better. The bottom line is unit 16 SHOULD NOT have been rented until it was ready. after not taking the $250 bc the wanted time to sign something saying I wouldn\u2019t talk on the experience, I reported this same thing to the bbb.  Their response was that they tried to offer me money and I came back 3 times for more.  Lies.  I was offered $205 and I said that wasn\u2019t a fair amount.  On the same phonecall we came up woth $250 just to be done, I Said ok.  The they sent the thing I had to sign saying I couldn\u2019t post anything to anyone on social media or the Better Business Bureau. I felt like this was not enough for me to sit back, shut up And watch other families get ripped off. Then I wake up the next day to a dryer that didn\u2019t work and they never sent anybody out to fix it. Glad I did not sign.

Costly mistake...I will not make again. Paid in full. Then, we received an email from LiquidLife before the start of our vacation saying our reservation/vacation was cancelled because the condo building (SeaChase) closed due to Covid 19. We received another email from VRBO saying our vacation was cancelled.  We did not cancel. LiquidLife cancelled on us. LiquidLife refused to refund our money even though VRBO urged for full refunds. Instead, LiquidLife offered 100% credit plus 20% discount for a future stay. Not ideal but it felt like an \"ok\" response. Today, in my mail, I received a check for a fraction of my money paid, as a partial refund. Apparently, LiquidLife switched from a 120% credit to a maybe 60% refund.  I emailed to ask why they were keeping hundreds of dollars of my money....The response I received was generic and unprofessional.

Again Tuesday and Wednesday before arrive called and left voicemails multiple times still nothing ! Got to our room we had no wristband which where paid for when reserving again called the office no answer. We went to the office at the resort and where told we would need to contact who we booked through or it\u2019s purchase new wristbands so we paid 13$ for more wristbands no biggy just 13$ but it\u2019s the simple fact of the inconvenience. After looking over the condo we noticed the slide door in the master bedroom was broken we could not open close or lock it. By 9:30 I finally called the after hours and Alex who was extremely nice contacted several people who did not answer once again. He then called a manager who told him he would have someone come fix the door first thing Thursday morning and also have someone call me . Thursday came still no call nor anyone to fix the door around 11;30 I called again and got someone of the phone who was very rude and informed me they where just to busy to return my call I should have emailed I then asked for a manager and was told she would email them and request them to call me and then  Click no I\u2019m sorry no bye no nothing !

They sent us an email at the beginning of April stating that we would receive a full credit (besides $98 processing fees) plus a 20% discount when we booked to replace our Spring Break trip that got cancelled due to COVID-19. We have this in writing and were told that we could contact them to rebook once Alabama beaches reopened.  This was totally fine with us because we wanted to rebook and enjoy our time in Orange Beach!  Just in time for the beaches to reopen, they mailed us a letter and a check that was for $656 less than what we paid them.  We contacted them to inquire about using the promised credit and discount and were told that was no longer an option.  No explanation as to why they felt it was necessary to keep our money.  We found it ironic that they wouldn\u2019t let us rebook with the credit since they\u2019re busy advertising multiple times a day on Facebook for people to contact them to make reservations.  You can\u2019t leave a review on their Facebook page and if you post a Facebook comment and reference this situation, someone from their staff deletes your comment within 5 minutes.

When we arrived we could see that major construction was going on, yet we were not advised of this, nor were we given an opportunity to switch buildings.  They came on the second day and draped our balcony in plastic sheeting to where we could not sit and look out at the water.  They also put up a large sheet of plywood blocking off over half of what balcony was left.  There was scaffolding going up and down all days from 9 to 5, with loud talking and banging of equipment.  This severely impacted our stay, and when I went to complain to the office they said there was nothing they could do, nor could they give me a discount for the inconvenience when I requested it.\nIn addition to this, the pool and hot tub in the Phoenix IV building was roped off and out of order for most of the week, so we had to go outside and next door to use the very crowded pool at hot tub at Phoenix III.\nUnit 4023 itself was nice and very spacious, which was needed for our group of family and cooking the Thanksgiving dinner.  However, the unit slept 10, but there was only one set of towels for 8, and only one dish cloth and dish towel in the kitchen, and NO hot pads at all.  We just kept washing them over and over.\nOne other thing:  Due to the construction, our TV reception was intermittently out most of the week.

We sincerely apologize that you had a disappointing week at the beach. Our goal is to make sure all of our guests have the best vacation possible. So, we take customer service very seriously. We looked in to your reservation and saw that you did come in to our office a few days in to your stay to let us know about the balcony and to see if there were any discounts if you booked with us again next year. Unfortunately, our team was correct and there was nothing they could do about the balcony but we certainly could have done something about the towels and hot pads had we known.

When we arrived we could see that major construction was going on, yet we were not advised of this, nor were we given an opportunity to switch buildings.  They came on the second day and draped our balcony in plastic sheeting to where we could not sit and look out at the water.  They also put up a large sheet of plywood blocking off over half of what balcony was left.  There was scaffolding going up and down all days from 9 to 5, with loud talking and banging of equipment.  This severely impacted our stay, and when I went to complain to the office they said there was nothing they could do, nor could they give me a discount for the inconvenience when I requested it.\nIn addition to this, the pool and hot tub in the Phoenix IV building was roped off and out of order for most of the week, so we had to go outside and next door to use the very crowded pool at hot tub at Phoenix III.\nUnit 4023 itself was nice and very spacious, which was needed for our group of family and cooking the Thanksgiving dinner.  However, the unit slept 10, but there was only one set of towels for 8, and only one dish cloth and dish towel in the kitchen, and NO hot pads at all.  We just kept washing them over and over.\nOne other thing:  Due to the construction, our TV reception was intermittently out most of the week.  We could not watch the Parade or football games I had planned.  All in all, it was a VERY disappointing week.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1511801199256, "text": "Hi Marilyn, Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review about your recent stay.

We are staying here for 11 nights and paid over $4,000.  We came in on Tuesday which was the day Hurricane Gordon was hitting.  We called the office to ask if we could check in early as we had seen on the calendar that no one stayed in the unit Monday night.  The girl I spoke with was not helpful and just kept telling me their policy.  I knew what the policy was, what I was asking for was at least some effort to see if she could check when we would be able to get in.  She would not do it.  I ask to speak with her boss and she said she was out cleaning condos and did not have her number.  I asked to speak to one of the inspectors and she said she didn't have any of their numbers.  She never once offered to go above and beyond other than telling me what the policy was.  I had 3 kids in a car headed towards a tropical storm growing into a Hurricane and just wanted someone to say \"let me see what I can do\", but that did not happen.  We got the call at 2:45pm that our condo was ready, which we were waiting in the parking garage at the condo as the tropical storm had already began to hit.  Condo was clean and ready and then we noticed the stand alone ice maker was missing, like was not there and was just a blank space.  This is something that we love and use all the time when we stay at Phoenix West II.  I called Liquid Life and they said it was our for maintenance.  I explained that this is something that we use everyday and could they bring a spare one until the other got fixed.  She said they don't have spare ones and her solution was that if the refrigerator ice maker did not keep up, then I could go to the store, buy bagged ice and then bring them the receipt.  Really????  I just paid $4,000 for 11 nights and you want me to leave the condo to go buy bagged ice every time I need to fill the cooler and then bring you the receipt.....  I then called back and got another girl who said she would have maintenance call me the next day.  No one called and we are still here without a separate ice maker.  This is our 7th year to stay at either Phoenix West and/or Phoenix West II and we really enjoyed it.  Things happen and I realize that, but I don't believe stating policy when there is a Hurricane Warning in place and telling someone to go buy bagged ice is the right things to do in these situations.  I am not saying don't rent through Liquid Life, but I did want to share our current situation so you can make an educated decision.  I even mentioned to the front desk here that we were trying to get checked in early due to the approaching storm and when I told them who I rented through they rolled their eyes like there was a history there with Liquid Life and these kind of issues.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGSNg59boQqmjle6-ZO9gyWeH0tR3kLN8VhYp5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1536247802374, "text": "Josh,  Thanks for writing.

I think giving a 3 rating is being kind and only because I enjoyed being at the beach. To start when we arrived the code that was given to us to get into the condo was incorrect, we called and they had to reset it so we had to wait outside of our room for 10 mins, wouldn\u2019t have been that big of a deal if we had not already unpacked our vehicle and had our belongings sitting outside the door so we couldn't just go ride around or explore the facility while we waited. Secondly as soon as we walked in we noticed the sand all over the floors, now I understand that we are at the beach but I expect to walk into a clean condo when I first arrive. There was also sand on the counters and on the comforters on each bed, dried food on the floor, and hair in the shower, tubs, and dryer so I do not feel this place was cleaned well/if at all! Granted they did offer to send someone to come clean it again but one if they did that poorly the first time what good is that going to do it is not like they were rushed because there was no one renting the place the entire day prior and secondly we already had all of our belongings unpacked by the time I received a call back the next day. There are a few other things such as not having a WiFi password in the room and having to text back and forth several time to get it, Being told twice it was open, not the case it was locked and required password, the large roach that came out from under the kitchen counter, oil on utensils, plus other disappointing factors. This is not a knock towards SeaChase whatsoever, we have stayed there before and room was great, the facility is wonderful itself!

We\u2019ve stayed at this facility in different units previous years and have had no issues. This year was quite different than in past years. The unit was clean and looked to have been somewhat updated in recent months. Unfortunately, the beds were extremely uncomfortable and it made the entire week there somewhat disappointing. Neither my husband nor I are picky with mattresses, but the mattresses provided to us were TERRIBLE!  None of us were able to get any rest at night due to the thin mattresses with lumps and springs poking into our backs. When I reached out to customer service we were told that they would send someone from their Quality Assurance department over to inspect them that day. No one ever came to look at them and when I contacted customer service again I was told that they were waiting for the owner of the unit to approve mattress replacements. That was on Tuesday and we never heard back from anyone with Liquid Life Vacation Rentals. I made three separate attempts to get the issue resolved and they didn\u2019t give the common courtesy to rectify the problem. This was by far the worst customer service we\u2019ve ever experienced while  vacationing in Gulf Shores. My suggestion is to try either Meyer or Kaiser vacation Rentals. We\u2019ve used both in the past and had to request service once with each and they both addresses our concerns immediately. I will update the review when or if Liquid Life decides to acknowledge the problems we experienced.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f95e0f40cd:0x357d2c5a26b9a07b"}

The furniture was clean and seemed new. The overall amenities were nice(TV, washer/dryer, dishwasher etc). We have been traveling to Orange Beach for 13 of the past 14 years and we really enjoy staying at the Phoenix V. This is the first stay with Liquid Life Rentals, and, I would look to stay at this or another Liquid Life rental in the future. The check in was a breeze and the people working the desk were focused on us.  There were a few improvements that could enhance the stay.  The internet connectivity was sketchy, the main door seal was not very secure so when the wind blew(and it blows constantly) there was a whistling that could be heard in the back two bedrooms and the third bedroom did not have a television at the time of our stay. These are minor issues in my view.

The location of the unit was good and the owners of the unit were thoughtful enough to leave innertubes, boogie boards, chairs etc.. in the closet outside of the unit for guests to use.\n\nThe unit itself was decorated nicely. During our visit there were a few minor issues. The cable from the wall to the modem was disconnected so had to sort that out. The toilet paper holder in the master bath was falling off the wall. It was obvious that the housekeeper(s) do not take a great deal of pride in what their work (spatulas, slotted spoons, can openers etc were disorganized in drawers. the AC return was very dirty, glass door on patio had fingerprints on it, hair on the bathroom wall etc...).\n\nThe parking at the unit can be a challenge if you are not in by 8 or 9 PM. There are a very limited number of spots for the number of units in the building and if the lot is full, you will have to park across the street. Not a big deal since you can drop your bags and groceries off right at the entrance to the complex and then park and walk across the street.

First let me say the unit was lovely and we did enjoy our stay but we do have a few major concerns\n\n\u2014first We did have a small issue with cleanliness. Obviously we pay the CLEANING fee So I assume those who stayed before us paid the same but there were several areas that were not clean. But Counter still had some residue on them. The floors didn\u2019t look mopped and if they were it was done very poorly. You could still see areas where drinks were dropped and partially cleaned up but there was still stickiness etc. We cleaned up ourselves.   If we\u2019re going to pay a cleaning fee I would hope the cleaning would occur better than that.\n\n\u2014 The BIGGEST ISSUE  is we learned a third-party individual gained access to our condo while we were out at the beach.    First let me say we stay at this condo because we have to close friends who both owned condos nearby.  By pure coincidence we were at the beach with our friends   And other acquaintances who live there full time.  One of which realized the unit we were in and told us he entered the unit earlier that day at the request of the OWERS BUT WITHOUT LIQUID LIFE KNOWING. HE SAID THE OWNERS GAVE HIM THE OWNERS CODE AND ASKED HIM TO CHECK ON THEIR OWNERS CLOSET.   This was of course during our stay we just happen to not to be there at the time.  This came across a bit concerning to us that a third-party was given private access to the condo we were currently staying in and somebody visited while we were not there. LET ME REPEAT.  LIQUID LIFE LET A STRANGER ACCESS THE CONDO WHILE WE WERE THERE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE. We have no reason to believe anything occurred but it\u2019s a bit unnerving knowing somebody was allowed in without our knowledge.\nWhat if we were there?? And some stranger just walked in?  We also had three young teenage girls with us who could\u2019ve been there by themselves.   Is this normal practice?\n\n\u2014Lastly we had a bit of an issue with the checkout process. Liquid life contacted us through text asking if we wanted to add an extra night to our trip which which r liquid Life contacted us through text asking if we wanted to add an extra night to our trip which we chose to do. Essentially we would leave on Sunday versus Saturday as we had planned.  But even though we had arranged this apparently the texting system and code system were unaware.  We kept receiving check out texts and eventually we were locked out of our unit because the system was not updated. We called the office who did rectify this immediately and did a great job  correcting the  error but was inconvenient. Also one note on Saturday morning around 9am  A gentleman with a Liquid Life shirt attempted to enter the unit.   Thankfully we had done the bolts so he was unable to access.  We answered the door and he was surprised to see someone thinking the unit was empty.   So  we assumed he was not notified of our extra night but just us concerning he showed up at 9 AM when our checkout time was not until 10 AM even if that was the day we were leaving.\n\nThe unit and location were great.   The concern is more about the operations of Liquid Life.\n\nI contact liquid life with our concerns through email and through their own survey but have never been contacted to discuss or apologize.

We recently stayed at Phoenix West,  booked through liquid life. Upon arriving at the condo we found the blender was broken.  We went to the front desk asking for a replacement and the desk person told us you didn\u2019t book through Brett Robinson call liquid life and get them to help. Then we realized upon going to bed that the bed in the master bedroom was broken. Two of three wooden slats underneath the bed were cracked in multiple places so we immediately took pictures and called it in. All the while upon traveling down, my dad who booked the room had agreed to allow a real estate showing at 10 am on our second morning. Who does that?  Charge someone 600 per night then ask if they can show the place to a prospective buyer?  He actually had agreed but upon the 2 problems and the treatment from the desk person decided he was unwilling to work with them. He waited in the room half of the first day waiting on someone to fix the bed after he had to sleep on a broken bed the night before. What a way to spend VACATION time.  Next day the refrigerator went out. We called first thing in the morning and were told to place the setting to 5 and wait. We did then called back after a few hours of a hot refrigerator  we were told someone would be out within 3 hours to fix it. I personally called back and explained we had food about to go bad because we had followed their instructions to no avail. Between 30 min to an hour later a fridge repair person came and used a hair dryer to defrost the fridge and changed a part on the fridge.  Upon returning home my dad called to share his experience with liquid life and was basically told that we were at fault because we put too much in the fridge and that the repair man told them nothing was wrong with the fridge. He WATCHED the guy change parts.\n\nIn short the unit should have been in working order for the entire stay and these oversights and other reviews lead me to believe liquid life does not have your vacation enjoyment at the forefront. Book with someone else.  I kinda understand why Brett Robinson people were unwilling to assist. I bet they deal with this daily.\n\nUPDATE:  please see owner\u2019s unprofessional response.\n\nYou would think the owner of a reputable company would have gathered facts before responding to a customer review and making false public accusations.  Your response appears to indicate we are still at the beach. We left 3 days ago. The only contact I have had with your company was a phone call regarding the refrigerator and my online reviews of our experience. Based upon my experience I don\u2019t expect to contact your company in the future.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ve not sent a single email, I was on a trip with my family and this is what I personally witnessed.\n\nSecondly \u201cobsessing\u201d about spending 2400 for 4 days and have multiple issues, clearly your view and mine differ here. I believe expecting to have a bed in working order prior to arrival is reasonable.\n\nThirdly, I\u2019m not sure what you consider \u201clong after\u201d issues are resolved. Addressing issues within a week of departure seems like a reasonable timeframe to me.\n\nFourth, my father watched the repair person change parts on a refrigerator that \u201cfelt hot\u201d. I guess my dad imagined that or he has decided after 60 plus years of life to become a liar as he was accused of by this company.\n\nThank you to the owner for confirming my decision to leave a review. Do yourself a favor and book elsewhere. Look at the responses to 1 star reviews throughout and you will see a company that makes nothing but excuses.\n\nWe certainly would have spent the money on someone else\u2019s 14 year old working condo had we known this team would have failed so badly and not care.  Based on the number of 1 star reviews here, on Facebook and the response from the owner I think the \u201cbad behavior\u201d does show itself. We are in agreement there. Your response is a clear cut example.\n\nU2: Maybe verifying names could offer additional clarity on the email mix up.  Wouldn't expect you to pay close attention based on my experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532476869094, "text": "Chad, I have watched the emails flying around from you.

We host 10,000 families a year, which means we have lots of opportunities to help people navigate arriving at a condo and loading it with groceries and then \"feeling\" like it's hot. Vacation use is not home use. We get this. We responded immediately to the blender and the other issue. Again, I have watched the way you have communicated with my team, and I have watched the names and threats. Bad behavior is bad behavior, and it sticks out. I am the owner of the company. I watched the issues and the emails and our responses. I would have gotten involved, but my team did a perfect job. Life happens. Stuff breaks. You rented a very nice, yet 14-year-old, condo. We fix things, and we take care of guests. There is a beach out there that you are missing while you are focused on emailing my staff long after all the issues were resolved promptly.

We have rented from them on several occasions and will continue to do so. Unfortunately, my horrible experience is reflecting on you all because of the worst customer service I have ever experienced was displayed by a Bella Luna employee. We chose to give Bella Luna a try for our summer family vacation this year instead of staying at Phoenix West II, as we visit Orange Beach several times a year. We all immediately fell in love with the property and love all that it has to offer. The unit was decorated beautifully, the beds were all comfortable, the bed linens were beautiful as was the furniture. The unit was large and spacious and worked well for our entire party! We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Bella Luna until our last night there when we encountered an employee named \"Joe\" in the pool area. First, I FULLY understand that there are rules to follow as we have not had a single problem following them AT ALL during our stay. The kids were swimming and 5 of the adults were sitting around a table next to the pool chatting. We weren't being loud, obnoxious, or disorderly at all. Joe came and told us that we had 5 minutes until he was closing down the pool. We immediately began to gather our belongings and started making our way to the boat dock to assist family members with getting on their boat to take it to a launch area to go ahead and load it up as Bella Luna doesn't offer an actual launch. Joe stopped me and in an extremely rude manner started questioning me as to what we were doing and what unit we were in and so on. I explained to him that we were helping them get their boat launched real quick and that we would be back in just a minute and asked if he could hold the door for me. He told me I had 3 mins (which was the 3 minutes left until the pool closed) and if we weren't back, we would all be locked out. I'll spare you the rest of the ugliness that ensued as he yelled at me from across the pool area while I was walking down the boat dock. All I asked of him was for a tiny bit of compassion from him to hold the door for us for 2 minutes while we helped our family get on the boat and untied from the dock. I wasn\u2019t asking him to break any rules that would be detrimental to the establishment or anyone else for that matter. HE LOCKED US OUT! This place is a vacation town in the south where the hospitality should be nothing short of superior. ESPECIALLY in a hospitality area, there is NEVER EVER an exception for the lack of or poor customer service! I chose to spend a decent amount of money to stay here at Bell Luna. We have thoroughly enjoyed the property itself until we crossed paths with him. What has me more upset than anything, is the fact that he completely and utterly disrespected me in front of my children, my family, as well as all of the other patrons at the pool this evening. In my honest opinion, Joe lacks every single thing that it takes for someone to posses employment in the hospitality profession. It is blatantly obvious that he is miserable and does not like his job. He should seek employment elsewhere that does not deal with the general public, especially the hospitality industry. Not only that,  Bella Luna as a company should take action by reprimanding him or no longer employing him. Upon check out today, I spoke with the girls at the Liquid Life and they were FULLY aware of who Joe was, his complete lack of hospitality, and his wrath of rudeness as they have had several complaints on him. Shame on Bella Luna for continuing to employ someone of his magnitude especially after so many complaints! We WILL NOT be patronizing Bella Luna again as long as they choose to employ anyone of his magnitude. I couldn\u2019t fathom enduring his wrath of rudeness again in the future nor could I fathom any of my family or friends having to endure it as well. Due to his actions, they have not only lost a patron, but a former patron who will be sure to let everyone know about my experience here with \u201cJoe\u201d and will definitely encourage anyone else to choose to spend their money elsewhere!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532006409319, "text": "Kristin, we are so very sorry for this experience you had at Bella Luna!

This is the point where you find out what kind of agency you\u2019re renting from - we had always gotten competitive rates for the rentals, so I always questioned in the back of my mind if Liquid Life\u2019s customer service would be lacking.  I went to the office and explained what was going on.  Becky was very friendly and apologetic about the issue, and she had us moved to a different condo in an hour.  We have since fallen in love with the other unit and have booked it for a week next year.  This experience had made us very loyal Liquid Life customers, and we\u2019ll think twice before renting from an individual on vrbo, homeaway, etc in the future since an individual has very little they can do when there\u2019s a major issue with a unit.  There\u2019s always a chance that there can be an issue with any unit - I don\u2019t fault Liquid Life for that - the key is what is done about the problem.

I think we had a few mishaps the first time but we ironed those out quick. I would like to speak on our recent stay this past week at Phoenix West 2 (Unit 704). The Unit had a beautiful view and I give the decor a 3.5 out of 5.0. The problems that we did have were based on the the cleaning service that is being used that is not completely checking this unit like they should. My mother being a Housekeeping manager for a 5 star hotel found it all lol. Trash under chairs, couches and tables....dishes and cooking utensils were not clean (possible salmonella poisoning could happen).....came across a few silverfish (which is typical for coastal areas) and the conditions of the bathing towels were mid level. I really hate leaving this review but at the same time this is things the property owner should know about considering they may be paying someone to keep these things up to par. I will say that I paid 35% more than the unit we had last year at the Bella Luna and it doesn't stand up to it other than the view of the gulf. I really recommend this unit to others but just fix these things and I guarantee this will be a great condo for and family.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1460477748435, "text": "Hi Jonathan!

The condo and staff were super friendly, clean, roomy and ofcourse Orange Beach is the Best.  One good note also I read on previous post how elevators were slow or broke at Phonex West 2.  Haaa haaa, these were the faster elevators I've ever been on. I've traveled the world folks.  These were nice. We were on the 24th out of 32.  No issues.  There's a trick to parking also. Ya don't have to go all the way to 12th floor. You can catch blazing fast elevator on all floors. Driving all the way to 12th gets dizzy. We allways found one/two on 3rd floor. Parking pass is 38$ but this place is super clean and safe lots of security. Very family friendly. I don't like waring arm band but for the secure location I didn't mind.

Imagine living through one of the worst winters ever.  Subzero temperatures. 12 inches of snow attached to a 29 mile long drive to work SEVERAL TIMES.  More snow so your drive home goes from 45 minutes to over 3 hours.  Plus... knowing that you are ready to make the move south.  The date of departure from the frozen tundra looms. 4 days until you hit the road to paradise.  Then, BOOM, an email... We are so sorry,  but the unit that you have booked is in need of immediate maintenance. But wait... we have moved you to another complex.  No ocean view but we think you will like it. I EXPLODED!!!!  I immediately called Liquid Life. Not a whole lot they could do for me. But they could refund me totally.  They tried to give me a description of the new place they were sending me to but I did not even want to listen.  I needed to get away and I just felt like maybe I should cancel the whole trip.  But I didn't.  I sent an absolutely horrific email to the owner of Liquid Life.  I received a phone call back from him within 1/2 hour.  They did come up with an answer. I could stay at 'the new place' for 4 days and then move to the original complex I booked.  NOT THE UNIT I BOOKED but the same complex. I agreed.  After driving for 2 days, we arrive at Liquid Life after hours.  There in the lock box was my packet.  The condo they chose for me was in the Caribe complex, on the intracoastal waterway.  We opened the door and entered PARADISE. I should have listened to the Liquid Life family when they were trying to explain the complex.  7 pools. so many Jacuzzis that you don't have time to use them all.  a restaurant with music serenading you through the most incredible sunset. The unit was pristine. The view was spectacular. The 4 days came and went in a heartbeat.  Then... The move... Over to the complex that I had originally booked.  I opened the door and was horrified.  It was like visiting the 1970's.  Bright yellow walls. So much so that you needed sunglasses. Burlap covered boxes for end tables. The view was on the interior curve of the building and when on the balcony, you could peer into the condos beside you. I burst into tears.  Everything was packed still in my car.  I was going to leave and drive home.  I called Liquid Life.  With some stroke of luck, the unit I just left, was available for the 10 days that I had left on my vacation.  I paid them a 'refresh' fee... FAIR... and moved back to paradise.  My son and his family arrived that night and the next 10 days were filled with kayaking, dolphin cruises, swimming, walking the beach, pools, hot tubs, eating. UGH... the eating. I am still full. The whole staff at Liquid Life could not have done more to try and accommodate me.  I have already booked my stay for next year.

The bottoms of our feet were black after walking bare foot for a few minutes, so much so that we took it upon ourselves to mop the floor with plain water (all we had) to help. We called to inform liquid life of the condition of our room the next morning and they were extremely dismissive stating \"We called too late to get our deposit back.\" We were not interested in getting our deposit back. We felt that if you pay a company to do a job (clean the rooms) then you would probably want to know if they weren't performing said job. The lady on the phone was annoyed with our call and asked if we wanted them to send another cleaner out. Umm, no. I don't want someone from a company who is clearly not happy with my complaint to send someone into a condo with all of my belongings to reclean. The room is supposed to be clean BEFORE we arrive.

The complete lack of caring about the customer\u2019s needs or any desire to make sure the customer gets what they payed for and expected to enjoy. We rented Florencia unit 708 from Liquid Life for the period of Oct 31- Dec15. We rented this condo with the primary purpose of entertaining our family that lives in the area as well as others visiting from out of state for the Thanksgiving Holiday Weekend. When we arrived we found the condo to be absolutely gorgeous and perfect for our plans. Three days after we arrived my wife tried to use the oven to cook some breakfast pastries and discovered it was inoperative. We called Liquid Life and informed them. On the same day a maintenance man showed up to service the fire extinguishers. We informed him about the oven he agreed it was broke and called his supervisor who did not respond. He said he would pass this along. Several days later we had still not recieved any response and contnued to call the office. After about a week an appliance man showed up and ordered a part said it would take a few days. My wife informed him about our plans to cook for Thansgiving, he said would definitely be fixed by then. Meanwhile we had no oven to cook meals for ourselves and incurred extra costs eating out with a fridge full of food we couldnt cook. The week of Thanksgiving arrived three weeks later. Still no oven, Liquid Life keeps telling us no worries, they will purchase a new oven if neccesary. On Wednesday we are frantic I call them at 3pm for fourth time that day a manager gets on the phone and tells us the best they could do is move us to another condo 5 miles away. I tell them this is unacceptable we have to leave for the airport to pick up guests that are arriving for the holiday. They tell me they will try to find another stove. My wife is crying she cant do all the baking she had planned. At 7 pm they show up with a stove they took from some other condo. It works but they tell me they have to leave the broken one in the middle of my living room. Mind you this is all occuring 3 weeks after the problem was first reported. We had our holiday and a week later the broke stove was stll in the middle of my living space. Thats when I wrote the owner of Liquid Life an email about what a joke his company is. He called me back and the first thing he does  is make a derogotory remark about my hispanic last name. He gives me his sincerest apologies but offers no compensation for our stress and inconvenience. Promise to get broken stove out right away but even that takes another two days. Took them four weeks to fix the problem and the whole time made it sound like we were somehow too demanding.

We appreciate you taking the time to give us feedback about your recent stay. We take customer service very seriously and genuinely care about each one of our guests. We are extremely sorry you feel differently about that and would like to start by addressing the some of your concerns like your comment about the \"derogatory remark about my hispanic name\". Our Chief Operations Officer returned your call and asked how to properly pronounce your last name so he wouldn't insult you by saying it improperly. It was never his intention to be derogatory. You are completely correct about the length of time it took to reach a resolution about the oven. We take full responsibility for not communicating with you on how long the process would take to order and replace the necessary part to fix the oven as we were dealing with the Bosch warranty department.  Unfortunately, our management team was notified of this situation the day before Thanksgiving. Knowing you could not have a successful and happy Thanksgiving without one, and we could not find a replacement on that day, our owner relations manager donated her own personal oven for you and your family to use. It was never our intention for the broken oven to be left in the living room or left as long as it was. Our maintenance team was instructed by one of the guests to leave it. Once our management team was notified that the oven was still in the living room, we made arrangements for it to be removed. Due to weather restrictions it took additional time we were not expecting.  We hope that the rest of your stay was enjoyable.

When I booked a condo at the Phoenix X I did so because of the indoor pool for my grandchildren.  I booked it within less than 30 days of arrival.  About 7-10 days after booking I received a text informing me the pool would be closed for maintenance.  I  immediately called Liquid Life and requested to be moved to a different facility telling them about my small grandchildren.  The person at LIquid Life quickly informed me that I was within 30 days of arrival and as per policy I could not be moved.  She just kept wanting to recite  \"Policy\". S he also informed me that they did not have to provide a place with a pool because they are not responsible for maintenance issues but they had made arrangements for people to use the indoor pool at the Phoenix IX which was just next door and that we could walk there.  Again I explained that this time of year and with small children I preferred a place with an indoor pool for convenience.  She only spouted the policy.  Not one time did she make any effort to relocate me.  I requested to speak with the manager--I was sent a text explaining their \"policy\".  So much for customer service!\n\nUpon my arrival at the Phoenix X I discovered the distance between the Phoenix X and IX was .2 mile.  Also the people I met the one time we used the indoor pool informed me that they originally had reservations at the Phoenix x and was offered a relocation to the Phoenix IX for a $30 transfer fee by a different travel agency. I would have gladly paid a transfer fee.\n\nThe Phoenix X condo was very nice with a beautiful view.  Yes, I will continue to stay at the Phoenix Condos but will never again use LiquidLife.  They did not try to meet the needs of their customer that had booked a reservation in good faith.\n\nIn  2016 I had booked a condo through Liquid Life for Spring break and they called and informed me that the unit I had rented was withdrawn by the owner.  Liquid life could not find me another Condo with the same number of bedrooms/bathrooms for the price--wanted me to pay several hundred dollars more which I could not afford so they refunded my money. In surfing the internet I found the condo I had rented--just listed with a new realty agency.\nJackie Doubleman, Cullman, Al", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1510758009589, "text": "Hi Jackie. Thank you for leaving us a review about your recent stay. We appreciate and encourage feedback from all of our guests. We sincerely apologize about the indoor pool being closed during your visit. We were unaware the indoor pool was going to be closed when you booked your reservation and we notified you as soon as we found out. Our terms and conditions state that we can not guarantee amenities at complexes. This is the case because we only manage the condo you are in and not the complex as a whole. We tried our best to find a solution for you by offering the indoor pool at Phoenix IX which is a 3 minute walk from Phoenix X. We take customer service very seriously and apologize that we made it seem as if we were not concerned with your vacation. If you were not able to use any pools at the complex we would have helped make other accommodations for you. The outside pool was open through your entire stay and the weather was warm and beautiful. We want all of our guests to have the best vacation possible. We will talk with our team to ensure they are delivering our policies in a manor which is kind and understandable. Thank you again for your review."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f95e0f40cd:0x357d2c5a26b9a07b"}

After arriving we were horrified that the pics were deceiving! Apparently the pics were taken over 10 years ago and this condo has not been taken care of! Paint missing from walls, very old and dirty furniture and baseboards, and even the outdoor chairs were all stained up! It was also top layer dirty with food in the sink and the toilet seats were dirty. House cleaning lady came to the room and she said \"oh I'm so sorry, but I didn't clean this room\"! After speaking with Brittany with Liquidlife, she kindly apologized and moved us to condo 1107 after she had house cleaning make double sure it was clean. Although this condo was cleaner on the top layer than our original condo it was still not in any condition to be rented and the pics of it online are very deceiving as well. We could not enjoy ourselves for many reasons but the BAD smell in there was the biggest reason! Upon first entering the room it smelled like air freshener which had a nice scent. But within 30 or so minutes the stench was present and it never left! It smelled like wet stinking socks! We assumed it was coming from the old nasty \"shag\" carpet that was wet over a 10 yr period and now mildewed. We left the sliding doors open day and night for a fresh breeeze! Of course when the doors are open the AC cuts off but we didn't care! We chose fresh air over the funk! I spoke with Brittany about the horrific smell and she offered to have housecleaning come and spray something to help! LOL! Hence is why it initially smelled like air freshener! I told her thanks but no thanks! The furniture was so old and nasty we lined them with sheets to sit on. Outdoor furniture equally old and nasty. The dryer made a very loud noise while in use even with the laundry room door closed and the people in the condo above us were drilling to remove tile from that condo. I spoke with Brittany \"again\" regarding the upstairs noise and she said \"I\"m sorry they are removing tile and they are allowed to work from 9-5 on it\"! I left out many BAD things about both of these condos! If I wrote them all this would look like a novel! We had looked forward to a nice vacation and this was a nightmare vacation! I spoke with the owner of Liquidlife, Randy who was also kind but no help! He said he was sorry the condo we rented was so run down. He said they are privately owned and haven't been updated since they were built in 2006 and he cant make them update them! He said next time we should find a condo thats just been built like the Phoenix 2! On the bright side we didn't get bedbugs but we didn't even get in the jacuzzi tub in our room knowing what we knew and what we smelled! We had bad vibes from it and it was a costly lesson to us! You couldn't offer us to stay again there for free! This experience left a BAD taste (and smell) in our mouth and nose with condo rentals! You don't always get what you think you're paying for! You've been warned! Wish we had been warned! We tried to put a review on the Liquidlife website on these 2 BAD rooms but we weren't able because how convenient for them they have no place to write any reviews! Hence the reviews are 5 stars! LOL BUT NOT! It's like FAKE NEWS! But FAKE REVIEWS!!! Shame on them!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493739765454, "text": "Hi Gary, thank you for your honest review. We appreciate any and all feedback and take that feedback seriously. We do apologize that the pictures of Lighthouse 516 were deceiving to you. We did look in to the the last time they were updated and new pictures were uploaded to our site in February. As soon as we were notified that you were unhappy in your unit we immediately got to work to right the wrong and help you enjoy your vacation. The property we moved you to had just had a check out so we sent our inspectors there to inspect it before your arrival, like we do for all of our properties before a check in. We stayed in constant contact with you throughout the day to make sure your needs were met. Two days after being in the new unit we received a call from you about loud noise above you and about a smell. Brittany called the front desk of the complex and they did inform her that new owners were replacing floors and that they were allowed to work on it until 5 pm. She then offered to send housekeeping or maintenance out to help with the smell and to find the source of the smell to which you declined. The reviews on our website are not fake reviews. All of our reviews come from comment cards that are in your check in package and VRBO. We will use your review as training material for our team moving forward. Again, we appreciate your review and hope that in the future you will allow us the opportunity to provide you with a 5 star experience."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f95e0f40cd:0x357d2c5a26b9a07b"}

We were in town 3 hours earlier than the 3 pm check-in time and tried to call to see if unit might be ready and no one answered the phone at Liquid Life (This is what I was instructed to do the day before when I got a confirmation call).  So, we went to public beach access and parking lot was full so we drove to Four Seasons and talked to the gate house worker who had us on the list to check in the 24th and let us go ahead and park and gave us the code to the beach access gate, which was very nice of him.\n\nHe told us that the cleaning person should surely be done with our unit because they got there around 10 am and it was close to 1 pm, by this time.   So we tried calling Liquid Life again and still got no answer.  We drove to Liquid Life and there were 2 people working in their office. The one we spoke with said the cleaning wasn't complete but took our number and said they would call us just as soon as it was ready.   By 330, we still hadn't gotten a call, so we called back and they said that the cleaning was done, but there had to be an inspection completed before we could check in.  She said she would call us when it was complete.  It was about 4 pm when we finally got the call that we could check in.  So then we drove back to Liquid Life rental office and picked up the keys.\n\nUpon entering the Four Seasons building, it appeared to be a little run down and the elevator reeked of some smell that was present all week.  Fortunately, when we opened the door, the unit was very nice and well-equipped, but not overly clean (considering the length of cleaning time).   We had been told by the gate-keeper that it was probably their nicest unit there and that it had recently been renovated.\n\nThe furnishings, bedding, d\u00e9cor and such were lovely!  And the balcony was nicely furnished and the view was beautiful, so we were very thankful for this!   The vertical blinds at all three sliding door exits to the balcony did not work properly and we finally just got them open as much as we could and just left them open so we didn't have to fight with them.  We also learned quickly that the bedroom door on the master would automatically lock if it got pulled or blew closed, so we had to put duct tape over the latch, because we didn't see a key to it anywhere and none was mentioned.  Luckily we had opened the door to the patio before this happened initially, so we could go around and open that door back up.\n\nWe also had to call Liquid Life again that evening regarding the Wi-Fi connection and password.  They were not what we were given in our check in packet, but they were able to work that out for us by phone, so we were able to access that and that was much appreciated.\n\nThe most frustrating thing that we dealt with all week was that the gate to the beach access.  It had a very old push button bar and a code to punch in, but it very rarely worked properly....Almost every single time, we would have to punch it in numerous times, and then it would finally open.  This was both going in and coming out.  At one point, luckily the site manager was back by the pool and came and let me in.  I helped another older lady get in a couple of times because she was having issues with it too.\n\nAll in all, we had a week of beautiful beaches and sunshine and made some super memories with some family and friends. We were very thankful for the mostly perfect weather and the lovely condition of the beach. The pool area wasn't much and we never found a hot tub anywhere on the property.  The jetted tub in the Master barely worked.  There were reportedly exercise facilities, but you had to go out to the gate house to get someone to let you in each time if you wished to use them.  I think the real issue with this particular unit/resort is that there really isn't an office or anyone readily accessible if you need something, as we have been accustomed to at other locations.  We used Liquid Life last year for a visit to the Turquoise and that trip was just fine!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1464185659603, "text": "Hi Sherri. Thank you for taking the time to review us. We are glad to hear you enjoyed your vacation here in Orange Beach. This time of year can be very busy, and our housecleaners and quality assurance team work hard to ensure that every unit receives their best attention. As stated in our policies and procedures, check in begins at 3pm and our reservations staff maintains constant communication with the cleaning crew to make sure we get our guests to their units as soon as we possibly can. We put in a work order upon your departure regarding the information about the vertical blinds and the door problems. Thank you so much for letting us know! It is rare for a condominium here at the beach to staff a front desk team, as almost all units are privately owned and managed by outsourced vacation rental companies. We agree that it is convenient when the association is readily staffed for instances such as the beach gate issue at Four Seasons. This is a luxury you will find at other premium properties in the area, such as Turquoise Place. Thank you again for all the helpful information, Sherri. We appreciate you and your business.

We weren\u2019t able to check in until 4:00 but they did warn us check in \u201cafter 3:00\u201d was possible. There was a strong nasty odor when we entered the condo. There were gnats and mosquitos flying everywhere upon arrival. They were in the sink, dishwasher, closets, kitchen ceiling, laundry closet, bathrooms, and bedrooms. The vinyl shower curtains were completely mildewed. We immediately called Liquid Life and asked to be moved but they had no availability. They said they would send someone out that night to spray for the bugs and to replace the vinyl shower curtains. After returning from dinner, no one had come to spray for bugs but the shower curtains had been replaced. While taking showers that night, neither tub would drain. I called again and they sent someone the next morning to snake the tubs and put a \u201ccleaner\u201d in the kitchen sink for the bugs. This didn\u2019t work on the bugs. The baseboards throughout the condo are covered in dirt. The cloth shower curtain in the master bath has either feces, dirt, blood, or makeup stains on it. The vent in the master bath has black mold and mildew all around it. There were dirty dishes in the kitchen cabinets and drawers. The cabinets felt greasy. Thankfully we brought paper plates and plastic utensils and plastic cups. The couch was covered in sand. The living room chairs are uncomfortable and grossly stained. The second bathroom toilet had to be plunged constantly. We bought a candle at Walgreens to try and drown out the smell of the condo. The carpet in the master bedroom smells like urine. The noise from upstairs was terrible. You can hear people simply walking. The noise from the pool was ridiculous and there was no privacy. There\u2019s a constant sound in the master bedroom that comes on constantly for 45 seconds and stops for 10 seconds. Almost sounds like an elevator. No idea what it is. This unit had no kitchen towels and we were given one hand towel and washcloth. Parking was sketchy and most nights we got the last spot around 9:00pm. The building needs serious maintenance and updating. Thank goodness the beds were comfortable and clean. I find it hard to believe this unit was \u201crenovated\u201d in 2020.

I put my trust into this company to insure my rental property would be properly managed, besides rent being collected every month. Per the signed agreement, the tenant was responsible for caring for the rental property, such as changing the air filter every 30 days, replacing light bulbs, cleaning the home thoroughly and trash removal upon departure, and notifying (within 7 days) the property management of any damages and/or problems to anything inside or outside of the home. None of these actions were completed by the tenant upon DRES releasing the security deposit.\nI gave the tenant a 30-day notice, August 10-September 10, to vacate the property (also stated in the agreement that there is a 30 day notice unless stated otherwise). I planned for my family and I to move into my home September 11, but they failed to inform me the tenant was not able to relocate until September 13. I had to write to them days before my family and I were going to move in to find out this information.\nI trusted in Dothan Real Estate Services to properly inspect my home after the tenant\u2019s departure. This was not done properly, and the security deposit was released within one week of the tenant\u2019s departure, before I could make an itemized inspection of my own (which is written in the signed agreement). Per the Alabama Code Title 35. Property \u00a7 35-9A-201 \u201cUpon termination of the tenancy, money held by the landlord as security may be applied to the payment of accrued rent and the amount of damages that the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenant's noncompliance with Section 35-9A-301 all as itemized by the landlord in a written notice delivered to the tenant together with the amount due 60 days after termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession.\u201d\nOnce I moved back into my home (5 days after the tenant) there were numerous things that were wrong. The things that were missed by the inspections were: the microwave no longer works, light bulbs in both bathrooms were blown, the sink in the half bath is leaking, air filter was never changed (or at least not for months) which caused my HVAC system to freeze,  the home was very dirty with dust and debris everywhere, garbage and furniture left out by the street, and there was an unauthorized pet that left urine and feces (which I have pictures) in the hall closet. I immediately notified DRES, looking for a solution, and to my surprise they were not willing to help. They even agreed to the wrongful actions, but still would not offer a solution.   I must replace these things and pull up my floors in the hall closet due to the damage of the pet. I only asked for help with the $200 deposit for the unauthorized pet, but they were not willing to help. They violated their own rental agreement by falsifying all the things this company was willing to do.\nThey still have yet to give me a copy of what they did take out of the security deposit and how much the tenant received. I will no longer consider Dothan Real Estate Services for future rentals nor will I give any recommendations to anyone. As an owner, my first home/rental experience was terrible due to the lack of ethics from this business.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2wG87aaFeBJbG5g7j0YEh7sxzzXUNeDUWL7eZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6b2u6HIJy_fs58F23XsNY_LwUOJ-ifHnPyizC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892924263a9a229:0x3d0a8ef3608105c"}

She gave me some spill about the 3 capacities in which she works and recommended getting comps first. No offer was made on my part after the viewing. I text her on Sunday and didn\u2019t receive a response and called her on Monday and didn\u2019t get a response. It wasn\u2019t until I escalated and requested a new realtor that she finally called me back, 3 days later,  with bad news that someone had made an offer after my viewing that was accepted.\n\nThis is her response after 3 days of no communication and me escalating my disappointment. October 23rd, 2020 @ 12:23 in the afternoon. \u201cI just called the listing agent to make sure it was still available. She said it was shown Friday and a offer was made and accepted after we looked.\nThe buyer is pre approved as well. She has another one on the same street at 2301 1st Ave N unit 209. MLS 884030.\nShe said you are welcome to make a back-up offer in case something happens to that buyer.\nIt is crazy. A resident can sit for days then have multiple offers.\nI hate it for you.\nDo you want to look at this one?\u201d\n\nI had preapproval that she knew about and I stated upon viewing the listing that I LOVED it. The dissengenuine statement she made of \u201cI hate it for you\u201d is an unacceptable attempt at empathizing after her major laps in professionalism.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604080814157, "text": "We apologize that our agents service did not meet your expectations.

Honestly, you never feel like a client, you feel like family going through the home buying/ selling process together.\nMy first encounter with Kelly was approximately 8 years ago. We were in the process of moving, and we needed a place to rent. I got in contact with Kelly, and she happened to know of a gentleman who was getting ready to rent out his place. I told her, that I would use her for a realtor when we started looking into buying a home. Months later, my husband and I became pregnant and we were ready to buy our first home, so of course, we contacted Kelly. She is so knowledgeable and easy to work with. She helped us in anyway possible. We stayed in close contact through the whole process. She made our first home buying experience less stressful and guided us along the process every step of the way. 6 years after that, we we decided to move back home, close to family. Without any question, we called Kelly again. She came in and did a walk through to get us ready to sale our home. The process was so quick and easy and she guided us though the process and everything ran smoothly. Selling our home was a very emotional, sad time for us. We brought our babies home to that house, so it was very hard, but Kelly was very positive and encouraging during it all. When looking for our knew home, we contacted each other and she was checking in on us to see how it was going. I just mentioned how I wasn't as crazy about our new realtor. Kelly offered to travel over an hour away, to a different county, to come and help us find a home. Now that dedication and shows what a true, honest, caring realtor is all about.

I've have tried calling their sales office, I was told to call corporate, I called corporate and got voicemail.\n\nMy house is about 4 years old.  Well out of warranty.  But, most of the poor workmanship appears after the warranty period has ended.  My master bath and entrance to our master bedroom has severe structural problems.  The cracks you see have been re-plastered and painted more than once.  Forget about doors closing properly.  The doors have been trimmed to such an extent that a new door will be required for the bedroom.  The framing issues you may have will not be covered by your warranty and will not appear until a few years after you own your home.  Once they do, you will find yourself spending a lot of money to repair.\n\nIf framing were the only issue, I probably would not write the review.  I never do this kind of thing.  But the electrical was done so poorly that it nearly burned the house down.  The left exposes copper to aluminum high voltage line exposed in a junction box.  The result was blowing out the double oven's control panel.  This resulted in an expensive repair to the ovens, but could have easily resulted in a fire.   Again-- the kind of thing that happens well after your warranty period has expired.\n\nThe problem I have with Woodland, is that their \"quality\" is only skin deep.  They have a great marketing staff, but once your in your house and a year has passed you are on your own to deal with the poor workmanship that lies just below the surface.  No builder is perfect.  But, it would be nice if they built to code.

The sub-contractors don\u2019t keep up with their warranty repairs and Woodland doesn\u2019t follow-up with you after closing unless you are constantly in contact with them. Check my review of Custom Interior Trim to see just how their subs act and treat customers.\n\nTheir warranty team is an absolute joke. They don\u2019t follow-up, they don\u2019t coordinate, and if you aren\u2019t keeping them in line, they just let your items slide off the radar.\n\nThey have shown a complete lack of professionalism ever since we closed. I will admit, we love the house itself. It\u2019s good quality, the design process was fun, and we felt like the options they had to choose from were exactly in line with what we wanted, but the worst mistake I ever made was trusting that they would continue their great service after having closed on the house. If you don\u2019t listen to anything else, just hear me when I say do NOT let them close on your house until they finish everything. It has truly been bad enough that I regret ever choosing them as a builder, no matter how much we do like the house itself.\n\nAnd again, if I\u2019m being completely honest, the staff that they have are nice people. I mean I have legitimately enjoyed dealing with most of their staff, but I\u2019ve also had to do their job for them. I have to do all of the follow-up to make sure people are showing up to do their warranty repairs. I\u2019ve had to coordinate with the warranty department and the subs to make sure they had all of the correction items listed.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting dealing with Woodland and their lack of support for Warranty customers. I\u2019ve told them this multiple times, but if they would put just as much care into how they treat and deal with Warranty customers as they do with new customers still in the building process, they would be a nearly flawless business. Until then, they deserve this negative review and more. I\u2019ve spoken with multiple people in my neighborhood who can corroborate this story and would say the same thing themselves. We have warned people we know away from Woodland specifically because of this and away from some of the specific sub contractors they use. Horrible customer service, dismal professionalism, and a demeanor that says \u201cyou as a customer don\u2019t matter to us as much as the new build customers.\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617991364735, "text": "Blake,\n\nThank you for the kind words regarding your home building experience with Woodland Homes. We are happy to hear that you had a fun experience and enjoyed our process of building. Next, we would like to say that we understand your frustrations with warranty. We are in fact struggling with time lines and subcontractors. At this time North Alabama and surrounding areas are experiencing a housing boom. This combined with the struggles of building a product in the midst\u2019s of a global pandemic have made it difficult to obtain products for some of our customers warranty requests.\n\nIt is also difficult to keep subs motivated when they have so much work to choose from in front of them. This is just the honest truth, and the reality of the world we are living in.  That said we understand it is frustrating to wait on your items to be completed. While it may take us a little longer to complete a warranty item we are getting to all of our customers and completing their warranty requests. In fact, we have even extended specific warrantable items past the agreed upon 1 year term in order to ensure our customers are happy, and have their items completed .\n\nSince we don\u2019t know your full name there is no way to reach out directly. We would encourage you to call your onsite sales person and get them involved to assist you, or even call our corporate office and ask for the president of the company. He will be happy to work directly with you."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626897a1fd8d25:0x85114f992ebfd966"}

The personnel in the home office were welcoming and professional. During the build I hired a home inspector who found major errors with the home. This information was relayed to the site manager and many of the errors were overlooked and I\u2019m still dealing with them. Upon walking through my home I found basic issues with the craftsmanship that should\u2019ve been addressed by the site manager, if he had completed a walk thru of the home. Once the home was complete a final walk thru was scheduled. I found the same issues as the last walk thru. At this point, if you don\u2019t address the problem it\u2019s often overlooked. I refused to sign for the keys. As a buyer I felt rushed to sign for the keys to the home, that wasn\u2019t ready. I was promised the issues would be addressed in a timely manner, \u201cI\u2019M STILL WAITING\u201d. I still have a page of outstanding issues with my home. As a premier builder I expected more. The subcontractors provided poor quality of work. No disrespect, but the attention to detail lacked, for my home. I hope no one has to go through what I did. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s due to the number of homes Woodland is trying to build or is this the standard issue with Woodland across the board. I didn\u2019t want to come off as a complainer, so I asked around my neighborhood and many of us shared the same problems. This is not to bash Woodland. The homes, cosmetically looks great, I think more effort needs to be made to build a better quality home for the price and oversight of the subcontractors is a must. If this doesn\u2019t happen hold the site manager accountable. The warranty department shouldn\u2019t make people feel like they are the problem. The subcontractors need to do their job and provide a quality product. If I had to do it all again I would definitely ask around the neighborhood where I\u2019m buying and meet one on one with the builder.

It actually defies logic that I could desire so much to live there, be impressed with what I saw, and have the experiences I have had. Maybe it is coincidence but I don\u2019t think so. I will simply state what happened and let the reader decide. I have seriously looked at Woodland homes 4 times. The first experience was positive but I was afraid of the road in and out of the area so I decided not to buy. The last 3 times I had resolved that fear and wanted to purchase a house from Woodland homes. The first of these three, I spoke with an associate. He showed me a lot and gave me a price for a home on the lot. He said we had to see his boss. I did so and she literally panicked. She said he gave me the wrong price. I said ok and left. The second of these 3 times, Woodland homes sent me an email with an advertisement for a house already built. It was priced in the range we were looking for. We made an appointment with the aforementioned realtor and spent 30 minutes looking at the home. It had one feature we did not like but we were about to make an offer when she said oh no, this house has been sold. She added, but we can build you one like it on another lot. We spent a couple of hours looking at lots and found 3 we liked. She said she would send us the prices on all three. The result was that the lot we wanted was not available for the house we wanted to build on it and the other two had prices that were 40 to 50 thousand dollars more than the one we looked at. Not exactly the same price...The last time my wife met with a different realtor and got prices for several models one of which was built and the other almost completed. You have probably guessed what happened. I showed up with the checkbook only to find that all of the homes with quoted prices were much higher than documented on the plans provided to my wife. The one we really wanted was about $70,000 more. The other home already built was about 40,000 dollars more than documented on the plans.We left and will not return. The neighborhood looks great and maybe our experience is some kind of odd anomaly. Just wanted to share it.

However, if you are looking for top quality and attention to detail, you would be better off with another builder. They build homes quickly - maybe too quickly as evidenced by some of the problems we have experienced.  After living in our home for two years, a light switch in our dining room which was not in use at the time suddenly sparked and popped and caused a breaker to blow.  I called an electrician who discovered that the wiring was barely connected which caused arcing and sparking.  He then checked a few more light switches and outlets to find that about half of them were loose and sloppily constructed.  I ended up paying for the electrician to inspect every light switch and electrical plug in my home. I have also had to replace wiring in the electrical box because of a humming noise.\nWhen you build a home with Woodland, they schedule you for a one day marathon of dealing with the contract staff and their design team.  You must be prepared to make ALL decisions in one day.  Their design center has a limited number of choices and you have no time to research products. Don't assume that they offer quality products, either.  Price Pfister products were their plumbing choice at the time I built my home. Huge mistake.  If I had known how crappy this brand was, I would have insisted on Delta products. That goes for wood floors also.  I chose a \"premium\" product for an additional cost only to find after it started denting and scratching immediately that it was made out of a soft eucalyptus based engineered wood.  I have already replaced half of it with a nice Hickory engineered wood that has held up beautifully- even in high traffic.\nI was not happy with either their ceramic tile selection or carpet choices but had no option other than to pick what I disliked the least.  Apparently, most of my neighbors did the same because we all have the same back splash.  I have already replaced carpeting in my bedroom because of poor wear.\nThis is not the first home that I have had built so it is not like I was expecting perfection.

Before renting through independence ask yourself \u201cdo I really want to rent from a company who would evict a 5 month pregnant women with asthma during the middle of a pandemic in which a no eviction bill was just passed?\u201d Got a letter at the end of February in the mail stating we were behind on rent (Clearly we were, they had locked us out of the online payment portal), wouldn\u2019t return any phone calls, hung up on my boyfriend the one time Ashley actually picked up the phone, and set the office to appointment only so you couldn\u2019t just walk in to handle matters. That was the only communication we had with them. Fast forward to March 18th when three Madison county sheriff deputies showed up with some crackhead with an attitude and three guys to set my stuff out. I never received an eviction notice and nothing was ever posted on our door. We had the money but were just unable to make the payment due to the poor professionalism exhibited by Robert and Ashley in returning communications. I have been told by many parties to seek legal help and that is exactly what I plan on doing. I was at work and my boyfriend was home when the sherif showed up. In the time it took him to pick me up from\nWork to rent a uhaul they already had most of my stuff in the yard, and my belongings had already been picked through by the people sent to move the stuff out. Included in the missing items were my gun safe, two lock boxes holding personal information like my sons birth certificate etc, and a box that contained my coach and Louie bags as well as a bridesmaid dress. All valued well over $2000 for the one box alone. It is worth mentioning after such horrendous treatment considering my condition and willingness to pay that Ashley clardy is the wife of billy clardy the officer who recently lost his life on the job. While she is accepting handouts left and right and having her house paid off what she has failed to mention to the community is that she was cheating on her husband with Chris from her plumbing contractor sludgebusters. Before you scream slander it does not apply to factual statements that can proven in a court of law or with the use of lie detector tests. My boyfriend worked directly along side with Chris at sludgebusters and that\u2019s how we got the apt in the first place plus the first hand knowledge of her trashy misdoings. If you absolutely are homeless and desperately need a place to stay I would say try public housing before ever considering renting from independence realty. I am contacting legal guidance regarding the no notice posted, no eviction ban during a national emergency for a high risk mother to be, and for the goods stolen from my property. In 18 years of renting I have NEVER rented from such a poorly run company. I will never recommend this company and if I could give them less than 1 Star I would.

My very first maintenance request with them was immediately a bad experience. They CHARGED me for the plumbing maintenance, in which this house has had many plumbing issues for YEARS and needed a new toilet- per the plumber. After MONTHS of going back and forth and refusing to pay this charge I had to send a VIDEO to the manager/owner, Robert Taylor, of how there was no pressure in the flush of the toilet. It was replaced. There has been NO up keep of the property other than what I have done myself (carpet cleaning, yard work, pest control, etc). There is a LARGE FALLING tree in the back yard that with time has started to lean more and more. Even my neighbor has called the company concerned about it. After over 9 months of discussing this tree I was promised it would be removed in December 2015... Well, here we are in June 2016 and it is still there. Limbs (8\" round) are constantly falling, ruining any back yard furniture I have. Has even damaged my brand new grill. The carpet and walls have mildew from MULTIPLE leaks coming under the walls and into the hallways. All of which I called SEVERAL times about. This last time it took over a week to get anyone out for the carpet, in which I had to demand several times. The carpet people sucked and didn't want to pull the carpet up to dry it underneath (the leak was coming from under the wall so underneath the carpet and padding), then when they did, the didn't tack the carpet back down properly and now there is a huge gap between the carpet in the hallway.Every since then the house has a really old, dirty, mildew smell to it. This carpet is over 10+ years old and is rental grade carpet. It is literally falling apart from NORMAL wear and tear, I have told them several times that it is in awful condition. I have had several random \"late\" charges added to my account multiple times, in which I have to question and raise hell to have removed... rent paid on time. I am FINALLY moving. I turned in a 30 day notice a couple of weeks ago stating I would move at the end of June. Today, June 3rd, I receive a text about turning in my keys. I call them and am told that the owners (whom I've never met in my life) were under the impression I was moving May 30th... WRONG. The move out date is in writing, and recorded in email.

I left a 5 star.  At this time I must retract that review.  It's been a year now, my family, the company that surveyed the land and a few others are now in a law suit and land dispute. Susan Stratton will also be changing her review to reflect the incompetence of this company. Who the hell sells land and has no idea what they are actually selling.  Or who actually owns it! These guys are amateurs and can not be trusted with your hard earned money.

The closing attorney reviewed the survey and did not find an issue. We are not a title company or a surveyor so we can\u2019t establish land lines or grant title to a property.

Most of the office staff is polite, the maintenance workers do a satisfactory job, and maintenance issues are usually addressed in a day or two.\n\nHowever, a few incidences led to the 1-star review. First, when I moved into one of the apartments I was given the key but no parking tag. When I asked about the parking tag, they responded with, \"we just ordered them so you will receive them later this month when they come in.\" Not having parking passes ready to go for the start of fall classes is a demonstration of their incompetence. Classes start approximately the same time every year, and most Auburn leases start in August. Anyone with an ounce of common sense would understand that enough parking passes need to be ready at the start of August to accommodate every tenant. Instead, since my lot was one of the closer ones to campus, I had to park at other places than the complex I was paying for because non-residents realized that parking tags had not yet been sent out. Secondly, if you are graduating in December, or looking for someone to take over your lease for the summer months, be prepared to feel mugged when they assess all of the fees. One of the fees stated that it was because Northcutt would help in finding someone to take over the lease. I found someone myself, and they still would not come off or even down on the steep fee. They stated another one of the fees was for cleaning and basic preparation for the incoming lessee. However, I can tell you that no cleaning was done. So again, they're taking fees, but not giving you what you pay for. When I talked to Van Northcutt about coming down on the fees, he threatened to not approve the re-lease and cause me to be stuck paying for rent in a place I wasn't living--what an unethical guy. Finally, when I did move out I had to wait upwards of 2 and a half months in order to receive my security deposit back after being assured several times that it would be sent in the mail \"soon.\"\n\nIn summary, if you will be in the apartment for the full 12-month lease, you might not have too many problems. However, if you're not going to be there for the whole twelve months, do not lease here unless you are prepared for several \"headaches.\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf302c8ff6fd9:0xa2092566e6a7997f"}

Then as I'm finally leaving, the guy who checked me out tells me to just leave my modem and router for the next tenant, so I did. When Charter can't get into the room to get the modem, Northcutt tells me they sold the property, and they had no record of who cleaned my room or who they sold it to, and that they refused to pay for the now lost equipment (costing me $150) because Mr. Northcutt \"didn't know\" what I was told but it wasn't his problem.

I attributed it to the fact that the area was dimly lit. I addressed the concern to management and suggested adding a flood light on the first incident, and nothing was done. On the second incident I again went to \"king\" Northcutt and he insinuated that it MUST be because I have enemies. First off, I don't. Second off, two separate cars were involved in each incident (my wife's car and my car).\n\nSecond problem: I was towed twice from my apartment because my parking pass was stolen, and King Northcutt refused to back me. I was forced to pay the $100 tow fee twice.\n\nFinal incident: I graduated from Auburn University and received my commission into the United States Navy on December 12, 2011. I didn't receive my orders until December 5, 2011 and on that day I went to Northcutt Realty to terminate my lease under the Servicemember's Civil Relief Act, wherein it states that upon receipt of orders, the realty company can only hold you accountable for rent 30 days from the time. Since I didn't receive my orders until the 5th, they told me I was accountable for January's rent too. I told the secretary that I would be paying two rents (one in Norfolk, VA and the one at Northcutt) if they didn't waive the fee. I argued that there was no way to get my orders in any earlier, and that I notified them as soon as I got them. She said I would have to talk to King Northcutt to see if he would waive the fee. I did, and he said, \"well I'm already relieving you of your obligation from the rest of your lease.\" Correction: YOU AREN'T DOING ANYTHING. YOU ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO DO THAT. I think this speaks to the nature of the management there. Any respectable person would've waived January's fee, and just acknowledged the sacrifices military members make. For instance: my wife just left on deployment, I'll leave in a few months, so I won't see her again for a year. Cost of incident: Any last respect I had for these yahoos. I'll step down of my soap box now. The apartment itself was nice and comfortable, but these major incidents absolutely did it for me. The major problem about this company is that they're everywhere, and from what it seems each realty company is as bad as the next.

Sad!\nWhile this is not a terrible or unsafe place to live, it's that borderline between upper lower class and lower working class. As a consequence, there is a wide array of persons\nthat end up living here. Though you have some\nvery respectful neighbors, unfortunately you\nalso run the risk of having absolute jerks as\nneighbors. While one can make the argument\nthat any apartment complex is going to have that\nissue, it does seem to be a bigger issue here since\nthere is that wide discrepancy in socio-economic\nincome here. I will break this review down into\nthree categories: Price, amenities, and overall\nexperience.\nPrice: Not everybody pays the same amount. I'm\nnot talking about the different levels of pay for\nwhichever floor. For instance, you're going to pay\na higher price on the bottom floor while paying a\nlesser price on the third floor. What I am referring\nto is the cost of an apartment vs. What's your\nneighbor might be paying. In one case, a neighbor\nwas paying around $60 less per month than I was.\nThis was based off the fact that when they signed\ntheir lease the rent was lower. Unfortunately, what\nthat means is that when your lease runs out, you\nautomatically get moved to month to month. But\nunless you ask, you're not going to know whether\nor not the rent has fluctuated up or down. It's nice\nto go month-to-month after a year lease is up but it\nwould also be nice to know what the current going\nrate for the rent is so if I wanted to re-sign a lease\nfor a lower rate I could. The reason I won't mention\nrent amount though is that I don't know what\nthe current going rate is and I don't want to give\nincorrect information.\nAmenities: they don't have much. There is no other\nway to put. The workout room is nearly unusable\nbecause it's so small, it does have a fairly nice pool\nunfortunately it is not as clean as it should be. I have\nfound everything from cigarette butts to pieces of\nbroken glass in and around the pool. I can't blame\nthe apartment complex property manager for this,\nsince they are not the ones who did it, but I feel like\nit should be cleaned on a more regular basis. There\nis a playground on the property but it's basically\nfalling apart and the feral cats that live in the area\nuse the sand as their litter box so it's pretty gross.\nOn the plus side, you do have free internet and\ncable and you don't have to pay for water. While\nthe Internet isn't super fast, it's pretty darn good\nfor something you're not paying for. Not always\nsuper reliable but you can stream on it without too\nmuch of an issue as long as you're not trying to\nwatch HD video. There are three dumpsters on site\nbut unfortunately a lot of trash blows around the\napartment complex because people have trouble\nthrowing their trash into the dumpsters. I want saw\nan old man on his scooter picking up trash because\nhe couldn't take it anymore. It's a problem that got\nworse the longer I lived there. Maintenance is also\na small problem. This apartment complex is well\nover 10 years old now and is starting to show the\nsigns and problems that an older complex going to\nhave. Unfortunately, the owners of this apartment\ncomplex won't hire more maintenance workers so\nthe one guy they have on staff is WAY overworked!\nGreat guy and very helpful, but I wouldn't want his\njob because he has way too much on his plate\nOverall experience: Would I recommend this\napartment complex to someone? That's a hard\nquestion to answer. If you can afford to spend\ncloser to the $1,000 mark, I would suggest\nfinding a different apartment complex. They are\nunderstaffed (don't get me started about whether\nor not they'll be someone in the office on any given\nday) and it's not the cleanest", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe3PgThOrKrkHdY9IUms99_nJtGHutBSp9CLyj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeqj0Q6Nsp_nWmHCqsK6N1cDyoVnP9ValCtNDC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaSX3o39YLWkDQeYJIJsduBXLBw577e9e2Kx72=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMc_uNoAKawOnfVB-pIMj-jOvPb669kcmQqmkSm=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3nW5ZYzzxR504FZk0LhI9aVP6RUzSOnqaQAJE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpdwWE-ykrGwx1SbTUcpt3cXrO0irnM9kWzlhT=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVhDS5Bkuz13bK0cib5eorGFT_SGZOggju55S5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2tN7dlu-JIES8AsKZZKyiWqqnOqLxKU_e9TKu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBa2UjbnoAWfpdMsGqJHYU48sJoVMb3TwSXYC8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy3ffATm46ahg5iG0gQMxrsOPlApQJ6xXpt6FG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnCkU_h43bL6L0Fdb4Fv7khsOIV8GUroJvao0h=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFhUH_p8GxxwVixkze6n3r8WOKEmrYRhRjf2lE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvQ7fXeBarxpqWWtpnXj82djHwHl9tEmgs0VPA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7v9b6xdgmk5DDGBzy4zy39wrTltQW4oJDUEK5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxK7RczzmMYWs3LIz8r4zYipvfp1laik-lvt1p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt81JjW59vKdPQyS9aB1zuTe3ODd_KnO25hmIW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0d111xLh1IQ3XYcL_ECP-7U7wcdFTtsR4dsv6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1597152143360, "text": "Thank you for your review!

When we found out we were moving to this area, my husband and I spent at least 5-6 months searching and over-analyzing every apartment complex between Phenix City, AL and Columbus, GA. During that time I found myself constantly disappointed with the results I was getting. Apartments were either grossly overpriced, extremely particular about the potential ferociousness of our lovable Boxer puppy, or too good to be true. The apartments we thought were perfect ended up being full of problems (which we discovered through reviews like this), so I had no other option but to try and accept the fact that we were going to have to settle for two years of car break-ins, obnoxious neighbors, and bugs infestations.\n\nThat was until I stumbled upon Windsweep Luxury Apartments. You WILL NOT find this level of quality for such an affordable price. We have lived here for several months now, and for once in my life I have ZERO complaints (can't you tell I'm quite the ray of sunshine?). The manager, Erica, is phenomenal at what she does. I have worked in customer service for years (including management) and I can tell you from a professional standpoint that she is someone that any business would be lucky to have. Nowhere else will you find a property manager that remembers each of their tenants' names, and genuinely cares for the people around them.\n\nThe apartments are beautiful, the maintenance workers are great, incredibly prompt, and polite, the neighborhood is quiet, and the overall atmosphere is just great. I could go on and on about Windsweep.\n\nDo yourself a favor and check this place out.

She helped my husband & me find our DREAM LAKE HOME!  This has been  a dream for over 10 years and in less than 6 months we found it and closed on our Family home where we will make many wonderful memories with our kids and grandkids.  Heather Myers was the key!\n\nWe live in Middle TN and wanted to find something within less than a 3 hour drive from home so that reaching the lake house after work on Friday afternoons would be an easy drive.  We narrowed down several areas in TN, KY and AL based on our desires and budget. Then we met with realtors in those areas and this is where Heather comes into our story.  She was a JOY to work with from the very first day and she was the link we needed.  Any questions we had, she answered quickly and efficiently.  She educated us about the areas around Weiss Lake and discussed budgetary factors.  She found us homes to consider in the lower range that might need a bit of work but had true potential with a little sweat equity.  She found us homes on the high side that were great comparisons to what those with potential could become and she worked and worked to find us the RIGHT HOME.\n\nWe finally made some specific realizations that minimum steps, great water view, dock with boat lift, private ramp and open entertaining were our focus.  3 BR and 2 BA was the plan to accommodate our family.  Then she worked her magic.\n\nWe found one of those \u201cpotential\u201d homes and even though it had lots of steps, it had everything else and we put in a contract.  However due to the home inspection discoveries we had to walk away and I was devastated.  I could see our family putting our touch on the home to make it ours.  But, she gave us good advice and helped us to walk away and KNOW that the right house would be out there at the right time, right place and right price.  We just needed a little more time.\n\nAnd then it happened, a house hit the market, we set up an appointment to see it the first opportunity we could and after leaving we knew we had found what we were searching for.  When I walked in my husband saw my face and he knew that I was HOME!  We were on contract within 2 hours and never looked back.  Her advice was paramount to us understanding that homes like this rarely came on the market and we needed to act fast.\n\nIt took perseverance, good instincts and a bit of a BULLDOG attitude to get us here and she has all of these and is willing to put them to work for you.\n\nPlease don\u2019t miss the opportunity to let Heather Meyers with Sweet Home Alabama Real Estate help you find your Dream Home.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570125148151, "text": "I enjoyed working with you and George so much!
