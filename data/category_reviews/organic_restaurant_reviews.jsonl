I asked to speak to the man I normally spoke to and that he was the manager and I couldn\u2019t remember his name.I was informed he was fired and I was talking to one of the managers who took his place. She was maybe 15-17 which makes no sense to me. She had no clue what she was talking about with regards to their menu and did not really help me at all and seemed angry that I was asking so many questions.

I\u2019m in 50s and trying so hard to stay healthy and keep my mask on in public. Where I live in AL, today we had the highest COVID spike on record. None of your three servers had masks and looked oblivious to my question (polite) why they didn\u2019t. We are in the middle of a pandemic. I stated this concern on their ig and they blocked me. As they say below, posting on their ig concerns is not in their opinion acceptable. As any business knows,  social media is where people can comment positive or negative concerns. If companies delete anything that is not glowing it shows a refusal to truly address customer concerns. Why not publicly state your official policies. Any successful co will allow feedback \u2014good or bad\u2014 so long as it\u2019s not vulgar.  This refusal to care about customers health,  and then to not reply reasonably to feedback is not acceptable. There is no admission in your reply to me that there is any policy re this public health matter. Im appalled as a franchise that you allow this and I\u2019m quite upset. I was a regular but no more. It appears that teenagers unmasked are calling the shots. If you are in the food industry in AL and watching the news you need to realize that this is unsafe.These unmasked kids have parents and grandparents and can be asymptomatic and pass it on to them, others and your customers. The employee stated \u201cwe don\u2019t have to wear them.\u201d  You are now saying they do?? It\u2019s not clear. Did you change your policies yesterday? Was the employee making that up?
