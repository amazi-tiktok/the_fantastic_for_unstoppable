No. Because it's run by flawed human beings...who are doing their best to follow God's will that we love and serve one another.

No, because EVERYBODY wants something for nothing...so they have to determine (to the best of their ability) how to help.

However, I received a phone call a couple days before hand (they left a voicemail) that I would not be receiving internet services.\n\nI called at 11:44am and was placed on hold for quite some time and could not stay on the phone for any longer as my lunch break was over.\nI called again at 4:14pm. This call lasted 11 minutes. I was told that I could not get high speed but that I could get 12mb.\n\nSeptember 15th\nI called Frontier again and I was told I could only get 6mb, then the statement was retracted, and I was told that I could not get any internet service at my location. I questioned this as I had been previously told that I could get 6mb, then I was told once again that I actually could get 6mb. So then I scheduled an appointment for 10/6/2020 to have the internet installed.\n\nOctober 6th\nFrontier was scheduled to come between 1pm-5pm. I had to work, so I had a friend come over to my house on their day off so someone could be there. Frontier came at 9:30am and left a note on the door that they needed to bury a drop box. I called frontier at 11:31am wondering why someone had arrived so early. I was on the phone until 11:47am during my lunch at work trying to get this figured out, but did not receive any answers. I was not very happy, as I assumed I would be receiving internet services this day. I would think that Frontier would know if I had a drop box at my house already? Frontier left me a voicemail that someone would be coming to run the lines for my internet on October 20th, and I would get internet installed on October 26th.\n\nOctober 26th\nI received a text reminder on October 25th to remind me of my upcoming appointment with Frontier. I also received another text message reminder on October 26th that Frontier would be coming to my house between 1pm-5pm. Once again, I had someone at my house as I usually work during these hours. Frontier never came... I called Frontier at 4:57pm wondering what was going on. Once again, I didn't really receive an answer. I was told that the department that I needed to talk to was already gone for the day and that they would give me a call the next day.\n\nOctober 27th\nI called Frontier again.. and explained that I have never had so many problems with a company before. I explained that I have been trying to get internet from them for almost 2 months now.. and I have had nothing but problems. They told me that a subcontractor needs to come out and run the lines before they can install internet... they also explained that they should be contacting me soon.. which I obviously didn't believe at this point. I told them I was very dissatisfied and that I would be going with a different internet company at this point.\n\nOctober 30th\nI went with a different company and have internet and am currently using it with no problems :)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889079b02d467b29:0xe53f14dd904bac61"}

First, I want to say, the technicians hands are tied as far what they can do. they are doing the best they can to put band aids on these old lines and keep them running. But still to this day, I have quite a few internet disconnects a day. I have just given up on them ever fixing the problem and should mention that this happens every year sometimes more than once were my internet will just stop working and they fix it And then it works fine for a few weeks then it goes back to frequent disconnects and so on. the technicians have measured as many as 400 disconnects in a 24 hr period. If they would just upgrade these lines and may run some fiber optic to some of the main hubs then these problems would stop. I wish I could say I'm the only one with these problem.s but my neighbors all say the same thing. I was told these lines were originally only run to be used for phone. But my parents live next door and they always  have issues with both internet and phone. they have lots of really loud staic in the lines and sometime buzzing so loud you can't hear anything and often times the phone just doesn't work. so even if these lines in our area were supposed to be used primarily for landline phones, obviously they aren't sufficient for that either. so why not replace them with new lines and have satisfied customers instead of reviews and complaints like this? because they don't care about those of us who are getting terrible service. they have no competition here to worry about so they know they can ignore us and continue to collect our money. the moment another company moves in, a lot of us in this area will be switching.

Not long ago, the council (I know a few) had the tribe audited. Guess what? Found non-Tsalagis on the rolls, getting per capita checks and everything. PLUS, they found via DNA, that some WEREN'T NATIVE AT ALL. So, remember, when you point a finger at someone, there are three fingers pointing back at you. Yes, I am enrolled. Had to prove my stuff too. Only AKC registered animals and Natives have to PROVE lineage. Actually, roll numbers, CDIBs are an insult. This \"fake indian\" has relatives that were enrolled and many not. I spend time with the EBCI and another tribe my father descended from. But this is a review about the Echota. Again, fine people. If anyone is lying about their heritage, then it WILL catch up to that person some day. But please don't let one rotten potato destroy the whole bag. Would you like me to introduce you to some \"REAL CHEROKEES\" who live in Murphy or Bryson City, NC who DON'T QUALIFY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE EASTERN BAND? Many are much more than the required 1/16. Its about casinos, money, etc. today, not the one drop rule of Cherokee citizenship that used to be. When I published a Cherokee book, dedicated to my Grandpa Lambert (in the EBCI library, across from the high school), people came out of the woodwork with the \"here's a fake medicine man trying to scam people out of money\". I don't even know what they were talking about, but getting a little sick. Who cares who has a roll number? BUT, who cares about money? Please note, folks who need help and cant get it because of the shysters, break my heart. I watched an elderly Cherokee woman beg the EBCI tribal council at a meeting, for help with her power bill in tears. She was rejected. I don't know why, but like I said, I DONT LIKE PEOPLE WHO PRETEND TO BE INDIAN FOR PROFIT MYSELF, but please be careful with folks like Echota whose ancestors may not be on the Dawes, Miller, Baker, Hester, Rez, rolls, etc. for whatever reason. And by the way, at one time, Cherokee family stories within the tribe WAS LAW. White men documented the Cherokee people until the Phoenix was published after Sequoya invented the syllabary. And even \"CHEROKEE\" is not a native word. It's of French origins. Tsalagi is the correct term, as is Ani-yunwiya, and Ani-Kituah (the principal people, and the people of God). Ask the elders about Bryson City, NC (Kituah) and it's significance.
