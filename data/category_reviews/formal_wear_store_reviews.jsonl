I would not recommend Promenade for any bridal services, especially bridesmaids dresses. I ordered dresses for my three bridesmaids about 5 months prior to my wedding. The manufacturer estimated a ship date about 6 weeks prior to my wedding. To make a long story short, the dresses never came in.\n\nFor more details, read below, but the bottom line is that I would take my business elsewhere in the future, and I recommend that others do the same. The consultants in the store were very nice and helpful, but it's not worth the headache of dealing with Promenade's lack of good communication skills. I guess they missed the lesson in business school that the customer is always right.\n\nWhen the dresses did not arrive in time for my wedding, they did offer us dresses from another source that were in stock. However, the sizes that my bridesmaids needed were not available. All three of my bridesmaids lived out of town, so having Promenade alter a larger dress down a size was not a feasible option for me, even though the store suggested altering dresses THEN shipping to the bridesmaids. I felt that anyone who knows anything would realize this option was crazy on a timeline of 10 days before the wedding. What were we going to do if the dresses were altered, shipped, and arrived 5 days before the wedding, and still didn't fit?\n\nSo about 10 days before my wedding, I ordered replacement dresses from David's Bridal and paid for overnight shipping. I'll admit that the fact that the original dresses never came in may have been the dress manufacturer's fault, but Promenade did not handle the situation well. The owner did not return phone calls when my mother or I would leave messages at the store, and she did not check the status of the supposed shipment as early or as often as I would have liked.\n\nI requested that the store reimburse me for the cost of the replacement dresses that the girls did not want or even like, but they refused. I sent an email to the owner with the invoices for these dresses, and never heard another word about it until I sent another email, waited 10 days, received no response, and then called the store to follow up.\n\nI don't want to sound like another jaded bride, but the truth is that there are plenty of other local businesses that do a better job of communicating with their customers and valuing customer satisfaction.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d45f35aef892b:0xb0bea7f33837c8f2"}

Today, surpassed all of my expectations. Today, Mrs. Pat just proved that going above and beyond for something you\u2019re passionate about and loving your customers is what makes businesses like hers successful. Jos A Banks is where John Michael ordered his custom tux for the wedding in early March. Due to the pandemic, their store closed and we were unable to pick it up upon its arrival to the store. Now, the store is closed until May 30th, even though the mall is open and the tuxedo is there; they\u2019re not willing to work with us in order to find a solution to get his custom tux to him, refund our money, or assist us along the way. Last night, after working 12 hours in the ER, around 9:00 pm, I sent a message to Mrs. Pat at Modern Brides. John Michael and I both were so upset. She responded within minutes, welcoming us into her store, and this morning, only 12 hours later: she had taken measurements, allowed him to try on a few tuxedo options, and had a new rental suit ordered that should be here in 1-2 days. Talk about a blessing! Mrs. Pat has been phenomenal! She\u2019s so excellent with customer service, but also just a sweet person. She has extended the offer to other brides, as well. She knows everyone, and everyone loves her because she\u2019s so precious. So, if you find yourself like me, stuck without options due to this crazy time - caterer, photographer, tuxedo rentals - anything to do with your wedding, please contact Mrs. Pat! You will not regret it. I cannot say enough about this sweet, angelic, Godly woman. A blessing to all of us in this area. <3", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591724696562, "text": "Kaitlin, thank you for your kind review. You and your sweet Hubby were a JOY to work with.

I was unable to make it back due to my work schedule, but they were incredibly unhelpful with trying to fix the problem and a pain to get in contact with.

Myself and another bridesmaid went in a few months before the wedding (as we were kindly prompted to do so); the wedding was at the end of October. The first week in October I was told the alterations had not begun as they had not received all the fittings yet (which they HAD!). I was also told I did not come in soon enough, I kindly reminded them I had been in at least two months prior. Later that day, another bridesmaid called and was told alterations were currently being performed and they would be done soon. Over a week later I called and was told my dress was finished, AND HAD BEEN FINISHED and they were waiting on me to come pick it up. However, no one at that store was gracious enough to give me a phone call letting me know the dress was ready. Other bridesmaids were told their dress was ready when it wasn't; or that their dress was not ready when it was. Alterations were also extremely overpriced for the experience that we had.. Not to mention they looked bad. Please, if you value your sanity, your money, and your relationships with the people in your wedding, DO NOT SHOP HERE, you're better off making your own dress.

We were told the nice zipper bags are only used for the short prom dresses.   I guess that they reward you for NOT spending a large amount of money at this boutique.  This sends the message that a prom dress is more important than a wedding dress.  My family member went to another bridal store and purchased a zippered garment bag for my daughter's wedding gown so the cheap bag we were given at Modern Bride wouldn't tear and possibly let dust or something worse damage the wedding gown.  By the way, the garment bag from the other bridal shop only cost us $10, so it can't be the cost of the garment bags that keeps Modern Brides from providing them to the brides purchasing their gown there, after all they do provide them for the much less expensive and short prom dresses they sell there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb731641629:0xecde2f90485b3aa8"}

BUT I would absolutely recommend you get your alterations done somewhere else. I was very unhappy after both fittings and was glad I had an aunt there to confirm it was not a good fit even though the owner/seamstress was trying to tell me it was. She was pinning for more alterations trying to assure me it would be better, but I didn't like it with it pinned and was terrified at my 3rd and final fitting I would still hate it. I was about to scrap the whole thing and get a completely different dress (crying over the thought of the cost) when my aunt took me to another tailor who immediately (just by pinning the dress differently) was able to get the dress to fit me MUCH better. Seeing the photos side by side made it apparent Modern Brides was not qualified to be altering wedding dresses (see below for yourself - Left photo Modern Brides pinning; Right photo other seamstress pinning). Unfortunately so much padding was already added by Modern Brides that the new seamstress/tailor could only do so much with the top so it was never a perfect fit and I fretted about it at my wedding and am still noticing the ill-fitting in the wedding photos. Modern Brides was professional about returning SOME of the money on the alterations (as another reviewer mentioned - every time I went in the store there was some new charge on my dress and despite paying it every time I was treated multiple times like I was delinquent) and offered a free cleaning of the dress still, but I needed to post to try to spare others from what I went through. Also, a friend had the same experience just before me and I should have listened and NOT let Modern Brides do my alterations.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKrJZh-qf3QHCmcUriTpRytlIjt2n1-B3NKhxh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZoyvVOVlVCrNyBdjDQLGo_cglIkDw03MOTqTJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb731641629:0xecde2f90485b3aa8"}

I looked everywhere in my area and she couldn't find what she was satisfied with so while reading reviews I noticed that Modern Brides had some good reviews and we decided to go there. The young ladies that showed us the prom dresses were very nice and my daughter got to try on several dresses. While picking out her dress, all workers were as nice and patient as they could possibly be. My daughter did have to have some alterations to her dress and the alterations were very expensive! We started out with a 20% discount off the dress, but every alteration had a price to it. She had to have the length taken off, three layers at $20 per layer! $60 dollars. $20 to take up one strap. Pat, the lady doing the alterations, said it would be done in a couple weeks. After 3 weeks, I had to call and the dress still wasn't finished. When we went to pick up the dress, 1 week later after calling again, the alterations were aweful! It was to short, the strap taken up was to tight, and the chest area was still to big. The front of the dress was crooked and the side without a strap turned under. When I brought all this to Pat's attention, she blamed it on the way the dress was made. Said all the beads on the dress was causing it to turn under. My daughter's prom dress the year before had the same amount, if not more, beads at the top and we didn't have this problem. She charged me $5 more dollars for doing a quick chest take up and when the dress still didn't fit right, she charged $30 more for leaving the dress again so she could take the chest area up right. She wouldn't even take off the $5 I had just paid her for the seam she had just took up! After another week of leaving the dress again, it still wasn't right. The front without a strap was lower than the side with the strap making the front look lopsided! We left with the dress and still had to go purchase body tape and breast push up inserts! Another $30! Be advised that I did read the reviews before purchasing the dress and until I purchased the dress everyone was great, but afterwards, the owner/seamstress was very rude and non-negotiable. Everything she does has a price! So beware before planning a wedding or prom dress affair with this company. You will be charged for their mistakes!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb731641629:0xecde2f90485b3aa8"}

My daughter has never been \"prom dress shopping\", so this was a special event for her. We drove 2+ hours to Elan, and we were greeted as we entered the store. Everything else from that point was terrible. My daughter tried on several gowns and the salesgirl held the train on each dress as I took a photo of my daughter in it - never one time did she ever ask us not to take photos of the gowns. After my daughter had tried on about 4-5 dresses, one of the other salesgirls commented \"we don't really like for y'all to take photos of the tags\", to which I said I was sorry and we stopped taking photos of the tags on the gowns. I was unsure why, but I assume it is because their gowns are marked up well over retail. After my daughter tried on 1-2 more gowns, an older lady walked over to us and very rudely yelled at my daughter if she was taking pictures she would have to delete all of them before leaving the store. She also said \"I know two of my girls have already told you to stop taking pictures\". This is untrue, as the only person who had previously said anything was the salesgirl (not ours) that said not to take photos of the tags. I could see my daughter was very visibly upset, so we said thank you and left the store. They lost my business forever, as well as everyone I know that I can tell about our experience. My daughter commented when we left that she never wants to go prom dress shopping ever again, so I am really upset that these incredibly rude girls have ruined this experience for my daughter.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1614050666769, "text": "This customer was not treated anything but wonderful in our store.
