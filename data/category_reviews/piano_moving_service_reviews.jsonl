Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission. Just be aware.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625061478074, "text": "Hello Mr. Phillis, We're very sorry to learn of your recent move experience.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter. You can reach me at the office @ 251-316-5977 or by email billy.stovall@twomen.com   While we never like to receive poor reviews, we will learn from it and hopefully improve our service to all customers. I appreciate you taking the time to leave it. Billy Stovall - Owner Two Men And A Truck Mobile, AL"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c5600ae3917:0x323715d12942ec3d"}

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

I went back and reviewed your paperwork and contact logs and I wanted to hopefully clear up some items for you. All of our trucks are 26 feet in length. While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter. You can reach me at the office @ 251-316-5977 or by email billy.stovall@twomen.com   While we never like to receive poor reviews, we will learn from it and hopefully improve our service to all customers.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

Prepare to be shocked when you receive a massive bill like  did for $700+ to move some items down the street.\n\nMy mother- in-law was moving less than a mile down the street. I had all of her stuff gift wrapped, packed, and ready to be moved. I even put all of it in the garage. No stairs, narrow hallways, or doors...easy right?\n\nThe problems start when they finally arrive 2.5 hours later than the given time. Which is annoying because she could have left work 45 min early instead of taking a vacation day to wait on them.\n\nThey finally arrive and begin work. Nearly 5-1/2 hours later they leave. I have no complaint about the work except that it could not all get done due the glacier pace they maintained at $115.00 per hour.\n\nI gave Crocker a call to work this out.

I waited until  10 and still no call.  When I finally got them to answer on Thursday, the lady was extremely rude.  She said that the truck broke down which is understandable.  She said that her guys called everyone, but I never received a call.  She then said that she would deliver it Saturday at 5.  My daughter has a recital at 7 and I am sure they will not be there at 5.  I ask if they could come any early and she said that there are 20 people ahead of me.  I am not happy.

They called us on a Friday to say our furniture could be delivered Monday.  In the voicemail, the company rep kept calling my husband Michelle, when his name is Michael. When she realized halfway through the message that she made a mistake, she said\u2019 \u201cI think it\u2019s supposed to be Michael and not Michelle...anyway...\u201d No apology or anything. When we called to reschedule because we were out of town, the same rep said she would call us back with a new time and day. She never did. We called three times before actually getting someone on the phone. Same rep informed us it would be delivered Tuesday at 12/ noon. Okay. Great. So, Tuesday at noon rolls around, and no one is here. We waited until 1:30 before calling to check the status, to which we got nothing but the voicemail multiple times. When my husband finally got someone on the phone, the same rep informed us that our furniture was scheduled for delivery on Wednesday, not Tuesday. Clearly my husband was upset since we rearranged our schedules and paid extra to keep my daughter in daycare. So, she says our furniture will be delivered Wednesday at 12. Because we had issues with times, I decided to call to make sure it was set for 12, and the same rep, very rudely, began arguing with me about what she said the day before and the times. I was trying to get an estimated time, and she kept interrupting me, and she finally hung up. At this time, I was livid with the situation and called back. Here\u2019s where the actual good part comes in. Said rep hands the phone to the company owner, who was extremely helpful. He listened without interrupting and sympathized with the situation. He informed me that delivery times are always approximately due to problems or delays with other scheduled deliveries and we would see our furniture between 12-4 on Wednesday. It was delivered before 12 the next day in great condition.\n\nThe reason why I am giving this company a 2 star instead of higher is solely bc of the rude and unprofessional receptionist.  She independently will run the company into the ground if she continues to act with other clients the way she did with us. I believe this company is a \u201cmom and pop\u201d family business, so I doubt she\u2019ll be going anywhere.

Now that I live in Foley AL, I called Two Men in a Truck's Foley location to set up a local move.  I went in to the office and spoke with the manager  Katelyn who told me I would only need one truck and two men, based on the fact that I have a one bedroom apartment.  She also told me that a week day is a much cheaper rate.  So I agreed and scheduled a day off work and set up my move for a Wednesday.  I paid the deposit of $125.00 which I was told would come off of my balance due after the move.  Within 10 minutes of leaving the office, I received a phone call from Crystal out of Mobile, AL.  She told me that there would be no way that two men could move me with one load in under 8 hours and to save time and money I need to increase to three men.  After my hesitation but her persistence and pressure, I agreed (bumping my hourly rate up to $165.00 from $125.00 I originally agreed to).  So Wednesday my move day came.  I received a phone call from the driver who said \"we are leaving the lot and we are 2 minutes away\"  which is absolutely true the lot is approximately 3 miles from my storage unit.  They arrived, loaded me up (the truck was barely half full) and went to my new residence which is a 5 mile drive and unloaded.  They were finished in less than 5 hours.  I completed the transaction on the tablet the driver had and paid my balance due.  Within 5 minutes of paying and the movers leaving I once AGAIN received a phone call from Crystal out of Mobile, AL who tells me that the GPS in the truck miscalculated the time and distance and I owe an additional $185.00.  My total bill for a 5 hour local move ended up costing me over $1,100.  RIDICULOUS  !\nI feel very ripped off by this company and by Crystal who twice contacted me to increase the amount of money I owe. I ended up paying for more than 5 hours plus the deposit (which got bumped up to $165) suddenly became travel costs and costs for the materials to wrap my furniture.  My receipt stated that the drivers came from Mobile, AL an hour's drive away.  Another rip off from this company.\nOnce I was in my apartment I realized that two pieces of my furniture were damaged.  Not one piece of my furniture was ever wrapped - even though I was charged for quilts and pads.  The young men that moved me were not professional in their moving abilities and how to take careful care of furniture and especially boxes marked fragile.\nSo after many many many phone calls I did have a headboard replaced, but my phone calls regarding my dining room table damages have been avoided.\nThis company is a poor reflection on Two Men and a Truck corporation.  This franchise is a money trap and so unprofessional.  It's a shame that the people in my area who have been displaced by a hurricane would be taken advantage of by a local moving company.  I will never use this location or franchise again and will make sure that I tell everyone I know in southern Baldwin County who need a mover to AVOID Two Men and a Truck Mobile, AL / Foley, AL", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625068008713, "text": "We are sorry that you had a bad experience.

Upon leaving my son\u2019s property, they ran into a newly installed security gate, about three weeks old, scraping it, jamming into the ground, damaging a post and the monitor, bending the metal on the gate, then left without a word. My son walked down to close the gate and discovered the damage. This company has said that they are not obligated to file insurance claims and felt they were not at fault AFTER the driver told them it happened!! After much talking, pleading this company sent my son a check for $500 for a $3200 gate. They finally agreed to hire a contracror to install, billing to be taken care of by Two Men and a Truck. The contractor worked for two days, demanded money from my son, left, never came back. NOW , the contractor says that the company will not pay him so he is threatening my son with a lien for $3200.  The contractor\u2019s work was not correct and workers are now correcting his work. My son did not hire this man. SO my question is, why does the contract that I signed state that damages caused by workers will be corrected at no cost to me as mistakes do happen??  Contractually, Two Men and a Truck have not honored  the contract that I signed in good faith. These people have accused my son of lying about the damage, yet proof was provided to them that this was a new gate. White paint scrapes were on the metal. This treatment to a customer is unacceptable, unethical. .", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0f2ab819cb8b:0xfd3c9131558daf74"}

I called 6-8 moving companies in Montgomery and they were the cheapest by a LANDSLIDE. That\u2019s first off. Secondly the owner Chris spoke to me on the phone and answered my questions but after that it was tricky to get him to return my calls or texts in the same day. But regardless, he was always polite and helpful. A bit\nOre communication on procedures and when to expect emails and confirmations and a deposit would have been helpful if dealing with a new clueless person like myself but it still was fine. Then the movers: first: they were so punctual they were too punctual by about 30 minutes! Lol. That was awesome. Secondly DEVON was amazing. As far as customer service... super friendly and nice and I needed that. I was super stressed. DEVON is a priceless employee from what I saw. 3: BOTH Devon and Alex were SUPER FAST! very very careful with my things also but so fast! This company and these guys are not trying to ride the clock and charge you any more than you neeed to pay. Bottom line, INTEGRITY. From Chris and the movers. Just integrity all around. Alex was quiet but a very very hard worker too. Do to end the review; I am a tough one when it comes to customer service and I could not be more impressed with these guys and I will never use anyone else to move me, asking as I\u2019m in Montgomery. My only suggestion would be from the Administrative side... if someone is not using the web sight to book and doesn\u2019t know the routine... be a tad more communicative and call back sooner. But it all worked out and this , from a customers standpoint is a great company. With Integrity and not trying to rip you off. That\u2019s huge.

My daughter had been quoted $108 per hour with a minimum of 2 hours. The guys were very personable and polite.  Upon arrival, I asked that they move a 1 couch, 2 chairs, and 1 recliner to a space in the basement.  Because I knew that this was in addition to the task of the move that they were hired for, I full well expected to pay whatever the charge for this additional work. They\u2019d arrived at my daughter\u2019s apartment at 8am and presented me with the contract at 10:08am...2 hours and 8 minutes.  Seeing that the charge was $378, I inquired if the extra had been to move the other items.  To my surprise the young man told me that there was no additional charge, as we were being charged by the hour.  I then asked if that were the case, why were we charged almost double the contracted 2 hours.  He nicely explained that they charge from the time that they leave their office until they arrive back at the office and then there is a charge for cleaning the vehicle.  It felt like I was being fleeced but I did not object, considering that they\u2019d moved the other items.  I paid and provided a $50 tip for each of them and before going on their way, the young man with the paperwork asked that I please provide them a review on GOOGLE...Well here it is...After going down to the basement, I was beyond appalled and unsettled by the haphazard an uncaring manner that they left the items that they moved for me.  Both chars thrown above the couch, the cushions were scattered about the floor and the recliner had been taken apart.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why these items were placed in this manner,  It took more work to disassemble and place them in such disarray, that it would have to place them in a neat order.  Further, when my husband arrived home, he located the handle for the recliner in the street.  In all honesty, I fault myself for not going down into the basement while they were there.  I just never could have imagined that this is how they left things, especially after being asked to write a review. Just so we\u2019re clear...I would never use or recommend this moving company.

We contacted Power Movers immediately once we learned of our closing to get them to complete the move, but they were booked.  So we ended up hiring another company.  When the other company began to load their truck from the storage that Power Movers had loaded to the brim, by the way, the new movers were shocked at how much was broken.  Much was broken, but I only mentioned to Power Movers, one thing, the most significant to us, an antique desk that their men had wrapped too tight with plastic and apparently how they lifted it the top had come off.  The new movers pointed this out to us before they touched the peice so that we would know they had not done it.  Will, the owner of Power Movers wouldn\u2019t hear me out while I was trying to relate the situation to him.   He  kept cutting me off while I was talking, tried to accuse the new movers of the damage and even suggested that we had possibly gone in our own storage and caused the damage ourselves when he knew there was no way anyone could have stepped a foot in that storage because they had it packed to the door with no walking room.  Unlike other moving companies that we have dealt with in the past and we were professional movers with the big name movers ourselves, they didn\u2019t want to make good on any damages or even own up to any which is unrealistic.

While the two gentlemen that showed up were very nice and polite, there were items that were on my contract that didn't get moved (which weren't noticed until hours later). I originally had a fridge and dining room table with 8 chairs listed on my contract (in addition to other items) and added a few things to the contract (which I paid extra to be moved).  I was doing a double closing and my son stayed at the house to oversee. I let (showed) the guys know which items needed to be moved. My son was packing up the remainder of the house. When the guys were ready to leave, they did a quick \"walk-through\" with my son (who didn't know what was on the contract and had other things going on). Upon my return and when we realized they forgot the fridge and 3 chairs, I called the office to let them know so they could return to get the items (my son and I were on a deadline to get out of the house since the house was no longer mine). My son & I got into our respective vehicles (me to drive the 26' U-Haul truck) and headed to Florida. We dropped off the U-Haul and turned around to head back to the old house to get my truck from my neighbor's house (at no time did I hear my phone ring). Upon our return to Florida at 9:30 pm, I checked my phone and received the voicemail from the office stating that they were trying to contact me.  I tried calling back but received no answer. I called them the next morning and figured that since I couldn't get into the old house, I would chalk up the loss of the fridge and just go buy a new one. I received a call from Darius and told him that at this point, I just wanted the bill adjusted to remove the price of the fridge since it was never moved. I was told NO and he started going into well, that's what happens when you add stuff to your contract (which I reminded him that I had PAID for those additional items). Again I stated that I just wanted the bill to be adjusted for the item that they didn't move and that that would be the end of it.

In efforts to keep our integrity at a high standard, allow us to explain our side of the story for our viewers and potential customers. Everything that we mention here will be a reference to the contract that you signed. In the contract that you signed, \u201cline 7\u201d states that we require the customer to be present during the move. Furthermore, we require the customer to inspect each location prior to departure. By this condition alone you have failed to keep up with contract that you signed. You left your son(older gentleman) in charge, whom you now say didn\u2019t know what was on the contract. We as a company have seen this many times before. You left the responsibility of your move into the respected hands of your son whom you trust and we trusted that by your decision to do so, that we would move accordingly. By this shift in responsibility, your son had full authority on what stayed and what go. Also, in \u201cline 7\u201d the customer is responsible for doing a walk through to VERIFY ALL ITEMS are collected and the LOAD PERFORMED MEETS THE APPROVAL OF THE CUSTOMER. In continuance of \u201cline 7\u201d, if the customer fails to do this, any items left behind is the responsibility of the customer. After this Condition of the contract, is where a customer is to initial and your son had done so. Understanding that Mr.Hanlon has full authority since your absence, we decided to not only perform ONE, but TWO walk throughs with Mr.Hanlon. Furthermore, he agreed that everything was loaded up for departure to his new home. And also to mention he paid for ours services. Let\u2019s fast forward. We\u2019re just about done with the unload, assembling and staging furniture with no customer in sight. We received a call about the refrigerator being left behind after the walk through was performed. Our policy states \u201cthe customer takes full responsibility of any item(s) left behind after performing a walk through of their home\u201d.

You stated that you hadn\u2019t received any phone calls in which we have the phone logs to prove that\u2019s inaccurate.  (The same logs we sent to you personally) Your request for an adjustment towards the bill was denied because of your abominable attitude and perfidious approach. We implore that you motion this situation to the law or the BBB because we have the signed contracts, phone logs and three witnesses to prove the inaccuracy of your statement.

I relocated from Alabama to Georgia and used this company to move some of my belongings into a pod. Well, the movers that arrived were not prepared to move much of the items they were to move. Because I was in Georgia, my realtor agreed to oversee the move. She called me stating that the guys were cramming things in the pod haphazardly and was certain that many of the items would be damaged as they didn't bring any supplies to wrap or disassemble the items(e.g. Exercise mirror, bowflex treadmill). They were willing to scratch up the paint on my walls bringing the fully assembled gym equipment out of the room because they were not equipped with tools.\n\nThey finally agreed to go to the office building to get tools to bring back. So, what was to be a three hour move turned into an EIGHT HOUR move.\n\nLastly, my realtor told the head crew member to leave the key in the opened lockbox when they were done with the move. She wasn't able to stay on site for eight hours. The guys agreed to do so. She texted them about 30 minutes after they'd left the house, askin if they'd left the key in the lock box as instructed. The mover stated that he did NOT plave the key in the box but that he'd left the key under the mat on the front porch(below the OPENED lockbox). When she asked why he didn't leave the key in the lockbox, the mover responded, there's nothing we can do about it now, we've left.\n\nThe next morning the appraiser came to the home and the key was NOT under the mat. So, I had to reschedule my home inspection and pay a locksmith to change my locks. Especially since I still had a zero turn mower(10k), golf cart and other valuables still in my home that my husband was coming back to remove a couple days after they moved the items.\n\nI really feel their plan was to come back with the key and remove some of my belongings from the home. Why else would they agree to place the key in a lock box that was already \"opened\" and located above the mat they claimed they placed the key under. Makes no sense.\n\nSo, I decided to write a review. Only after trying to reach out to the owner several times about the issue of the key and never receiving a response. I did speak with the Operations manager and he was very nonchalant and rude. My realtor and I were both on the line and he wouldn't allow either of us to speak on the issues. He was very defensive and talked over us the entire time.\n\nI ended the call thinking, the most I can hope for is that my equipment in the pod isn't damaged when it arrives to Georgia and to just be grateful I changed my locks before whomever made it back with the key they \"wilfully failed\" to place in the opened lock box just above the mat they claimed they placed the key under.\n\nI truly encourage anyone searching for a moving company to please find another one. Moving is stressful enough. The last thing you need is to work with a company who's unprofessional and lack common decency and respect in servicing their clients. I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923a491073409:0x2725981c1fcf7a1e"}

On the phone and through our various email exchanges they sounded as if they were genuinely interested in our business!  Not only did Mr. Devri Hensley II ensure us that a crew would be there, he promised to maintain an open flow of communication with us, so we\u2019d know what to expect.\nThe only problem with all of this was that they didn\u2019t show up on the agreed upon date and time. Then we had another problem. No response. None whatsoever. Our numerous calls and voicemails have gone unanswered, ever since.\nNow, since they have still failed to call us back or provide explanation, I\u2019ll ask the questions here with hopes of getting some sort of response below:\nFirst, why have you done this to us? It was pretty awful having to call friends and family, last minute, to help us move, quickly. (They appreciate you too, by the way.) We would have simply tried another moving company if you had only said something along the lines of, \u201cNo sir, we can\u2019t move you that day, we\u2019re booked full.\u201d Or if there were another reason that made sense, maybe we could have understood. After all, we consider ourselves pretty understanding. But not now.\nWhy won\u2019t you return our phone calls and emails? We understand stuff happens, but you\u2019re running a business. Now you\u2019ve just made yourself look completely and utterly incompetent. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for, because it seems to be, then congratulations!\nAnd lastly, I have to ask, why did you decide to open this business? Sometimes it\u2019s okay to admit when you\u2019re wrong. Maybe you should reconsider this.\nBut in all seriousness, unless you like being suddenly caught in overly-anxious situations, I\u2019d suggest everyone steer clear of Easy Moves.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923a491073409:0x2725981c1fcf7a1e"}

Purchasing a piano is a matter of very personal taste and preference...what matters most to David Ellis and his sons is quite simply whatever matters most to you.  My husband recently surprised me by taking me to Ellis to pick out the piano of my dreams.  While they could have pushed me to purchase on the spot, they did exactly the opposite and accommodated me on multiple visits to make certain I went home with the instrument I not only liked....but with which I fell in love (as did my husband).  They went out of their way to educate us about the instruments and encouraged me not to settle.  Not once did I feel pushed to make a purchase.  David and his sons knew this was a very special gift from my husband and they went above and beyond to make sure it was all he wanted for me...and all I wanted as well.  The Ellis family knows pianos, they know the value of a good investment, they know the value of superior customer service, they are approachable and meet every pianist on their level - from the young child just beginning lessons to the most accomplished world-renown performers and everyone in between and they treat them all with the same utmost care and respect.  When you select a piano from Ellis, you receive not only a stellar instrument suited just for you, but also the benefit of a family legacy based on fulfilling musicians\u2019 dreams.  If you\u2019re in the market for a piano, question no further where you should go...Ellis Piano is your answer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a3544961c1:0x4e608e6bb337b439"}

It was an absolute scam, as I have moved multiple times and have NEVER been charged this much for movers. Last week, I hired 2 movers for 2 hours and told it would be $129 for these 2 hours. When the move was complete I was then charged a total of $380 for 1.5 hours of work. When I called to verify why I was being charged $250 more than originally promised, they claimed it was a \u201ctravel fee\u201d for the movers to travel to my apartment in downtown Birmingham. This was never explained to me and it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that I paid ~$400 for 1.5 hours of work for the movers to load 15 items into the uhaul that I provided!!! And I I tipped the movers $40 without knowing about these extra \u201ctravel fees\u201d so my total was $420.

I was also told all furniture was off the truck when I discovered my bedroom nightstand was missing.  I found this and a busted chest of drawers with clothes spread out under blankets so I would not find them. Brads response was for me not to worry about it that he\u2019d take care of me.\nAll boxes, TV\u2019s, and hanging clothes were moved independently.  They were strictly moving furniture.\nI did everything I was instructed to do to file my claim and have yet to hear back from the insurance company.

They showed up on Saturday the 26th of December and one of them had on house shoes. It was 2 males and one female, they worked fast, but once we arrived at the new house for them to unload the truck they walked around and looked lost. I watch the female drop my bedside table, then they hurried and left without putting my kitchen table back together that they took apart, or putting my tv back on the stand they took it off of to move it. I\u2019ve called and spoke to Larry about the matter at hand which was of course all my fault, and I have yet to hear from customer service on the damages done to my belongings. I will not recommend using this company unless you have the ability to micromanage them the entire time they\u2019re there. Half of my boxes are missing, and no one at the company cares to help find the boxes or help with my belongings. Also I was quoted one amount, and charged double that amount, even with the damages and missing items.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ede3ecc47dd:0x6e0df98ae12a8cda"}

We moved 5.6 miles down the road. They had no boxes to move only furniture. We took the bed apart and the mirror off our dresser. There was no sofa to move.  This still took them 8 hours to complete! They took multiple smoke breaks. Moved at a turtles pace. Argued with each other. Bad mouthed my husband when they did not realize I was standing right behind them. Took an hour lunch break when they are only allowed 30 minutes. When we called to ask where they were they stated they had to stop and run a few errands. They scratched up multiple pieces of furniture. Put dents in the floor and walls. But what really really was the final straw and what prompted me to post this review was the fact we are about to paint so pulled out dresser out and found a huge hole in the back!!!! Instead of being honest about it they thought they could hide it bc how often to pull out large furniture. You can't miss it either it is right by where the mirror attaches. Refer back to where I stated we took that mirror off ourselves.. that is how I know it was not damaged prior. The bedroom set is only 1 year old.

This company has been nothing more than a headache. My wife and I met a very professional man who guaranteed our furniture and home would be taken care of from the move. We were blown away and felt like this was the obvious choice from other companies. On move day they were hours late. To the point where we were rushing to get off the property before the new owners arrived. Only one of the 3 guys worked the whole time and the others were constantly on their phone sitting in the truck. As you can imagine this made the move out considerably longer. They damaged a wall in the staircase multiple times. It looks horrible. The new home owners were upset with what they were left with. My wife and I contacted the office and informed of the damage in which they made it seem like they would take care of it. Well it\u2019s now 3 weeks later and they have just advised we need to provide them an estimate. Why was this not stated weeks ago. They have attempted to give us $180 to repair a desk, bed, and dresser, and wall. That is ridiculous. Now it\u2019s to the point where I just want the wall fixed and that not enough to pay a handy man to drive out to provide an estimate and then have to go back for the repair. I could not be more disappointed and dissatisfied. You could do better to hire literally anyone else.\n\nPs. The driver/mover was the only positive thing about the move after it started.

We booked with All My Sons for our Saturday move a few weeks in advance. My husband spoke to MULTIPLE different reps, male and females, confirming that movers would be at our house at 8:00am. On the day of our move, we got a call saying, \u201cthe crew never showed up\u201d and they were going to be late. 9:00am rolls around, and we get another call saying they won\u2019t be there until 9:45am. Frustrated that we have now lost 2 hours of moving time (moves are already high-stress to begin with without the added frustration of movers not showing), I call the office to express my concerns. Enter the ever-so-lovely \u201cNate\u201d, who I HOPE does not have a \u201cManager\u201d title to his name. If so, you should seriously reconsider. Argumentative, rude, arrogant\u2026the list goes on. Nate probably needs a refresher in Customer Service 101, \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d. Nate tells me that their moves start from \u201c8-10am\u201d, so \u201ctechnically\u201d they weren\u2019t late and \u201cno one would have told us they were going to be there by 8am\u201d. I explained that we spoke with MULTIPLE people and that was not the case\u2026.we were assured they would be there at 8am. After a few LOVELY back and forths with this Nate character, he says, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m cancelling your move and you can find someone else.\u201d\n*Click*\nHe hangs up the phone. If you are the owner of All My Sons, please know that you have someone representing your business in the POOREST way. I have already submitted a complaint to the BBB.

Cancelling someone\u2019s day-of service because they receive a VALID complaint is beyond me and I hope there are repercussions for Nate treating people the way he does.

After talking among themselves, they determined the move had to take place and promptly began to wrap and carry things to the truck parked on the street.\nAn hour into the move came the 560# gun safe which they gang tackled and rolled with the aid of only a set of hand trucks.

All my son's doesn't care about a good portion of jobs because the workers have 2 0r 3 jobs a day and they either hurry up and damage things or they milk the clock and overcharge on materials.

This time, this was a local move.  It was an easy move for the movers as well.  I had already taken most of our things, but I hired All My Sons to move a few dressers, an fridge, washer, dryer, and a couple of game tables.  We also had a large piece of furniture in storage.  But, they didn't have to move beds, clothes, dishes, etc.  The move should have taken about 2-3 hours.\n\nMy move was scheduled to start at 8am.  At 7:45am, I received a call that due to DOT requirements, the driver could not arrive until 10-10:30am.  I get it.  I work with DOT every day.  But this was poor scheduling and the last-minute notice wasn't pleasing, but I was willing to let it slide.  But the driver did not arrive until 11:45am.  I had an important appointment at 2pm that day.  I told the driver we needed to get moving.  He replied saying his boss called him at 10am wanting to know if he could work.  Now, I finally know the truth.\n\nAt first, the guys were moving well.  They loaded up the house in about 35 minutes.  I was pleased.  Then we dropped by our storage unit and the driver was more interested in looking at our pictures or checking out our motorized toys.  At this point, I knew he was dragging his feet and running up the clock.  They finished the move in about 4.5-5 hours.  We were moving to a new home that we built.  They scratched the staircase in two places pretty severely.\n\nI spoke to the supervisor and told him about my complaints.  He asked me what I was looking for.  I told him I would leave the resolution up to him, but I knew if I ran my business with this type of communication and lack of urgency, I would lose my customers.  He responded, \"Well, you were moved today and the guys have to get paid.\"  So, I paid, but I promised myself I would leave reviews everywhere I could.  I was completely disappointed.\n\nThe response below seems to be the same cut and paste response issued by All My Sons to every negative review.  I gave All My Sons the opportunity to make the transaction right over the phone.  I told them I would leave the remedy up to them and the response I got was, \"You got moved today and the guys have to be paid.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536595536947, "text": "Hi Ryan, thank you for leaving your feedback.

We were told 8-9 am but when it reached 8:30 we called local office and spoke to someone named Chris. He sounded very rude on the phone. Apparently had a few issues that morning delaying crew getting to our house. So they finally arrived later in morning. Everything was off to ok start until I noticed a lot of cursing going on that was upsetting. I asked them to please tone it down and be professional. That just pissed them off even more to the point they were being very careless with the furniture. The manager Chris was calling crew throughout day over and over and over yelling and screaming at top of his lungs to where I could hear every word from across the room in kitchen. I asked what was that? And crew said oh he's always like that. So now crew is trying to rush and throw everything on truck on top of already not doing a great job. One of the crewmen even made the comment we are way overworked and underpaid and management is horrible. Needless to say we have a lot of damage, the movers hate management and their jobs, and we had to pay for a horrible move. I spoke with friends afterward who encountered a lot of these same issues. Even had same issue with managers calling a ridiculous number of times. Get these people out of business as this seems to be a reoccurring issue.

Very unprofessional, unethical and plain rude!!!!!  I WISH I HAD READ PREVIOUS REVIEWS BEFORE I SCHEDULED A MOVE!  AAANND I WISH I COULD RATE THEM A ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI called several weeks in advance to schedule a moving date. The customer service was awesome! I even called back several other times to verify some other information.  NEVER  IN ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WAS I GIVEN DIRECTIONS HOW TO SET UP MY HOUSE FOR MY MOVE!!!\nSaturday, April 13,  2019  the movers arrived. They walked through then had me to sign some papers. They begin to move a few things. The heavier set gentleman was on the phone. Still no moving going on! The next thing I know a lady shows up , introduces herself and said she was doing a walk through. I said okay. She walked my town house and stated to me that I need to clean my dresser off. There was some sticky residue on there. I said okay and cleaned the dresser.  I went back to sit down. I noticed they had packed my TV and I needed it because Direct TV was headed to the new location. My friend was coming to pick it up the TV.  I went to the truck to get the TV. The manger and the heavier set guy were behind the truck smoking cigarettes. So I asked,  \"Were we moving anything today.\" \"You all are on a smoke break and nothing has been moved!\" She said , no ma'am.  We are getting ready to move you. \"I suppose what I said led to what happened next\"  She sent  the African American guy into my town house to let me know they had to CANCELED my move today.  I guess because I was African American that was the reason for sending him. He had no explanation. I asked since she was the manger why didn't she come and tell me what the problem was and why my move was canceled.  He said she a White lady. In other words, he was sent to do the dirty work! By this time I am furious! I call the office and some gentleman couldn't really explain either. He just said it was cancelled. I used some unprofessional words and hung the phone up. I called back to speak to her and she stated that there was no room for their dollies to pass through, there was an odor and it was not clean. All of those were lies! I don't know any place that will be clean when you are moving.  I had all of my boxes and bags in one  location. They were labeled and separated.  The only items upstairs were the bedrooms. I used some more unprofessional , choice words again! My issue with the entire thing is NO ONE explained to me how to set up for the move or came our prior for a walk through. SHE told me that was COMMON SENSE! I gave some more unprofessional , choice words.  I live in a town house which does not have a lot of room. I can not help how many items I had. I did contact corporate office and explained EVERYTHING! I even expressed that I used unprofessional words and I did apologize to the corporate office.  Thank God I have awesome family and friends!!! They moved me with no hesitation and never complained. What about the people who don't have family and friends in the city!  Treat people how you want to be treated!  KARMA is for real!!!!

The pricing is super straight forward, and the  is charged by a flat by the hour fee, with no hidden costs - it made it easy to help budget. I then received a follow up call from the local team that would be handling my move, personally introducing themselves and making sure I didn't have any additional questions.  However, the move day itself is actually what floored me... this was no easy move, I was downsizing my parents from a 4 bedroom house with a basement full of stuff to a two bedroom apartment - so the move involved a LOT of stuff and several stops (between storage and the new place).  Quinton (the driver) and his team (Quinteze, Jamaul and Colin) showed up right on time, moved quickly and efficiently, and never once acted like anything was a problem! They really went above and beyond, even taking items that we planned to give away down to the basement for us. These four guys were so nice and helpful, and really made what was a tough and challenging move for me, seem easy!

They showed up an hour earlier than we expected and we were not prepared. The staff was nice  and they did not waste anytime getting loaded. When I arrived to the house my wife was disappointed. When we called AMS to arrange the move we asked them if they could assemble some items. My wife was told they disassembled and assembled. When my wife showed the men the items she was told her they would only assemble what they had previously disassembled at the pickup. It might have been a misunderstanding on our end, but I'm not sure why it would be a problem since they charge by the hour. The most disappointing part was the damages caused to our house. We know these men are working hard and furniture can be difficult to move through hallways and doors so we expected minor scratches/dents might  occur, but in two places the damage was beyond what I would call minor. The casing on the front door and one of the hallways has chunks of wood taken out of them.  While we still would have been annoyed.. If we had we been notified during the move we would have let it go. Nobody said anything about the damages and now we will have to make repairs to work that was just completed.

I've used 2 different moving companies in the last year, All My Sons and 2 Men & A Truck. In short, I'll likely be using 2 Men going forward because it was just a better experience overall and worth the difference in rate per mover.\n\nPositives: The All My Sons (AMS) hourly rate, per mover, is far less than the competition in the field. Their sales staff is persistent in booking orders (which I like - some don't). They call a lot to check in and see what they can do to help. The movers didn't really sit around; they moved with purpose most of the time. The movers were very nice and did everything they could to provide good service.\n\nNegatives: We were scheduled for 8-8:30am arrival; they didn't show up until 10:30am. Furthermore, I had to be the one to call to find out why they were late (had to call 3 times). The operations gentleman/rep that I talked to about their delayed arrival was straight forward but more in the sense of being border line rude. Just my opinion at that time; and I'll admit I was heated & mad having to call 3 times so the rep could have been nice the whole time but I wasn't truly listening...the underlying issue had something to do with the moving truck needing gas and their gas card limit was too small for what the moving truck needed; getting approval for the gas was what created the delay. Ultimately, the ops office set up the movers for failure.\n\nMoot Points: I don't know that the movers were properly prepared for my move. I don't know if I did a poor job of describing what's going to be moved, or if AMS didn't communicate to the moving team.\n\nBottom Line: I needed a moving company to move items. AMS did that. I wasn't blown away by their service.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1477920573821, "text": "Matt, Thank you for your valuable feedback, we are sorry we did not meet your expectation on your relocation with us.

I arrived two days later to discover most of the furniture was thrown in the basement, only one bed had been properly assembled and the boxes were unloaded on the 1st floor of a three floor townhouse without even walking space. Also my king size bed was left to \u201cappear\u201d assembled but when I began to look closer at it, it was only set together and all the screws were left in a pile under the bed itself.

I've dealt with MANY moving companies over the years and while they aren't the worst I've dealt with (Allied...AWFUL) they weren't as professional as I'd like to see. They've moved items for me on two different occasions. The first time they moved some items from my house to a storage unit. In the process, they damaged my piano. To this day, they haven't repaired it.\n\nDue to a lack of variety/choices when it comes to movers in this area, I decided they were the best option for a more significant move about a year later. I figured I'd give them another shot. It started off on a sour note, when they showed up nearly 2 hours later than the time we agreed upon for the start of the move. During the process, some of our antique furniture was damaged because it wasn't padded the way we requested.\n\nFinally, after paying for the move with a check I was informed that they'd LOST it later that afternoon. This required me to place a stop payment on the original check and potentially compromised my sensitive account and personal information. I requested compensation for this mishap and the manager agreed to reimburse a small portion of the move and to cover the cost of the stop payment.\n\nOverall, I have dealt with MANY more professional companies. The problem is, when you live in a small town like Daphne, AL the competition is few and far between and there is less effort to provide exemplary service. Honestly, if there were other options I'd look elsewhere.

I expected 2 guys but it was just him and his pickup truck. At first I was mad, but then the first piece he moved was an 17th Century French Armoire that weighed 673 lbs by himself. Needless to say, I was impressed. I was even more surprised when he picked up my king size mattress and carried down the spiral staircase without touching anything. But when he took his shirt off to pack the kitchen, I knew he was good. He must\u2019ve been doing it a long time due to his chiseled physique and bulging muscles. Anyone who got him as your mover, was extremely lucky. Will use again.\nOn a more serious note, the lady ( k8lusterio )\nThat tried to say I gave her a bad estimate. I remember you. First off, in 99.9% of cases, it\u2019s twice as fast to carry boxes than to dolly them. The dolly is for lazy people who don\u2019t want to work. Secondly, you had more stuff than would fit on one truck, which means you were not truthful about how much stuff you had to move. NEVER, would I have given a 5 hour estimate on a job that was going to be more than one truck. Especially going from Daphne to Mobile. It\u2019s like this, most people were happy with us when I was there, and most are satisfied now. However, in my 15 years of moving I have learned that when people CALL to get an estimate, a small minority will not be forthcoming with what they have, hence they get a low ball estimate so when the bill comes they will try not to pay, or remind you of the estimate. Things that impact your price on a move.\n1. Be honest with what you\u2019re really moving\n2. Get as close to an accurate count of boxes as you can. That\u2019s a big one. Some people guess 25, and they really have 125. Boxes take more time than furniture.\n3. Be honest about access. Don\u2019t tell the estimator that your driveway is nice and flat and no stairs into the house, then they get there and it\u2019s a steep drive they can\u2019t even get up with 8 stairs going into the house. Or it\u2019s a winding driveway that really needs a 14 ft truck instead of a 24ft so it can maneuver and not get off in your grass.\n4. Move as much of the little stuff as possible. The big furniture is easy and fast to move.\n5. List any difficult pieces you know your prior movers had a hard time with. Or if special tools are needed. Mostly they will show up with a Phillips, flathead, pliers, and Allen wrenches. Some guys have more, but you can generally take down a house and put it back up with those tools.\nLike I said, most people are satisfied, there is a small minority that you will never please. That\u2019s true in any field you choose, but especially moving. It\u2019s not cheap to move, and it\u2019s definitely not cheap to own a moving company. Trucks are expensive, pads, dollies, insurance. You don\u2019t want movers making $8 hr, or you will get $8 hr movers. So most of the companies pay relatively well. And chances are, whatever moving company you choose, you will end up with movers that used to work for the company you\u2019ve been complaining about. Moving company employees are a lot like servers in the food industry. You sort of get stuck in the job and bounce around from moving company to moving company depending on management and who\u2019s paying more per hr. Motivated has the longest tenured people that you\u2019ll find of any moving company. In the end, go with your gut. DO NOT go with someone just because they are cheaper. Remember, $5 extra an hour may just get you some really experienced movers that can get you done faster and save you money over the cheaper labor that may drag the job out.\nI miss my time in this industry, sort of. I loved helping people in that kind of stressful time and 95% of the time they were ecstatic because we worked hard and fast to save them money.\nGood luck to anyone moving.

Four hours from the start, his men were still at the old house where there were still the TV, treadmill, total gym and gorilla racks to load.

Everyone had bad stories to say against the other and everyone I was speaking with had horrible reviews.  I then went on Thumbtack and requested quotes for movers, that's where I found About The Move.  I received a quote right away and a follow-up call from Tammy to go through all of the items being moved to give me a very good estimate.  I really liked that the pricing was hourly based as opposed to how many boxes and truck capacity I was using.  The real deciding factor for me was that I would have the same crew loading my items, driving them to my destination, and unloading them - also, that my items would not be mixed with any other household's belongings on the truck.  Tammy worked with me through the booking process and even gave me options to move my date based on last-minute changes if we needed to.  JR and Sunshine did an impeccable job!  They were polite and professional and really went above and beyond to ensure the safety of my items as well as having to lift part of my sectional couch over the backyard fence to get it out of the house.  When arriving to our new house 405 miles away, they worked quickly and professionally ensuring that all items that were disassembled were put back together and set up just how they found them.  I really cannot say enough good things about this company.  The pricing estimate was on-point and straightforward with no extra/unexpected fees.  They collected a small deposit prior to the move to hold my spot and I was able to complete the final payment via credit card after everything had been delivered to my new house and I was satisfied.  We moved from Destin, FL to Tampa, FL and everything was complete within a 24-hour period.  This company is a class act and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for reputable movers whether local or long-distance.  I will definitely call them again when I need movers.
