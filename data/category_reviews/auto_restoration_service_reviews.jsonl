On 3 July I took my GS350 to have the tint removed from my rear glass and have it replaced with ceramic tint that I purchased from tintzoom online for $200.00. When I arrived the owner and I agreed on a price of $190.00 to do all window with the exception of the left front and left rear (I had already installed it) with the tint I supplied. Having done over 50 tint jobs at a reputable local shop while in college (10 years ago) I know the proper way of installing tint, but being a little rusty I decided to take it to a professional to ensure the tint was removed properly (Steamer or Ammonia and Black Bag). After pulling the car into the shop to start the job I noticed the CARWASH DETAILER with a razor blade hacking at the tint in the rear window. I immediately asked him to stop and asked the owner to take over before he ruin the rear glass defroster. I then left with my ride that was waiting (big mistake) and had him take me to the bank to get cash for the job.  When I returned my car was supposedly ready. I looked at my rear package and it was covered with tint scrapings and my defrost lines were no longer black they were gold (as in no longer working from scraping with a razor). I also noticed that my 3rd brake light was torn to pieces, and there were several pieces of tint left on the window with new film laid on top of it. Soon after I spoke with the manager to inform him of my displeasure with the services rendered. The first thing I asked the owner about was my 3rd brake light and his answer was \u201cWe had to break it to put the film on.\u201d The second was my defroster his response was\u201d We had to get the tint off.\u201d The third issue with this humbling experience was the patches of old tint eft on the window with new tint installed over it, in which I received no response from the owner. My response to the owner was \u201cI am not paying for this,\u201d so he decided to vacuum some of the tint from the rear package tray and reduce the price to $165.00 since he broke my $250.00 3rd brake light. After I still refused to pay we both called the police (Little did he know I was on the phone with a good friend who is deputy chief of police). So between the times the police arrived he decided to rip the tint off the windows and throw my $200.00 ceramic tint in the trash, despite his wife warning him not to. When the police arrived he lied about ripping the tint off and even said I didn\u2019t bring any tint to him and stated that he supplied the tint. After looking at the car the officer asked why is there just tint on the driver side windows, I stated that is because those were the windows I did myself. To end the story the officers did nothing (OF COURSE) and stated it was a civil matter which is probably true. Long story short I am out $568.49 to replace the rear glass to get my defrosters back (plus installation), $200.00 for the ceramic tint that he decided to rip from the window and throw in the trash, and $250.00 for my 3rd brake light the he tore up. PLEASE do not go to the poor established called Customized Auto Detail & Window Tinting or you will receive a humbling experience like mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b785508b9fb:0xfffd9e0f9eb61f62"}
