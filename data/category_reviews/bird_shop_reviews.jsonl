He ordered 4 happy huts for me in yellow. They are very hard to find. Our bird of course did not know how hard they were to find lol she is 23 years old a blue crown so alas we are using one for spare parts to add to her happy hut she has had for ever. I found everyone I encountered wonderful at Bird Buffet. Even when I asked to return 3 of them Michael was more than accommodating. What can I say you find gems in the world and Bird Buffet N Things is one of those gems.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e8fbb18b39b17:0xa7a6e8cfd2425cd2"}
