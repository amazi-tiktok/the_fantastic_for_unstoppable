After taking down all the info, we had a detailed quote, with various coverage options, e-mailed to us within minutes. While talking with her the following day about these options, she patiently answered all our questions and clearly conveyed information. Because she was so professional, upbeat, and intelligent, we decided that this is exactly the type of person we wanted to work with. So, besides the car insurance, we decided to move ALL our insurance (Car, Home, and Wind) over to her at Allstate.

I have been a customer of this agency (policies including homeowner\u2019s, multiple autos, and a boat) for approximately 5 years.  I had a claim due to a flash flood damaging a vehicle.  The claim process was a nightmare, mostly due to working with virtual/out-of-state adjusters (something Bryan\u2019s agency was apparently unaware of).\n\nIt took over a month to get the claim settled - currently on day 34 and the claim is still open.  The car was eventually totaled on day 22, but later Allstate decided they would rescind that decision and repair it (after I had purchased a replacement).  Later, they changed again and totaled it.\n\nOn day 13, I emailed the office manager and asked that Bryan call me.  I understand the agency does not directly deal with claims, but they can assist and advise where necessary, especially when the process is a bad experience for their customers.  Instead, his office manager called me, provided no assistance, and seemed surprised that Allstate does not have auto adjusters in Birmingham (where this agency is selling auto policies).\n\nAccording to the multiple solicitation emails I receive weekly, customer service is very important to this agency.  I have emailed Bryan three times and asked that he call me as stated above.  As of today (day 34), Bryan has not called nor contacted me outside of solicitation emails trying to sell me additional products and services.\n\nI eventually had to file a formal Department of Insurance complaint against the company and the agency.

It's like the credit union version of insurance (I think! I'm still new to the concept). I know not everyone will get the lower price, but if you haven't tried, seriously give these ladies a call.\n\nOLD review: I'll be honest - I haven't met the agent, and I haven't spoken to anyone in the office at length. But to me, this simply speaks of the efficiency this office is working at. If I have an issue, boom, done by the front desk. Taken care of. Five minutes or less. Need to make an extra payment?

We were solid paying customers and paid 6 months in advance the entire time we had the policy. My wife and I just merged bank accounts...so we contacted our agent and had the account switched to the merged account since we were planning to close the other one out... Allstate told us it was taken care of. Not True! - So we realized something was wrong when we got a notice (which was the 1st notice we had received) stating that our policy coverage had been terminated because of failure to make payment. We called the agent office and informed them that we had received the notice and apparently the amount of time it takes for the bank account changes to take place didn't kick it into effect until they had already tried to auto draft the payment from the wrong account and therefore instead of calling us to let us know, they just sent us a letter after the policy was terminated. So at this point I called to discuss with an agent on the Friday when we found out to see what could be done  because we were supposed to be going out of town and currently had no insurance coverage... I spoke with a very polite office admin in which I asked her to see if there was anything that could be done.... in which she obliged but she informed us that she would need to call the underwriter and make sure they were going to reinstate the policy, which we didn't think would be an issue because we had not had any accidents/accident claims while we had been under the related policy. So we get a call back about 2 hours later that the underwriter was not going to reinstate the policy because during the term of the coverage, my wife had made a claim to have a cracked windshield replaced in which she asked the agent before making the claim and was told that it would not go against us in regards to our policy or premium because it was part of what was covered under the policy that we were paying for. We asked them to see if there was a manager or agency owner that could do anything to correct the situation but apparently our local office manager was on vacation and the other branch managers that were supposedly contacted either weren't really contacted or didn't care because we were never contacted again and ended up having to find a new insurance coverage through a different agency. This was probably the worst I have ever been treated from a customer service standpoint in consideration that we are always good prompt paying customers and the fact that our bill not getting auto-drafted was attributed to Allstate's screw-up and then we weren't notified until our policy had already been cancelled and then they used the most petty excuse to not re-instate our policy.

I did not get any response from the company so I called them they said they would have a rep call me back we\u2019ll I never got a call instead I got an email stating my mother\u2019s death certificate had status of divorced and I had to provide them a copy of the divorce decree. I checked with the county clerks office in Erie county New York and was told that those records are sealed pursuant to New York State law and that the only people that can view them are the plaintiff,defendant or attorneys of record so I called protective back and was told someone would call me back. SUPRISE no call back again so I called again and asked to speak with a supervisor and I was connected to John who stated he would look into it and call me back the next day. Guess what no call back again. I called them again and after being put on hold was told that everything was ok and I didn\u2019t need to do anything  After another week went by I called to check the status of my claim and was told I had to provide a copy of my parents divorce decree I explained again that I could not provide it because my parents divorced 49 years ago and were no longer alive my father passed years before my mother took out the policy. I was told I needed to provide a copy of my fathers death certificate in order for them to process my claim. By the way did I mention I am listed as the sole beneficiary on the policy.... I should not have to provide anything but my mother\u2019s death certificate which I did in the first place. I just faxed a copy of my fathers death certificate today let\u2019s see what excuse they come up with next not to pay on my claim. I will probably have to sue them for what is rightfully mine left to me by my late mother. This company should be ASHAMED\n\nUpdate\nProtective insurance got back to me to make sure the claim was closed and they listened to my concerns and stated that they would try to improve their call backs moving forward.

First I was dealing with a girl that we will call C. She was sweet. She helped me start up my policy and because I was alone on this, I was new to everything. She assured me that everything would be okay and that things would work out and they did.....for a while. My bill fluctuated so much and at one point they managed to withdraw from my account twice with in a three month range and overdraft my bank account, see C knew I wouldn't have the funds for this stuff until a certain date and I was told by another rep at this office that  my stuff couldn't be withdrawn from my account on the day that I wanted. It had to be there way. I never saw, spoke to, or emailed with the representative in this office \"Rebekah brown\" instead I was shuffled over to another agent we will call her L. L took care of most of my stuff and because I didn't want the automatic withdraw she decided that it was OKAY for me to call in and make my payments. On the last day dealing with this particular office, I dealt with another agent and by then I had enough. I told this agent \"I do not want to speak to you do not call me back, I do not wish to deal with you, I am not going over anything with you.\" and this was because SHE wanted to change everything in my policy or do this and do that and this and that. All I wanted to know was WHY I was being charged 100$ more than what I was being charged the first go around. Now because of this office I AM WORKING with another agent and trying to UNWIND all the mess that was created by this office. It has been an absolute disaster. Here I am 3 months out from this agency and the new Agent is STILL cleaning up the mess created. Heck, at least I know who I am dealing with because they actually interface with their people, don't switch their people from agent to agent, and actually RETURN phone calls when they say they're going to call back. - Moral of the story - You want a faceless Rep? Go to this agency. Want someone who messes up the policy's and manages to make you pay for it all in one fell swoop?

He made me feel like I was his only customer, and it was refreshing getting to deal with a local agent rather than the remote 800 number services I was accustomed to.\n\nI had them do a quote, and was greatly surprised at the amount of coverages I could get for home and auto.  Pricing was very competitive, and I was able to obtain extraordinary coverages, along with umbrella, and discovered they can provide coverages for my business as well.\n\nThus far, I've had a great experience and would encourage others to consider using this office for your insurance needs if you're in Baldwin County.

Now that the van is there for two months I have tor remind them to fix the other recall.and why should I have to ? They should have that information.\nCheck all recalls !!! If not your loss .. they will make sure you don\u2019t get the fix that is required for the problem.  40,000 later in the cost of the van and it drives like its over The St  Andreas fault !!!\nNever mind to buy here again. Ford let me down and my Dealer also\nThe ford customer service is now handle by reps in the Philippines and they give you more of a hard time. What\u2019s sad is. Ford was once a American to the roots vehicle . Now it\u2019s just a another way to make a dime ... good luck with your purchase. I wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4f3ca0cc2a29:0x8ae6ac0293971cea"}

Unfortunately, at this point in time, I cannot say the same.  The new person that has been assigned to me does not return emails in a timely fashion. And due to this reason, over the past year I've had to pay a higher monthly amount in auto insurance because of the math being divided over a shorter number of months (she dragged her feet getting things done). She gave me apology after apology when I would ask \"What's going on??\". She was always \"so sorry about how long it's taken to get back to me..\" But unfortunately, that helps me NONE. I reached out in December 2016 to ask that they let me know if the auto premium would go up so that we could get a start on switching me to different insurance if necessary (in an effort to give them more time to work).  They said I needed to wait closer to the renewal date (Feb 20). I waited and reached out again on Feb 4. I got a response back on Feb 6 that said that they started a \"reshop\" and would let me know as soon as it was done. It's now Feb 25. Almost 3 weeks later... I've heard nothing. Which doesn't surprise me, but is still unacceptable. It's my understanding that Natalie (who use to handle my business SUPERBLY) is no longer there. Things seem to have gone to crap since.

{"user_id": "102392211144881263157", "name": "Lance Hearn", "time": 1493759894500, "rating": 1.0, "text": "I write this because I am not 100% in line with the response to Shunte Moore. My experience is near identical. I became a RedRock Customer in early 2014, they were great. I gave them a call, provided them with my info, and they came back a day later with the best deals from their contracted carriers. I chose The Hartford. I then had no contact with RR until January of 2016, when i asked if they could \"re-shop\" my rates. My original agent was gone. Several weeks and additional inquiries later I was told that The Hartford was still the best option for me. Seemed like a long time to have to wait, but everyone gets busy from time to time, no big deal.\nLast September, I purchased a new car and contacted RR to have it insured. I also changed coverage on my other cars. The new car was added, the new documents were received, and the automatic insurance payment kept coming out. In mid-November, I receive a notice from my Credit Union stating they had received an insurance cancellation letter on the new car. I contacted The Hartford directly and they confirmed the change had been initiated by RedRock. Apparently, RR had accidentally removed it from my plan completely, the day after it was added... I had been driving around for months without insurance coverage. (Coverage on other vehicles was incorrect as well) I had to backpay 3 months of premiums so that I wouldn't show a gap in coverage. (Robbery, since I would not have been covered had I been in an accident, but that was a Hartford policy that RR had no control over) I called RR and informed them of the situation. They basically respond \u201cSorry, people make mistakes.\u201d Not being sure they fully comprehended the gravity of the situation, I pressed the issue. I informed them that, unfortunately, I had no ideas to offer so far as a solution to the problem, but considering I could have been financially ruined had I been in an accident with no coverage, a simple \u201cWe are sorry\u201d would not suffice. Finally, I was informed that the manager had been notified, was deeply troubled by the situation, and would contact me. (Excellent, surely we will talk and he can apologize for the error and tell me about the failsafes they have implemented to make sure this never happens again) Alas, it has been 7 months and still no contact\u2026 I eventually dropped the issue because I don\u2019t have the time (kind of the whole reason I went with RR in the first place.)  They really did just make a mistake. We\u2019ve all made them. Things happen.\nThen, a few months ago, I get a letter from The Hartford stating they can not renew my homeowners policy because I am classified as a Fire Protection Class 10 (Too far from fire dept). I call RR and ask them to find me something new. No problem. \u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday, give us 48 hrs and we will contact you\u201d. I call back Friday, 72 hrs later. RR: \u201cThey are working on it. They have a few rates back and have a presentation scheduled with you for next Tuesday to go over the quotes.\u201d  I respond that there is no need for a presentation. They can email me the rates as they come in. They tell me they will send them over as they get them. In the mean time I have called pretty much every insurance company known to man and gotten quotes within about 3 1/2 minutes. So, the next Tuesday rolls around and, still nothing from RR. I gave them another week or so and never heard anything back. Now, granted I did have a few weeks before my policy ended, I didn't want to wait until the last minute to choose a new company nor did I want to give more money to a company that couldn't offer me coverage in the future. I settled on a new insurance company and called RR to cancel. They did get the cancellation documents to me quickly\u2026\nTL;DR: Makes requested policy changes promptly, but with little accuracy. Takes extended amounts of time to respond to general questions and inquiries. They accidentally canceled coverage on one of my cars, so I was driving around for several months with no insurance. Apparently this wasn\u2019t deemed important enough for a manager to contact me.
