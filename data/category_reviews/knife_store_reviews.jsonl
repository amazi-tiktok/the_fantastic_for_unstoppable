I don't see how anyone could eat a 12\" alone.  I didn't weigh the meat but I'd guess this was 2X the amount of meat & cheese as you'd get on a 12\" from Subway or Firehouse Subs and that's on a 6\" sandwich.  Bread was gourmet and excellent.  Probably the largest selection of unique sodas and bottled beverages I've ever seen at a restaurant.
