I was told that this info came directly from the TSI owners. They also said my doorbell video and other automations (lights, etc.) will not work if I canceled with them. They say that no other company will be able to use the equipment and it will only work with TSI since it was \"theirs\". They say that you cannot buy the Qolsys IQ Panel 2 online, because it comes from their dealer. This is all false.\n\nThey will also tell you that they don't know if they are allowed to cancel your account and that they don't know how to cancel accounts (and you have to call alarm.com to cancel). After multiple times calling alarm.com, I found out that you do in fact cancel with the dealer (TSI), not with them (they are just a third party software company). The lady at TSI needed to speak to her supervisor (but they were conveniently gone for the day), and she would call me first thing in the morning about if they can cancel/how to cancel my account (wouldn't you know, they never called back, I had to call them). The next morning, my call was passed around to 3 individuals until I spoke to somebody who wanted to make sure I 100% wanted to cancel my account (for all the reasons above). My alarm.com account was gone less than 5 minutes after I hung up. It was a fun few days of conversations.\n\nEdit: Thanks for responding M. Moore. I WAS a customer of yours, so I CAN leave a review on your company (I went to a different company because TSI is dishonest). Everything I've posted is 100% truth. You need to check your employees training if what you've read above is not how you want them interacting with customers.

The cellular device that is built into the Qolsys panel is registered to our company, TSI. You would need another company to replace that device. Of course the Qolsys panel is available online to anyone that would want to purchase it at a retail price. All the other automation devices that were installed in the home are also universal and can be used with any other company. You were not told that. That was your misunderstanding. You were actually told that the automation devices would no longer be free because TSI would no longer be providing that service. That is an agreement between TSI, DR Horton & the Alarm.com builder program. You can\u2019t just have some random company give you a free Alarm.com account. I would think this would clear up any confusion you have. Like I said it\u2019s very simple. You would need another company to replace the device.\n\nAlso please do not reach out to TSI to assist or help you for any other reason. We take our reputation and reviews very serious. We also do not appreciate you, who is not a customer going online as you if you are and giving our company a 1 star review. You are not a customer & do not reserve that right. We have been in business for 21 years. I can also tell you that during that time I have never been accused of being shady. That is slander! You need to be very careful with your words. We are upfront and honest to a fault. We did not tell people what they want to hear in order to make a sale. We have lost many opportunities & sales over the years for that reason.

Telephone Representative very helpful in setting up appt. She told me that there would be no charge for the service call as our monthly charge includes the warranty. Service appt. was for the next day - very quick in getting an appt. Service tech - Jonathon Givens - had to replace two door sensors. He then proceeded to tell my wife that our system was outdated and needed to be updated. He offered to update it for a $100 fee. My wife told him she would have to speak with me first before we agreed to anything resulting in a charge. Jonathon then asked my wife how long had we had our system. She told him three years in our current home and approximately seven years in our previous house (total of approximately ten years with ADT.)  He then said he'd go ahead and update our system for no charge, which he did. What was that about??  Offer to update the system for $100?  Would that be considered fleecing a client? And if he was going to update the system for $100, does he pocket the amount, since he updated the system anyway. Kind of \"sketch\" as the kids say these days.  I have not been impressed with ADT monitoring services in the past, and only continued service with them after the 2 year contract (at which time they were going to increase my monitoring price $10/month.)

I've been out of pocket for weeks trying to handle mom's business, grieve, and still live so I haven't had a chance to reschedule. ADT proceeded to still charge me two months of service at my old location even though they knew I had cancelled the service at my old house. When I caught it, the call center manager told me that they still bill you 30 days after you cancel. I asked about the other month and she said \"oh we prorated that and took it out of your installation fee.\" So I prepaid $100 for an install that I didn't get. And they took money out of my installation fee for two more months before I caught it. All this while they say sorry for your loss but...at least we gave you back the second month. So instead of $100 back I got about $50. Even during our time with them we were paying several months during one of their glitches and they weren't even monitoring my home.\n\nNo more ADT for me.

There is nothing more aggravating than to have your air conditioning unit quit. Although it is mid-October we needed our air conditioning fixed ASAP. Our unit was 17 years old and I knew we needed to replace it if not immediately, within the very near future. I emailed a few companies Saturday night asking for estimates and to please contact me Monday morning. Only Autumn Air and one other company returned my call today. Autumn Air was very pleasant and offered to have someone come out to price the unit immediately. Since I knew I did not want to start throwing money away repairing such an old unit I asked for a quote for a new unit (with and without the furnace). Skip came out and priced the unit with three options and it was clear if I wanted more options he would give them to me. He did not acted putout or frustrated with my request. He did not pressure me to make a decision nor did he push me to buy the most expensive product. Without me asking, he let me know the specials that were being offered. I asked how soon they could install the unit and he said either this afternoon or in the morning. I called my husband and sent him the estimates. My husband was impressed and even showed his fellow employees who were also impressed with the prices. After weighing the pros and cons we decided to replace the entire unit (with furnace). I called Skip back about 2:30 saying we did want to go ahead and replace the unit, he said he would call me right back, that it would be either this afternoon or in the morning. I was floored when he called me back shortly afterwards and asked if it was okay with me if they could install it today. Skip and two other gentlemen came and installed the unit working hard until close to 9:00 pm. We were all extremely grateful to the diligence of these men. In addition, Autumn Air included a 2-year service plan where they will come out to service/clean the unit twice a year. They have earned my trust.

{"user_id": "117764367263681419355", "name": "John Hosmer", "time": 1505317915712, "rating": 5.0, "text": "For a long while there have been atmosphere issues in our basement where the previous home owners had never taken care of sealing up the rooms and keeping temps and humidity in check. We had addressed those issues and we had tried using good filters at the returns to prevent as much of any dust, mold spores, etc. from recirculating and spreading, but it ended up being a losing battle for both comfort and our family's health.  Finally, about a month ago I disconnected one of the flexpipes at the end of the trunk run to see just how bad it was and found almost 100% coverage of dust, mold, and nastiness throughout the system. It was in every bit of the trunk, and every flexpipe throughout the house (See pictures). Even a few of the vent registers had started harboring mold growth which was a really bad sign as well.\n\nSo, I did what any good panicking homeowner would do at that point. Went to Google, pulled up nearby HVAC companies with good reviews that could do duct replacement, and called for appointments for onsite inspections. Out of the four highly reviewed and reputable companies (minus individual contractors) in the Pelham area that actually showed up for their appointment, Autumn Air's rep Baker was the only one who showed up on time, actually visually inspected inside the ductwork even after I showed him the initial pictures I took, and then spent a solid amount of time explaining to me options for replacing the entire ductwork system so we could see about what would be right for our budget. In the end, the price that Autumn Air was able to provide for an upgrade to a new round smooth metal interior and outside insulated wrapped system, including new boots and registers, throughout the entire house, plus a new central AprilAire Space Guard filtration and iWave-R GPS ionization system upgrade (per my request) beat out the one other company who actually sent me a quote by almost half. Let me say that again differently...TWO of the four companies NEVER sent back a quote. This told me that two of the highly reputable companies in the Pelham area that have a high amount of favorable reviews simply did not want a job. Pitiful for them.\n\nFast forward to the install a week later...Led by two guys named Javy and Charles, they took care of making sure everything was treated with care when taking out the old ductwork so as to minimize spreading of dirt and mold as much as could be. Then, they proceeded to assemble and install all of the new system on site for custom fitting plus making sure all seams were taped properly and coated with mastic so that the chances of air leaks past the coils is forever kept at a minimum. They arrived early in the morning, and worked until the job was finished that evening (on the day of Harvey storms coming through too!).  Any questions I had concerning anything with the job was answered and explained with no hesitation on their part.  They went beyond expectations with accommodations and I just can't be any happier.\n\nI can't say it enough in this entire description here how great Autumn Air is for an HVAC company. They want someone's business in the best way because they give the work the best service they can at reasonable prices, and offer great financing options too if needed. They understand how to go the extra mile to make sure the customer is being taken care of in the end as well. I can say I have also had the pleasure of meeting Jeff, the owner, later when he came back to look at a minor issue that crept up post install, and he is just as awesome about discussing more than the \"here's what we'll do\". He takes the time to explain the why and how's (if you are interested to know and ask) and will work with you as a customer to do everything he can within reason to make sure you are satisfied with him and his company. Because of all of these things described about everyone at that company and how we were treated, we now not only have clean, sanitized fresh air, but the confidence to know it will stay that way due to the complete service and professionalism we got from Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMabAWy162GH96gyl3m37sUEbn3lZkhH_QMnw5p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_X0ScvBCZDov4a77tJ8--jNZxa4SLKPRwf7ZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2_SRCsbshQYMwunCW_Svt09o-TDruxZ8tozW8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKpjJ6ZJSD3l76fC4DaZ5moDrfqENk5DrC3V5m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVryaFeSx9Ipmsmn5UNXwMOBC9HZqnM-6Io7MO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532681755, "text": "Thank you for sharing your review of our company!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

He came out and spent a lot of time going over all the details when diagnosing my AC and thermostat which got waxed by a lightning storm 2 nights ago. Not knowing much at all about electrical and AC, he had every opportunity to \"create\" broken parts , etc. Nope,  not Corey and Autumn Air. I arm impressed with their work, knowledge, professionalism and honesty. Prices are most fair and they come out when they say they will come out.  Thanks to Corey, we now have AC again less than 36 hours after going down. Oh, and their preventive maintenance plan? Heck, you better jump  all over that, $10 a month auto draft to come out 4x yearly and clean and do PM check is unbeatable. Then when you join, no diagnostic charges when you  call them out, but wait, there's more ! You get a discount on all service  after you sign up !\nReally, $120 a year for the PM plan  ?? i thought he misquoted so I jumped on it but its for real ! Great service, great guy. You rock Corey !

I heard Autumn advertising on WDJC and thought I would check them out. Their monthly maintenance program is very reasonably priced and I even quizzed them on how much a capacitor replacement would run...much more reasonable! So I made the switch and scheduled my first maintenance visit...next day I might add and not in 6 weeks like the other.

After about 10 minutes, he called me back saying that they had a cancellation and a tech could be. at the house in about an hour.
