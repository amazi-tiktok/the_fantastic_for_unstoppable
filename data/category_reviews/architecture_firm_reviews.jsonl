I paid them a deposit of $250. As of today, the work has not been delivered. It was promised 10 days after payment. As of today, they are 100 days past due. I posted an honest review on their Facebook page, starting off by saying I hoped I could change it to a positive review in the near future. They changed their Facebook template to not allow reviews so mine could no longer be seen. They always say they are working on my plan and they will have something in a few days. Then I don't hear from them and nothing is ever delivered. Their Facebook page has photos they post- and therefore imply that the work depicted is their own. Through reverse photo look up I found photos they had \"lifted\" from other sites and I contacted the owners. Indeed they did not have permission to use the photos and it was not their work. When I tagged the owners in the misused photos they were promptly deleted from the Elaine Roberts drafters Facebook page. One of the owners of the business from which they had plagiarized the photos of others' work, did know Jimmy Parker - one of the owners of Elaine Roberts Drafters. He told me specifics of how the owner (Jimmy) of Elaine Roberts Drafters worked for him previously and had stolen from him, and described him as one of the biggest con-men he has encountered. Perhaps occasionally they deliver a product enough to keep up an image, I don't know, but after my own experience and what I heard from Jimmy Parker's previous employer, I sure wouldn't trust him with my money again!\n\nAlso look at their other reviews. Jimmy and Christy Parker are the husband/wife team that \u201cown/operate\u2019 this business they call Elaine Roberts Drafting and Design. (These are their respective middle names.)
