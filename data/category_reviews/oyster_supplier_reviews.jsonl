Access was easy and the place was very clean and surprisingly no smell of the oysters and dead fish like so many others. Clearly, I was at a processing plant and not a retail outlet. But, everything was handled like a retail store other than I was given a gallon/5 lbs. of oysters shucked TODAY (12-23-20) with a Sell-By date of Jan. 8. I could only get fresher oysters at an oyster bar where they shuck them when I order. As I was about to leave, a guy on a fork lift drove up and asked if I had been helped. I recoginized him from their web site. He was a VP and son of the owner. I look forward to many oysters in the future from R&A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bcebceab71487:0x8a503f81cd77db42"}
