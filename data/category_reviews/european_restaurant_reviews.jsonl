We had a bad experience and hadn't been back. Total transparency: most of the food was pretty good. It's the environment, employees, and lack of customer service that will prevent us from returning for probably another 4 years, if ever.\n\nThe hostess had her mask below her nose the *entire* visit. Our server and at least one other server, also had their masks below their nose most of the time we were there. However admittedly, our server did occasionally pull his up.\n\nWe had to ask for refills, napkins, and our check, as those things were not provided or offered intuitively.\n\nLastly, our sever rang up our order wrong. I ordered a hamburger slider/garden bar combo meal for $12.99 and he rung it up separately, $9.99 for the garden bar and $4.99 for the hamburger sliders.\nWhen I pointed it out (after he'd rung us out, my husband was paying...), he said he'd tell his manager and she'd come handle it.\nInstead he came back with $2 and said his manager said the difference is $2 so here we go.\n\nThe difference was actually $2.18 and let's be real, $0.18 doesn't matter right? I obviously don't NEED 18 cents.\nHowever, the principle of the matter: if a manager is going to ROUND something out in order to avoid the complication of re-ringing things up and refunding money to our card... fine. But don't do it in YOUR favor. Give me $2 and a quarter?\n\nIt just got under my skin... Ruby Tuesday does have to work a little harder than most places because they're fighting off several negative experiences by myself and my husband, even before me.... so they're walking a tighter rope.\n\nBut we won't be back anytime soon. Sadly, because I do really enjoy the salad bar.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxOYgdr8GMFItlZ7RIydWfx3jZHUEE207cdEVU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkD6NoRL_nD3hrKvyW8nk02itJdT69YvVYtnra=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPN-axg-mL9KV1mbz0E06O1vUUWBzpCW3JHGsi=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdWQfzo6clSSsJkONmCSaYwDz52WwXy5UHjVuT=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzjjD-wqPluuGe4_11a81Ff470H4OYqSRsL0y4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ded187d78d5bd:0x5c2b1fa8a24c9046"}

I looked at the check and the total was $13.21, I got a quarter and put it on top of the bill's. She came back, look to see how much the ticket was then counted the money. This is when she mumbled under her breath \"No tip? I guess I work for free.\"  And without stopping to think I said, \"I guess you do when you are rude as hell to everyone at our table.
