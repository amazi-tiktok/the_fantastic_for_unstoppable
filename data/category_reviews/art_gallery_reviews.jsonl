Nothing held back; Stacy is invested in her students having as much success as possible in the process. She was accommodating to my flight schedule and carry-on restrictions and worked with me on the things I could not bring on the plane. The class was fun and I got to meet and make new friends with a great bunch of clay folk. And, I made a crazy octopus bowl to boot!\n\nLater in the summer, I was able to take another class, Slip Trailing, on my way to a work seminar. This was a tremendous compliment to the octopus work, and will have applications in a lot of my other work. It adds a dimension (literally) that is not available through glaze or underglaze. She was detailed enough in the chemistry that I was hooked, but not so much that the class was lost. The demos and slip play go a super long way in understanding the intricasies of the process.\n\nNow to the area. Alabama is just lovely! The hot sticky weather that they were having was perfect for my cold northern blood. The flora in Alabama is completely different to mine, and I enjoyed driving around to take it all in. The Mills are an amazing space dedicated to the arts and I could have spent days wandering the booths. And!! Anyone visiting Stacy who is gluten free or paleo; I found the most delightful bakery and eatery. Their dedicated gluten free facility has some of the best stuff, and that includes BEFORE my diagnosis. Try the jalapeno cheddar scones at Mason Dixon Bakery, you\u2019ll never want to leave.\n\nSo seriously, if the opportunity comes to have class with Stacy and S.P.Morgan Studios, take it; you will have no regrets.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIe6G8pfkAKvVmaeVWdTqCVFZ-KmMOg_B6chwA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv4tW9XFJaxXLyvtizsXfGb3AaEk10zOiKZ9RQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5voVbbuE5ouJtKV0l6OBBXkc-PMB3pbehYnDF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbcca324b2d:0x6d862a64a6cb230d"}

I am disappointed that there are not more customers people buying to support the artists but the exposure is awesome and we enjoyed networking with other artists and the art community. The only people who bought our art we're from out of town. Get out there Huntsville and support the arts better! Bobby is a killer hairstylist and the food is awesome. Great place to take kids if your looking for something to do in Huntsville.\nLowe Mill is a great place and a must see!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRF9miik0FhxT2-9lghCZo38BofzUBna13alf1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3gv2ypguCqJZ3kkIKOIdvzwDbG9NBuSZzAm3l=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrtEVwhOp1GQseyG9dKcJMUbTqi4fMHCY3m744=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNA-vnwGOs0ucVxu_GvkyW4p0YEzNDiTWH6pGQN=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlzmpNn8m-5cRUZgaTkfaiaqMtNEZHBar9SDzJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-weTs31XQg0VP63Opi0GN5bEWujRMvz5WrRNk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh4Ss1vkh86XCaqZ0iNBWcNYcaKXnkMgrHQJOl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZsPMdurR-l2BPHH8ng0ykVJKwacC8B8XlhT_K=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ6CsOZJ8yhOeiYcQyip5CdWae1uFvHWvswWFd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlithD9-syeYEX0fgCXRlbos-2SfwrHpavbNgV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmiAcVRg7ko1dxTpZ6WG9MXsW6v38Si1_thrF2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPj9MRq54NswwoiB-AnCk1PZSke8W8eAZYTdoqH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2Yxwqbfm2z14wvqXk7kbrifqXsAalwgZRI6XO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2m2kXBuXQIBScSvjvQ3-tW0CazG2GiA9Zav8z=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQWzpA6D59H4Ieku-em0hIIPp92pYrzsOSPRgs=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxX655pYXNC4ztzzm1iR4cdHj4B5NyCqBPa0VI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOunfdk_C8YnbEoHoVHQwyUj5jGW_i968_3X1vZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHt1HF_7LBh4faeUj0yIP83yvgcYDLDnYfgAUS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpYpPmclaK7NdDEsqKllJ80A1l4K-MahMVQSrU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEQwrfnyqqWZaww7g7g-6kZBbYiqo7VMgTPKZM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvOcQEojaNM9eI6yUyOeLlcQB8lxjgdJd809rA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDva-7s1TgF4o8WfIK5CIbsxcArmrJ0e6CMWfm=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZiCVcl5UVbCgzLpbKo_7Sq4M7PbpgsWyMIGfV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqSkMlvaQrqaBAQrBply798vkULIwQ6Wspr2QH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9io6VsAkaJFXsHW0we_lHCGBELsFJUetpGj3g=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuwTRQFH2O_cFm9HOKW2xM9rpgI8E6H8lYjWjm=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv1USE80ztbLtr_wrnJIPgGffOBpUwBZ75XNgI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQFrmPvqJijqsG5t9kMYbpelv_jvTHuTSlHsla=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOkdmlN3wOOfKEbAk9TadeENklLQwDKKzwoinO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPl_UIcQrxK7n0xc8bHQOnt6bZLeqTa5VcsNsn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPezmCifKToggOmJApEpPM7C3R59K8ogVxicFpl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXwxjkamJQV6s87Od2CjBsLIlSR3Y8e9oWQLCF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNwL9DeHobBH_n_qZ3k-_iQj66JAJbpqoox677=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6R5xon5jvL3hIrNGF-3bE0ybTeU3PuqFDiiwy=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN27fpl7z6AwrsV4gAVPXGKIsp0uIGPRfvq0bLD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbcc84ca9cb:0xdc939ac21cd9db2f"}

After visiting several times I've noticed that many of the studios appear to be locked up with no artists in sight, even on a Saturday when most people are able to spend time enjoying the art. Thus, it lacked the bustling art community/marketplace feel that you would expect visiting such a large fine arts venue. Where are the artists? That however is not the fault of Lowe Mill. It's the fault of the artists who must not be starving, lol. The atmosphere doesn't feel friendly, even the woman sitting in the office is unapproachable. Why do people think art and snobbery are interchangeable? Anyway, the main reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the stairwell in the Flying Monkey had such a bad urine smell. It's extremely off putting and screamed trashy for that section of the mill. My 10 year old asked what the smell was. We should have gone to the elevator so that I didn't have to explain why people pee in stairwells.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbcc84ca9cb:0xdc939ac21cd9db2f"}
