I could have gotten a MUCH better deal from another dealer but I didn't want to drive over an hour if I needed parts. For this reason I was willing to overlook the salesman who had ZERO knowledge of tractors, had no idea what a flail mower was and couldn't tell me what features would justify the expense of one implement over the other. I was willing to ignore  the random mechanic who wandered onto the sales floor trying to talk me out of the machine I wanted even though he had no understanding of my needs. I also endured the pain of dealing with the rude and unwelcoming finance manager who had the personality of a shoe. All of this because of the promise of a good service department and the full coverage warranty through Kubota and KTAC which is supposed to cover EVERYTHING on the tractor. Fast forward a few months and it's time for a small part that broke. I went right to HMTC service dept only to find out that not only is the part not covered, but they don't even have the part in stock and will take a month to come in. Ok, chalk it up to bad luck. Another month or so later I head to HMTC again for simple parts and they have none in stock. This happened a total of 4 times and I finally give up. The management here is out of touch with the market and their customers. They refuse to hire competent, qualified employees. Even the lady and the front door acts like you're interrupting her day when you walk through the door. Never again will I do business with or recommend anyone to HMTC.
