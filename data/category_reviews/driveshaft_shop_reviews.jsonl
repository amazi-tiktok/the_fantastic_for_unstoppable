Dropped off on 2/11. Initially returned even worse on 2/26 (left car to be fixed) and picked up on 3/1)\n2) Transmission cooler was damaged by mechanic in the process of fixing a dripping leak in the O ring/transmission line  (initial problem). Mechanic CLAMIED that the damage to the transmission cooler WAS the cause of the initial problem (dripping leak in transmission line).\n3) Husband wanted to fix the transmission cooler himself. Mechanic said that there was a small leak in the cooler. Picture below tells a different story. Leak went from a few drops every few minutes to gushing all over the engine with the entire fluid contents of the transmission basin on the ground within a minute.\n4) Had to pay for full price for parts/labor for their \"mistake\" to my transmission cooler  (that is no longer manufactured) on top of the parts/cost to fix the initial problem.\n5) Mechanic took my orange funnel from my engine and left trash in my engine.\n6) Mechanic also damaged my engine somehow. The engine made a horrible high pitched noise when I turned on my car (3/2) this morning to go to work.\n\nI NOW have to take the car back to this mechanic so they can AGAIN fix the damage THEY have caused to my vehicle. Unacceptable as my husband has known the owner for 20+ years and the company he works for takes their company vehicles here for maintenance and repair. Disappointing.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAdYQ4VCpvD5kECFedT0x1dWNxnl6zEhSeGro1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88929306ae9054ef:0x4f85e49c1df5eff0"}

I got there and picked it up before I had to rush to work because of the Inconvenience. Got to work and actually popped the hood to see what has been done and the first thing I notice is a bolt holding the radiator is missing along with three other bolts to hold other various things in the front down. Further investigations leads me to find no COOLANT in the reservoir.

Called the next week and was told it was back togeather and was chucked up doing a balancing check and they would call when done. No call. Finally i went and retrived the driveshaft. Nothing had been done. No new parts. No tooling marks indicating any work whatsoever had been done.  Six weeks they had the drive shaft. A lot of grief for what?
