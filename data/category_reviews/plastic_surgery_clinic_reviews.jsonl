Maybe that's my only option...but the scars were VERY visible no matter how hard she tried to convince me they weren't. I understand bc of my anatomy, I may have limited options, but we said from the beginning, anchor scars were a deal breaker. His portfolio was unimpressive, and a lot of women's breasts looked better to me and my husband in the before pics than the afters.\n\nI wouldn't hire a plastic surgeon for their personality, and this one was supposed to be a \"perfectionist,\" but the way he judged me the entire time, and pretty much made me feel incredibly unattractive and stupid made me want to leave his office as fast as possible.

I first went to him in 2013 for a surgical procedure. The results I got from Dr. Howard were simply amazing and gave me years of beauty and personal confidence and happiness. I know that I cannot attribute those results to anything but to the skill of Dr. Howard's hands. I went back to him for the same procedure two weeks ago and I could not not be happier with the results. I hesitated about my timing, but from the very first call into his office, I felt confident about my decision to come back to Dr. Howard. The magic of his hands is there as it was in 2013.

From the beginning they worked me in super quickly! I made an appointment, and was in for my surgery within two weeks. I urge patients not to be frustrated by wait times. There are days your visit will be very quick, an other times you will wait. The wait just means he is in a procedure (one can not always control surrgical length) or he is spending ample time with another patient. You will get the same courtesy. All staff members have been top notch in their skill and customer service. Dr Rousso made my nose look completely natural again after a previous surgeon did NOT. I highly recommend a surgeon such as Dr Rousso if you plan on a rhinoplasty. You want someone that does facial work and not body work. I also want to add that he recommends an overnight stay at a hotel so you can be checked by his protege in the evening. I was not happy about this at first, but I promise it is well worth it in the end. Im so glad I stayed and Dr Richards was able to check my progress. I also appreciated the help from the sitter.

The doctor just gave me instructions for after my husband got home.

Read it.\" No explanation of any kind just a rude answer of \"we gave you paperword, read it\" I had read the paperword before I talked with the nurse but didn't understand what it said so that is why I called to get someone to explain to me what the medical terms in the paperwork meant, but no one would talk with me. I called the patient advocate twice. The first time I called I was told the patient advocate was not in. The second time I called I had to leave a message and asked that someone call me back, but no one ever called me. We still don't know what the doctors at Saint Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham found out about my husband. I felt the people especially the nurses were rude and would not talk with me. We asked the ambulance to take my husband to Saint Vincent's hospital, because we were told it was a good place to go for heart patients. But the way we were treated we will never go back to that hospital again. If you like being ignored and treated rudely that is the place to go. If you want kindness and concern when someone in your family is sick, find another hospital.
