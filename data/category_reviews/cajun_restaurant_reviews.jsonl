Having eaten in New Orleans more times than I can remember, I would say the chef has toned down the food to cater to a broader (i.e., non-New Orleans) audience. The result is less than stellar. Second, the prices are way over the top. $15 for a simple pasta dish with only a couple of crawfish in the sauce is beyond the pale.

The family that runs it is really nice, too.  The menu is pretty small but they seem to put effort into everything they sell.  Case in point, the roast beef is tender and the gravy homemade.  That same gravy graces the Glory Fries, and they are a savory alternative to sad regular fries.  Speaking of which, the fries here are not \u201cregular\u201d at all!  They are some sort of unusual ribbon cut that\u2019s folded almost in half.  It\u2019s a design that maximizes the outer crunch while preserving the interior\u2019s soft creamy center and holy cow why isn\u2019t everyone making fries this way!?  There are a couple of seasonings you can add to them; I sampled the Cajun one and it\u2019s slightly spicy, but my favorite will always be the Glory Fries since cheese plus gravy = heaven.\n\nThe bread for the po-boys is excellent quality as well.  Too often down here I\u2019ve eaten po-boys where the bread is either incredibly chewy to the point it\u2019s almost inedible, or so heavily toasted it dissolves into crumbs on the first bite.  But not this.  It\u2019s tender on the inside and has just the right light crispness on the exterior.\n\nI\u2019ve also had a cup of the gumbo and it really is some of the best I\u2019ve had anywhere, with several good shrimp and sausage bits in it, plus plenty of rice and a nice red pepper kick that made the spiciest thing I\u2019ve found on the menu so far.\n\nAt the time my family and I dined in, they were testing something in place of the regular coleslaw, that they were calling Swamp Slaw.  It was white corn with tomatoes, cucumbers and a homemade ranch dressing, with light seasoning.  It\u2019s not something I\u2019d want but my family member who tried it absolutely raved about it, since it was so flavorful and out of the ordinary.  She also had onion rings instead of fries and they were a thumbs up from everyone, too.  The onions were sweet and the batter was crisp and crunchy without being messy.\n\nThe other diner in our group had the spicy sausage po-boy and he enjoyed it, but complained that it was not the least bit spicy even by our bland local standards.\n\nWe\u2019ve also had a chance to try the beignets and they are very good, too.  They\u2019re not nearly as big as some of the ones I\u2019ve had elsewhere here or in New Orleans but they are cooked just right, with a fluffy interior and crisp exterior, and of course plenty of powdered sugar.  A fitting end to an excellent meal.\n\nOverall, a really good experience.  It\u2019s not a big place, and it\u2019s definitely out of the way but worth seeking out.  If there\u2019s one complaint to lodge, it\u2019s the lack of a fountain drink dispenser; they only offer bottles of Coke products and Gold Peak tea, which is not ideal.  Still, that\u2019s a minor quibble for what is an otherwise really, really good authentic New Orleans-style po-boy.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572789786636, "text": "Thank you very much for all of your honesty we greatly appreciate it.

I live in Vestavia so it is a little off the beaten path from Southside or Over the Mountain, but is worth the trip if you're ever driving out to Tuscaloosa or just in Bessemer.\n\nThe service is very slow, but that is part of the experience, so be prepared.  So why 5 stars???  The food is why you should try this place out.  Decor, service, and location (although new location by Bessemer Railroad Museum is night and day better than Watermark Place) aren't special, but the value of the food itself mitigates all the other factors and still earns it a 5 in my book.\n\nI recommend the food prepared blackened or sauteed.  Every entree and side is just a step above what I would expect for the price point.  For instance, the black eyed peas are my favorite side and about 2 or 3 stars better than what you would get at a meat and 3.  The downside is that they will raise your standards, and most other places offerings will seem sub-par going forward.\n\nThe deserts are all excellent, but I recommend the bread pudding with whiskey sauce above all others.  They have a wide variety of options on the menu but not be in stock so be prepared 3 several choices.  The good thing is all the food is delicious.\n\nMake it an experience, or just order take out.

Upon our arrival, the teenage greeter, who was sitting at the entrance breastfeeding her baby says, \"Dine in or carry out\".  We said dine in.  She responds by saying, \"It's too late, you have to carry out.\"  Well, why give us that option?  She goes on to say, \"You can take the menu's into the hall and someone will come to take your order.\"  During our wait, we watched as another unsatisfied customer requested assistance.  When the employees, refused to help her, she vowed, \"I'll never come back here.\"  We were enjoying one another's company when we realized that about 10 minutes had passed and no one had come to take our order.  So, we entered the main dinning room again to be told someone will be out shortly.  When we mentioned we'd been waiting for over 10 minutes for someone, they decided to take our order.  All of the people we encountered from the greeter to the cashier seemed angry that we were there and irritated by our presence.  So, I asked to speak with the owner.  I spoke with the HUSBAND and he apologized and promised to try to do better.  End of story, so we thought.  The WIFE comes into the hallway where we were waiting and told us, since you have a problem watching my daughter breastfeed her child then DON'T COME BACK.  Of course, I responded by saying, \"Absolutely no problem!\"  At that point, we were skeptical about eating the food they were preparing for us.  So, we asked for a refund.  The teenage immature breastfeeding mom starts screaming and says, \"Mom, come out and give them they refund cause I can't do it.  ima about to go off. Give them they money back cause they need the money more than we do.\"  Now, this CHILD is going off and the owner, the mother, the wife, screams, someone CALL THE POLICE!  Really, your child is the instigator, the problem.  I guess she thought that was going to scare us.  But we patient waited on our refund.  As we waited, the other waitresses stood nearby making comments like, \"I mean, it's ok, I can take the food home.  It's no problem.  The food will be eaten.\"  All of this was so unprofessional and there is obviously no concern for customer service at this place.  #nomoreBotangs", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888de2821b4a955:0xc8dd41cb38cef116"}

I'm glad cause if I had paid for them the level of disappointment would have been overwhelming. They are the low quality frozen onion rings that has the very thin supposedly sliced onion that has no onion flavor that's breaded in breading that has no flavor! I also ordered the crawfish that's boil-in-bag with potatoes,  sausage,  and corn. I imagine it would have tasted alright if I could have eaten it! There was so much grease in the bag and on the food I was afraid to try it! I don't know if the grease came from the cheap sausage that was included or if they added margarine thinking that would add flavor. The corn literally had to be rung out with paper towels before it was edible!\nAll-in-all the jewel in this experience was the waitress Ashanti! Her patience and her professionalism spoke volumes!
