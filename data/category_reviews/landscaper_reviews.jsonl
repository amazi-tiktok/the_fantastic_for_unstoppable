I kept my mouth shut but I was definitely on guard after he said that. Next I wanted him to quote a wooden privacy fence around a pool. We came to an area that required a metal section of fence across my driveway.  He told me it wasn't an option to use anchor bolts on concrete for the posts.  As someone he has a fair amount of experience about anchoring I flat out told him it was if he did it correctly.  Once again he got very irate. Then he told me it would take $7000 to cover the 60' section of driveway.  I pointed out that the metal section across the driveway is the same width as the 20' wide pool I wanted to fence off - it does not require anywhere near 60' of fence to go across a 2-car wide driveway. He got mad again when I told him this - but, I mean it's just so obvious.  He stormed off, saying he and I weren't going to get along and I could find someone else. A frustrating waste of time and certainly did not inspire confidence in me that this contractor was competent.

They did a drainage project for me where I explicitly described the design I wanted and it incorporated solid PVC pipe.  On the day of the job, the workers showed up with corrugated pipe.  When I called the owner, he stated that PVC would be $800 more, so feeling like I didn't want to start over with another contractor, I told him to go ahead.  Then I found out that a portion of the water to be drained to the street running from the downspout  was going through perforated corrugated pipe (pipe with holes).  They assured me that the water would be moving and would not leak out into already saturated ground (yeah, right).  Then I came home to find that the grate to catch water coming off the sidewalk was about 1 and a half to 2 inches away from the sidewalk, requiring the water to run over dirt before entering the grate.  The owner tried to tell me that it would be no problem and the bare dirt would not erode despite water constantly running over it.  I insisted that concrete be put between the sidewalk and grate to keep the water from washing out the dirt.  When I came home, I found they had used a type of caulk between the grate and the sidewalk, and had done a messy job of it, I don't know if that much caulk will ever cure.  After two days it is still soft.  Additionally, where they cut through the curb, the re-concreting was extremely poorly done.  It looked like they didn't even use a trowel, much less a curbing tool.  It looked like they basically packed the concrete on with their fingers and left it.  Part of the contract called for doing a brick border along the sidewalk.  After I paid them for the portion of the contract for the drainage, they informed me that they were waking away from the contract and that I needed to find someone else to do the edging.  The pity is, the subcontractor they had lined up to do the masonry work actually sounded very competent.  Bottom line, this is a company that, in my opinion, cut corners at every opportunity, poorly designed the project, provided shoddy workmanship, and then walked away with nearly half of the contracted work unperformed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626519de7ef85b:0x4b6cae1b92594858"}

I contracted with them to do drainage work, a sprinkler system and landscape lighting.\n\nI was told this would take 3 weeks to complete, with each phase occurring on consecutive weeks. The project as a whole took almost 12 weeks to complete, and this was only because I hounded them with calls multiple times per week.\n\nThe drainage work was the first part, it seemed to be fine, though the French drain was not placed the complete length that was discussed originally. Also the fingers of river rich were put in to stop erosion, but almost no grass seed was put in afterwards, so nothing but weeds grew in between the river rock.\n\nThe second piece was the sprinkler system. This was put in during a day, but the ground was not backfilled properly and they needed to come back out to fix it. We were told that they would put down grass seed after the lighting job was completed. The lighting work was not completed for another 8 weeks, and there wasn\u2019t any seed put down afterwards. They were also supposed to aerate and oversees the lawn, but since they could not get their mower into our backyard, they told us they would come back with a smaller mower to pull the aerator later. This never happened.\n\nI had to call them 2-3 times a week for 8 weeks to get them to complete the lighting. Part of it was landscape lighting, the other portion was putting in a fan and spotlight in/on our screened patio. The wiring was placed so shallow, that it came out of the ground within a week and they had to come back to fix. The light and fan was supposed to be put in by an electrician, but was just put in by the owner and his friend. They put a cheap conduit over the electrical wire that didn\u2019t even cover the wire.  They sent an electrician out to fix the wiring, but he just rigged another kind of conduit on the bare wire to cover it up.  The uplighting for the trees was sold to us at $65 a light. I just found the lights online for $45 for a 4-pack of lights.\n\nWe just gave up with this company and figured we would just be stuck with this work. Over the last year, I kept burying and covering up the wire as it came out of the ground and have been trying to repair the grass in the area where they did sprinkler and drainage work. We are still fighting massive weeds from the lack of follow through on planting grass after their work was completed.\n\nI am writing this review today after I just finished replacing 3 lights that stopped working and half of the wiring that was put in for the landscape lights. Turns out they believe that wire nuts are not necessary and you only need to tape wires together with electrical tape before putting it in the ground.\n\nIf you are looking for a company to do landscaping work for you, stay very far away from this company.

We wanted to put in a curved edge patio and he came out and measured the land, staked out the space and figured out what would work best. Our schedules didn't align at first but we made it work once we figured out a workable timeline. He came back a few more times and we discussed color of the concrete, size, dimensions, drainage, and a bunch of other details. He was patient and hear do us out, and you could tell he was excited about the project.\n\nWhen the crew showed up they were fast, professional, and methodical. They know their craft. They worked from 6am to 7pm some days, going over the details, re-laying sod, cleaning up spills or little messes (nothing major just normal stuff from the construction), and generally just making the backyard look good again.\n\nAnd the finished product is exactly what we wanted! Josh kept telling us to trust him, he had a plan, he was going to pour some creativity into our project and we wouldn't be disappointed. And he was right! Our once ugly backyard patio space now looks like something out of a magazine! The form is beautiful, it makes our yard flow, and it is just a fantastic job. I HIGHLY recommend these guys.

They are an exceptional concrete contracting company that most definitely puts the customer first. They went way out of their way to ensure they had a satisfied customer with our project and believe me, we were not an easy customer to please. They had to continuously answer questions and listen to our concerns but did so with nothing but professionalism. They take pride in their work and have been very professional throughout the entire process!\n\nWe went with the stamped concrete design with colors to blend well with our brick. We were unsure of the colors and how they would look next to the brick on our house, but with their experience and knowledge they were able to give us what we wanted. The colors are as close to perfect as you can get!\n\nWe've never known anyone personally that had a stamped concrete patio or have ever viewed a stamped concrete patio of this design, other than in pictures, so fully understanding the process and the amount of work it takes to build a patio, such as this, was beyond our full comprehension. It takes a lot of work, skill and somewhat of an artistic eye along with exceptional pride to produce a nice product. Foxcrete did just that!\n\nThe patio is designed with the appeal of a paver patio, but without stones that will move. The brick lined edge comes down the side walls of the patio giving it a realistic appearance of brick pavers. The colors are a mixture of browns and tans, with the brick edge being a darker color than the inner area of the patio giving it a distinct framed look. We love this design and the colors!\n\nThank you, Josh and Foxcrete Construction Group, for doing such a fantastic job on this patio!

Every week they neglect weed eating the fence lines as they are required to do, as well as consistently cut the lawns at an extremely low height setting on the mowers. To the point that the soil is seen and dry spots are created. We pay a separate lawn service company to keep the weed and feed services, as well as aerating the soil, and they ruin all the work we have invested in having a healthy lawn. Upon contacting the manager of the lawn crews, he always gives the excuse that the yard is uneven, or that he will speak with the team leader of the crew that cuts the area our home is located in. The HOA has yet to take action to correct things, nor has this company done any thing to correct the issues.

I told her our yard looks horrible since it has not been cut since May 2nd and I know when they are there because of the camera. I then asked when they were going to be coming out and she said the earliest would be this Wednesday, since they were done for whichthe week. That  would have made it nearly a month which is totally unexceptable. She then told me that they have long standing customers that have to be taken care of and I responded I am a paying customer as well and she said all their customers need to be taken care of. The owner sent me a message Saturday stating the entire yard would be taken care of Tuesday. It is sad when you pay someone to do a job and it is half done or not at all. Pretty much after each time they cut our lawn I would have to call because they didn't weed eat the fence line or cut the easement as agreed upon. I will not ever recommend them or use them again.

By 1:44 PM, we received another ring at the doorbell and the service technician was already gone, I could see everything the technician did while on our property, Spoiler alert nothing was done. When I got home, there was a service sheet listing all the services that have been performed during our visit that day. They claim they did an application and an evaluation of the yard. I have no idea how a Service technician was able to perform an entire application on our front and back yard in 8 minutes.  MAKE SURE you have video if you were going to get the service. The rep who assisted us with setting up the plan stated if we had issues during our service to reach out to her, when we did, she ignored our text message. We\u2019ve canceled our service and we will not return. If you ruin your first impression, you do not get a second chance. I\u2019m also filling a complaint with the BBB, if I do not receive a refund as promised.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553875454717, "text": "Amanda, , we are sorry to see that you had a less than satisfactory experience.

I had gotten a call from my TruGreen rep Jonathan about setting up service.  We had service from TruGreen 2 years ago and stopped mostly because we didn't feel that the service was worth what we were paying.  We would get call around 9 AM for same day services so we hardly ever got our backyard treated, etc.  Also could never get ahold of a person at the Huntsville Office to talk about our service.  Well 2 weeks ago we decided to sign up again.  We signed up for the yearly service and I also asked about getting aeration set up for the lawn. So here we are 2 weeks later and we were told it would be on a Thursday and Friday of the week after we signed up.  Thursday rolled around and it was raining so of course they wouldn't be out.  I called Jonathan (no VM) so I texted him to find out that they would be out on that Friday.  Friday came and went without any service.  Texted Jonathan and was told it would be today (Monday).  So it's Monday and I texted Jonathan to find out when so I can unlock our back gate, etc and was told to go to the app to find out when they would be out. There is no place on the app to check this so I started a chat with an \"agent\" only to be told to talk to my representative on when they would be out.  In the mean time we have had two lawn applications in a matter of a week.  I'm beyond frustrated with True Green and will never recommend them for my friends and family.

I had TruGreen in 2018 and at the end of the year decided to end service. There were multiple times they didn\u2019t show up and I had to call and complain.  And at no point in that year was my back yard treated and it was overcome with weeds. I didn\u2019t think I should have to chase down a service I was paying for. At the beginning of October a sales rep came by and I decided after speaking with him to give it another shot. He seemed horrified by the difference between my front and back yards. He gave me his cell phone number as a personal guarantee that he would handle any issues of the person not coming out. Because of the time of year it was he told me that I would be services every 6-8 weeks. Which, if you\u2019re any good at math, would tell you that at MOST I *may* have two treatments before the end of the year. On October 24th I texted him and said that there must be some confusion because I had already been charged twice, and when looking on the website it appeared I was going to have another one within the next two weeks. He told me he would credit me one of the services I had received and push back my next service. He was going to follow up with me the next day. On November 5th I reached out to him again, I had not received a follow up and already had a pending charge for another treatment. No response. November 6th I texted again, this time he said he was going to get it resolved and a credit issued. I should have that credit within three business days. On November 15th I had still not received that credit, and a technician showed up at my house to treat. I sent my sales rep another text. At this point I had already been billed 109.87 in a month and a half, when I should have been charged less than 80 through the end of the year. I explained what I had been billed, the lack of credits I received after being told it was coming, and the frustration I felt for being signed up for tree and shrub service that I didn\u2019t ask for and didn\u2019t need. I explained I expected a refund of 79.92 for the two treatments that I should have never received, and that I would like to cancel my service. He responded with a \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d. On November 20th I sent a follow up text to be sure it was handled. The sales rep has red the text but not responded. It is November 23rd and there is no refund to my account, I have no trust in TruGreen that this will be handled in a professional manner.

This includes sprinklers front and back, outdoor lighting around the backyard, sod front and back, gravel on one side of the house, bushes, straw beds, a privacy hedge, and a tree in the front yard.\n\nBefore they did sod, they \u201cgraded\u201d the yard. It was a horrible mud hole until they came. Our yard has a bad erosion problem from the slope of our yard. I asked them to fill in the low spots with some dirt before they laid sod so the yard would be more level and the water wouldn\u2019t pool. The nice man in charge agreed.\n\nWhen they were done, the yard looked amazing. Truly beautiful. However, after a few weeks, it was apparent that they had not filled in the low spots before they laid sod. A few spots were constant puddles, and the sod in those spots was getting torn up because it wasn\u2019t taking to the mud.\n\nWe contacted DC, and they replied straight away that they would fix the problem. They came out, picked up the sod, filled in the low spots with dirt, and then covered them back up with fresh sod. He even offered to replace the bushes in our backyard because our dogs have killed them with urine. I declined because it wasn\u2019t their fault. We\u2019ve had no problems ever since.\n\nOne of our sprinklers has had problems a few times, and so have our backyard lights. Each time, they have shown up promptly to fix the problem with no hassle.\n\nThe one thing I would ask is that they start calling ahead or knocking on people\u2019s front doors before they randomly show back up in people\u2019s backyards for a service call. My wife and I were naked in our living room one day and got quite the shock when we looked out the window to see some strange men in DC Lawn shirts. They\u2019ve surprised us multiple times actually.

This never happened with any previous contractor. In the past, if it rained, other guys just wouldn't show up -- no communication. DC rescheduled with me for just a couple of days later -- and then showed up a day early. Their installation team, led by Bobby Faust, was knowledgable, and they got in and out quickly. They cleaned up their mess when they left. A week later, Bobby even came back to check on the work.\n\nYou can do a lot worse than to hire DC Lawn and Landscape, but I'm not sure you can do any better.

This review is coming at the end of the only season where I used Superior. Throughout the year I wasn't impressed with the invasive weeds that continued to sprawl in the back yard. Normally I was not home when the service was rendered, but one time I stop the person doing the application. He was rather dismissive and said they would get taken care in the future weed control applications. I am not a professional lawn person(hence the reason I pay them)so I had to assume he was telling the truth.\n\nToday, I was home when he came to do the final application. The truck was out front for less than 10 minutes. I have a reasonable sized lawn, front and back and a very difficult gate latch to contend with. There is a zero percent chance that he would have been able to disembark the truck, prep his application material, mange the gate, do a proper back yard treatment, latch the finicky gate latch, do the front and tag my door in that amount of time.  Suddenly then it clicked, this is likely why the back looks terrible - other than the one time I was here with the gate open, the work has never actually been done. (Included below crab grass photos taken today - after $432 in applications you should not see an increase in the amount of weeds - these patches are 2x what they were in the spring.)\n\nIt is evident that Superior does not instill in their employees a sense of pride in their work. I've had the same person so all the applications and a reputable business would develop a culture of doing the right thing. The application person should be invested enough to actually correct the problems a customer and ask for support if needed. Clearly this is not the case with Superior. The operations manager had the approach of blaming me for not bringing it to their attention at an earlier time and after consideration, I believe he couldn't be more wrong. If the applications aren't effective, his employee should be responsible and proactive enough to address this internally and find a solution for the customer.  Obviously these are not priorities for their organization.\n\nCaveat emptor.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy4-LTuRrGXDNNTQpAp8cJeGNZM6R6wv4XCW6a=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMho-gmsg-5oiMvEhcU7dZYQQf60m_tBAUnM0Gp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88882b00ada4e425:0xca3738802127df8b"}

They showed up late (without calling) to give me an estimate, and then showed up unannounced the day they came to work. But then things took a surprising turn..\n>   They were hired to fell one tree and heavily trim the lower branches of another. To save money and to give me a project involving strenuous exercise, they were not required to do any cleanup work. When they asked about my cleanup plans, I mentioned using my ATV trailer to move the debris to the street for pickup by the city. At their suggestion I moved the trailer into the work area. Suddenly the logs and branches magically found their way onto the trailer until it was full, with the remainder piled neatly nearby. Despite not being paid for it, they worked hard to minimize the cleanup work remaining for me, a fat 74 year old retired soldier.\n>  It was also interesting and entertaining to watch their tree climber work. He knew exactly where and how to make cuts to have the pieces fall right where he wanted them. And while 20+ feet up into the tree being trimmed, he asked me over and over what else I wanted cut. He never suggested being done until I was satisfied.\n>   Finally, when the work was done, they did a last minute walk-around to check for any tools left behind, and to pick up more debris so I wouldn't have to.\n>   The team's work (and work ethics) more than made up for the early communications problems.

I find this highly unacceptable. When i called these people last year, the owner Jacob came out, whom i consider the 'money man.\"  i explained to him that i dont have a green thumb at all and need some kind of consultation regarding what i need to do to get my yard up to speed.  All he proceeds to do is write down how much everything is going to cost me without allowing someone who knows about horticulture to come out and discuss with me first about what would be the proper plants i need based on my unique environment.

Amanda at the office made the scheduling and transaction a breeze. Tahj and Dan started work promptly the day of the project and hammered out most of the clean out before lunch. After lunch Eric and Pedro joined the team and the entire crew finished the job. In 10 hours they had completely cleaned out and dug-up/removed the weeds and 12 over grown bushes from the front, back, and side beds, removed 5 stumps, cleaned out an over grown play area and had taken out 2 dying trees. By night fall, they had the yard mulched and ready for phase 2 - replanting in the spring. The following morning Tahj dropped by to mow the grass and edge the entire property, just as he had promised. You can tell Tahj gave a damn, and treated the place like his own. Eric brought the knowledge and had no problem answering my questions about plants and things while they worked. Pedro kept them honest, while Dan provided the laughs.

He was very friendly and was so thorough in his lawn application, being careful to really saturate any problem areas. He took about an hour to complete the service.

I've been retired for three years now so Kathy and I watch our money a little closer than before.  I went in one day to get a quote on having a flower box built in my front yard.  I was happy to find that the people on the inside were very knowledgeable and anxious to help.  Tommy Trimm came to my residence himself to quote on my project.  Tommy was also very knowledgeable and put me at ease with his excellent recommendations and suggestions on how to make this huge wooden box look good in my front yard! We agreed on a price and shook hands on that price.  Tommy's men were stretched pretty thin at the time so it took several weeks to work me in.  When his men showed up to start my project they knew exactly what to do.  The two man crew flew into work and within a few hours had my project completed.  Since to the completion of my project I've patronized Trimm Landscaping many time for topsoil for my new flower box and advice on which flowers to plant.  Whether your a seasoned Gardner or a novice like myself Trimm Landscaping is a great place to purchase garden products.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890ce3b7851a9d:0x496c59ce653df658"}

Hamilton Trimm came and evaluated the area and what needed to be done. Trimm's team came and within two days had transformed this unsightly common area into something totally different with beautiful plants and landscaping of the area.  Hamilton chose the different plants for both of our yards and did an outstanding job that made it less stressful for us in having to decide what to plant. With over 30 plants for each of our yards and with pine straw put down with new top soil Trimm's price was very reasonable. A visit to their facility in Trussville will be an experience in viewing hundreds of lovely plants. I would highly recommend Trimm Landscape if one is considering a home landscape change. As an added note over the winter my neighbor and I did not lose one plant to the cold which shows the care used by Trimm in preparing the ground for the plants.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890ce3b7851a9d:0x496c59ce653df658"}
