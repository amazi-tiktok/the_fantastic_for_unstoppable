He also let me know that the firm was always available should the matter get to the point that representation became necessary. When I had further questions as the situation progressed, I called back, but was unable to reach Thomas immediately, as he was in court that day. I left a message with their front desk,  and received a call back from Melvin later that day as Thomas was still in court. He listened intently and further advised me as what I needed to do, and even returned another call in regards to my issue. Both Thomas and Melvin were extremely helpful in what was to me new territory as I had never been in a situation like this before. They stood ready to assist any way they could to include retaining their services should the need arise. As a retired Marine with 26 years service I know professionalism when I see it. Hope I don't need to retain an attorney for this current situation but I have full confidence in them should that need arise.

I'm pretty sure that conversation should not have been discussed in front of a potential client. As I am sitting there explaining to Mr. Thomas why I am there seeking hes services he was more interested in picking the sores on his leg then paying any attention to anything i had to say, and while he was showing me the bruises from his recent jet ski accident all he could tell me was to seek an attorney immediately. I believe that's what I am here. What he ment was i needed a court appointed attorney because I could not afford him. So with Very unprofessional! My family has dealt with Powell Law firm for many years my aunt has know Mr. Thomas sence hes graduation year in 07. They have been wonderful people always willing to help with a smile. till now.

Since their name is VERY similar to ours, I am left to conclude that perhaps you called one of us, didn't like what you were told and weren't sure who to review. I literally have NO IDEA what this is about. In either event, I have been practicing law for 23 years. My partner has been practicing for 24. \"Dishonest\" is not a word I would EVER expect to be used to describe either one of us. We bend over backwards to take care of our clients. If you are actually a client, you should call me (or TEXT ME: 256-503-1185). In my experience fair, open and honest communication usually resolves misunderstandings. ~ Russell"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.  As of May 2020, I have successfully completed the PTIP program and am currently working with Mr. Crumbly on having my charges expunged.  I am very pleased with the services I have received from Mr. Crumbly and his team and would highly recommend them.

This led to several serious concerns I had as to what negative impacts this DUI might have regarding maintaining my current place of employment, a valid Alabama Driver\u2019s License, and the potential for increased auto insurance rates. In addition, I was uninformed of all the specific issues pertaining to Alabama State Law as they apply to a DUI charge especially, with respect to possible fines, imprisonment, unknown future adverse impacts, or establishment of an unfavorable permanent criminal history. The level of stress in my daily life was extremely high, to say the least, due to this situation and these concerns.\n\nI was referred to the Law Office(s) of Russell W. Crumbley to try and sort all these issues out. Russell put me immediately at ease and clarified for me, in a no-nonsense way, what needed to be done to effectively address the DUI charge against me. He also kept me informed as to the current status of my case as it made its way through the Alabama judicial process and provided reassuring personal representation at any and all court scheduled hearings or appointments. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND retaining Russell as your DUI Attorney should you ever find yourself in a similar situation. He is a completely knowledgeable and competent attorney in the area of Alabama DUI Criminal Law and you can rest assured that he will obtain the best possible outcome regarding your case.\n\nSincerely Yours-\n\nGreg Kaltz\n\nP.S. \u2013 Due to Russell\u2019s expertise, he obtained a DISMISSAL of the DUI charges against me!

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

Do yourself a favor and make sure you hire him to take care of yourself because I\u2019d honestly be hesitant to have anybody else to represent me in a potential criminal defense situation besides Mr. Crumbley. To Teles Walker, you won\u2019t find a better attorney or receive a better result than having Mr. Crumbley by your side and am sure you received a contract as Mr. Crumbley is always sure to provide one so everyone out there should disregard any negative reviews because those folks are more than likely either trolls or generally unhappy with their own lives and you can tell the literacy of the individual by reading their review from a grammatical standpoint. To the rest of the folks out there, be sure to disregard the ignorant individuals reviews as that is a false representation of Mr. Crumbleys services. As GUILTY as any individual may be, I can guarantee that you will receive the best possible legal result with Mr. Crumbley by your side and I say that with no doubt in mind. There is a good reason as to why you see his billboards all around our area and it\u2019s for his consistently exceptional results. As always thank you for your outstanding as well as expectation exceeding results Mr. Crumbley.\nYours sincerely,\nAnother Satisfied Client", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1556027434386, "text": "Wow! I have fought for clients for 21 years but, as far as I know, this is the first time a client has fought for me. I never really thought about clients reading other people's reviews before they write their own but I guess they do. I think you were more upset than I was. But, I have learned over the years that people see things, view things, expect things and interpret things differently from each other. As they say: \"one man's trash is another man's treasure\". EVERYTHING must be ALWAYS viewed with the proper perspective. I appreciate your strong, heartfelt words but they weren't necessary. We take cases all across the board and that includes cases that are very difficult and filled with a multitude of considerations, possibilities and opportunities - even for failure. Sometimes the absolute best outcome still falls short of the perfect outcome. I think most people understand that. Having said that, God Bless you young man. Many thanks! ~ Russell"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

I had heard a lot of good things about him and his firm from other people that had used his services. I scheduled a consultation and went to meet Mr. Crumbley. I was very nervous about my situation, but within minutes he had me at ease and feeling confident we would win this case. During our meeting, Mr. Crumbley was very professional and knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I followed his advice and we took the case to a jury trial in the higher court. We were scheduled court dates several times and each time I went, the court wasn\u2019t able to try the case at that time and would reschedule at a later date. Jump forward 6 years (that\u2019s our court system), and the court finally scheduled a court date. So since it had been 6 years, I had moved a couple of times so the court didn\u2019t have my current address so I was never notified of the new date. Mr. Crumbley still appeared in court on my behalf, he informed the court that he had tried to contact me but was unable to reach me. The court was talking about doing several different things, but Mr. Crumbley kept fighting on my behalf to reach a solution that was in my best interest. The day after my court date, I had a missed call, I called the number and it was Mr. Crumbley\u2019s office. His staff found out who had tried to contact me, next thing I know, Mr. Crumbley was on the phone. He told me about the missed court date, and I\u2019m thinking Ok, bench warrant!!!
