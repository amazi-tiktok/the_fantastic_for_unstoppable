If you are talking with a customer you should never interrupt them to ring up another customer. The items are amazing but I refuse to go to a place where I can\u2019t even finish my order because a \u201cVIP\u201d person walked in. It would be different if it were just a quick hand off and he pre-payed but not the case. I am stopped mid sentence and then have to wait for him to pay and then order something else. As though making items don\u2019t already take 10-15 minutes. That makes my visit even longer as well as ruins my mood for the start of my morning. I\u2019d rather go to a competitor across town. And I used to come few months ago and it was always great, quick service. Definitely not the same.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554987543926, "text": "Thank you for the compliment.

I was desparately needing\nhealing on a cellular level in my gut. I ordered the juice every 3 days and I received my order\nevery time with little to no hiccups. The owners even left for vacation and were communicating\nwith me from paradise when I had questions.\n\nNot to mention, juicing from home 4-5 times a day is so laborious and time consuming...\n\nThis is the fourth time I've done a juice fast for this long, but the first one I've done outside\nof my home. This time was different. There was hardly any hunger, no crankiness or headaches.\nI was able to sleep at night and I had amazing energy. Through this fast, I did lose 20 lbs in 20\ndays but that certainly was not the reason for doing it. The doctor wanted to put me on 20 days\nof antibiotics. So, was this expensive? It wasn't cheap but it was an investment for my health\nand much better for my body than taking so many antibiotics. I did see the doctor halfway through\nand they were very impressed with the outcome and my vitals.\n\nI even called them on the day I started back to solid foods because my  yoga teacher training graduating\nclass was celebrating at the Mexican restaurant. The Juicery made sure I had something raw and vegan and\nhealthy to take with me so I could be included in the celebration.\n\nI've been off the fast for about ten days. I crave the juice like I wouldn't have ever imagined. Since\nI came off, I've decided to be vegan and gluten free for a while and it's working wonderfully for me!\n\nI truly believe that the fresh Almond Milk from The Juicery and the Cold Pressed juice changed my\nlife! I look forward to working with them in the future to help fulfill my juicing needs! Everyone who\nworks there is so helpful. I love the owners, the vision, and the concept.
