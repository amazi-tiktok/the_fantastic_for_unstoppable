It also is not in my \u201cbusiness model\u201d.\n\nI was upfront with you, just like I am with all of my customers because the repair cost was equal to the what you paid for your shoes when you bought them.  I will continue to be this way, despite being slapped in the face for it by people who don\u2019t seem to know any better.  Thanks for trying my shop first.

You're obviously not new to bad reviews. You're also misquoting yourself and misunderstanding your job. You unprofessionally laughed in my face and made me have to ask if you were going to fix my shoes or not. It's not your job to tell people if their shoes are worth your time. The shoes I brought to you were actually made in this country (Frye), had barely been worn, and have sentimental value to me. They're currently being mended elsewhere to my satisfaction. If you do not do \"patch jobs\" or \"substandard work\" then maybe consider a more professional approach to declining people needing quick fixes that you do not want to do. It may also be wise to consider that people are coming to you for a service for something they'd like for you to preserve instead of judge. Those shoes belonged to my mother that recently passed away and now they are tarnished with a bad memory of your unprofessionalism.

Lately it seems, that when I try to stop someone from throwing their hard earned money away, they go write something bad about me on forums like this after I've tried to help them. Unfortunately in 2018, I have to tell quite a few people a day that their shoes aren't worth the cost of the repair or can't be repaired at all.  It wasn't like this in 1986 when I first opened my shop.  Most everything was made in our own country and constructed well enough to be repaired. This is no longer the case.  I do not do patch jobs or substandard work.  I either repair it correctly or I don't repair it at all."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889197c9eb00f6b:0x27ac281fc7100d11"}
