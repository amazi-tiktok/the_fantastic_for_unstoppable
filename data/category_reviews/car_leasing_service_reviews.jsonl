My credit score dropped 24 points because of their unethical sales tactics. Most car manufacturers have their on inhouse financial arm so when you run your credit directly through them you only take an 8 point hit so that's why I made the specific request. Because I value my credit score so much it is very high and now I am reluctant to have it run at another dealership to get the car I want because of Alfredo and his companies dishonesty.

I sent my car that was under warranty to Chatom Ford. That was one of my worst mistakes possible. The first week of their service was promising. After that it was all down hill. Shade the \u201cService Manager\u201d was my main point of contact. He would promise me updates and call backs which I would never get a returning call. On October 16th I was PROMISED my car was repaired and ready for pick up. As I had two friends take off work to take me 5.5 hours to Chatom Ford, Shade called me and said \u201cthe car jumped time and is not ready\u201d. The following day I called to get the new date  I could expect my car to be repaired.  Shade then tells me that he had been lying to me and my car was not ready and he does not know why my car is not fixed nor when it could be fixed. During this call he also promised me that the car would be sent to my house in Tennessee. After Shade continued to lie about my car and repairing it, I then moved to speaking with Collin Ward (General Manager)-  I only spoke with him once because he told me \u201c I\u2019m sure what you are saying MAY have happened, but im sure my team has a better way of going about this story\u201d. He also promised I would get a call back from him and I never did. Collin also asked me why I would even send my car here with it being out of state and not send it local (I was on my way back from vacation on the coast when it happened). In my opinion, this should not matter. With no hope, I called asking for the owner, Gene Brown. No one would help me reach him. Then I finally received a call from Kevin O\u2019Brien. He was very promising and reassuring at first as they all were. Kevin worked with my father and I for about two weeks then he stated to not take our calls or call us back as promised. Last, my father began to work with Lara. She was helpful in helping us know what was going on. She is who we worked with for the rest of this mayhem. 99 days later on December 18th Chatom Ford met me in Mississippi to give me my car. This dealership is an ACTUAL JOKE. From day one I asked for nothing but updates and I never once got that. NOT ONE WORKER AT THIS PLACE (I say place because I can not call this a business because this place has no business structure at all.) was truthful in customer service to my father or myself. If anyone at this place has any further questions feel free to contact me as you have my name and number. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME BY NOT SENDING YOUR CAR HERE.

I did not walk out feeling as though a great deal on a vehicle was the only thing I got. I walked out of that dealership with an uplifted spirit and felt through the whole process that I was receiving amazing fellowship and as if I were being edified through this whole process. If God sees fit I will absolutely be a customer for life.They were an absolute inspiration and are a perfect model of a working business  plan that is extremely successful. And I\u2019m not talking only monetarily successful. I left with a fire in me that they helped to burn brighter.

I purchased what was told to me to be my Certified 2015 Chevrolet Suburban LTZ.

When I asked why wasn't these things serviced and replaced before I purchased the vehicle I was told the repairs wasn't necessary at the time. I feel the salesman did a great job but the service department made it a bad purchase by not doing their job!!

Things didn't go quite as we had planned. Our SUV was cutting out pretty bad on the highway. It was getting worse the closer we got to Mobile. I contacted my friend who's daughter lives in Mobile to see if she might know of a service place. I talked with her daughter and she informed me that her husband, Kyle, worked for Joe Bullard Cadillac. She gave me the number for the service department and said to speak with Haley.  About this time the check engine light came on in our vehicle. It was flashing on and off, then would stay lit.\nWhen I spoke with Haley in the service department she asked about the service engine light. When I told her it had been flashing intermittently she was immediately concerned and said we should get stopped as quickly as we could to avoid internal engine damage.  She then helped us get started with finding a tow service. We were 50 miles aWay and had four people so their usual towing service couldn't do it, but she got the ball rolling for us. She gave me her direct phone number so I could call if I needed anything.\nOnce we got to the dealership Kyle helped us get a loaner car while ours was being repaired. Haley kept us informed as they learned what was wrong. Our technician, Mike, came in on Saturday to work on our vehicle because we needed to leave to head back to Missouri on Sunday.\nTo make a long story short...God used all of these people to help us during a difficult time. They made this experience so much less stressful than it could've been. THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP US! And, they did it all with a smile.

What I didn't like was that the mechanics were excessively rough with my vehicle. I had to have it towed and the towing company left it at the gate. Christian got me a loaner car, which I appreciated very much. When I picked up the loaner there were 2 guys who were trying to get it started to get it up to the shop. I needed to grab a couple things out of my car so I stopped to do that. For some reason they needed to open the back hatch. I was traveling with my animals so I had a large kennel in the back. I watched them put my seats down (rather roughly) and sling my kennel from the back to atop the back seats. It made me cringe but at this point I needed to get going as I had some stops to make and  I thought surely they knew what they were doing, this is a Cadillac dealership afterall and these cars cost a lot. They will surely be careful... When I got my car back, instead of them putting the vehicle back they way they found it, the kennel was still strown across the back. (As a plus though, it was washed! Which I appreciated since I had been on the road and try to take care of my car!) When I went to move the kennel back in place I noticed that there are scrapes across the plastic sides in the back. Greeeeaaaaaat. But, at that point I was leaving to head back to my home state and couldn't worry about it. It was more important to get home safe. They told me in addition to the battery that I needed new air filters, a rear wiper blade, and the throttle body cleaned, all easy enough for me to do myself. So, now I am here doing said maintenance and when I popped the hood I immediately noticed that my positive battery terminal clip has been broken and won't stay shut. Great. I am now back home, 3 states away. I will be back to the area, and am considering moving my family there but if they don't make this right I will find a different dealership to maintenance at.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517174513045, "text": "Hi Jami,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review and detailed feedback.

Curtis, Roosevelt and Ty were very courteous to me and my husband. They answered all of my questions and worked with us to get to the price we were willing to pay. The Cadillac warranty is hard to beat, especially the 4 years of maintenance and the road side assistance. This is the 6th GM vehicle that we presently own and I know will be the best serviced one by far. I had been looking for a vehicle for 5 months when I decided to look at the SRX. I am glad I did. It has everything on it that I was looking for plus a lot or more features. Everyone at the dealership that walked by you spoke and asked you how you were doing. This is a dream vehicle for me and I look forward to driving it for years. I will recommend to family and friends that are interested in a great luxury car or SUV to get a Cadillac at Joe Bullard Cadillac in Mobile, Alabama and ask for Curtis. I had to use the service department today to get my oil changed and check the routine things out. Christian and the others were very courteous and took care of me and my SRX.

The moment my fiance and I pulled up to the dealership we felt welcome. Mustafa Elastal immediately greeted us and made us feel important. He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable as he walked around the lot with us picking out suitable vehicles. This was very important to me considering I had never owned a Cadillac before. His extensive knowledge of the vehicle I wanted (XTS) and the history of Cadillac itself impressed me by far. The hospitality didn't stop with Mustafa. Roosevelt Harris also did a fine job answering all the questions I had about the different cars and prices. He also mentioned a couple of nice restaurants we could try out while visiting Atlanta, GA which we did and absolutely loved. Curtis Williams came by and personally greeted us and also had a nice conversation with my fiance. Last, but definitely not least, Jon McCartney was absolutely amazing (and not just because he actually knows where Winnfield, LA is located lol). He worked very hard to get the financing I needed to get the exact vehicle I wanted. It was a hard sale for me, but he showed us that he wouldn't give up. I really appreciated all the time that each of them took out to make our experience the best car buying experience we have had. I would recommend this dealership without thinking twice (I already have mentioned them to others), and I will be bringing others to come do business with Joe Bullard Cadillac in Mobile, AL.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

He offered his help and we told him we were in town to Christmas shop not spend all day at a dealership, we just wanted to try the car on for size. he escorted us inside for coffee and cocoa and went to get the car. we test drove it. we loved it but we were not there to spend all day at the dealership. we left our personal information to be reviewed and were going to shop when Darren notified us that we would be using the cadillac for the day via loaner form approval. we really enjoyed using the car. we Christmas shopped all day and when we returned to the dealership we had been approved for the car with our payments within dollars of request. Jon McCartney had to have been the most professional financial manager i have ever encountered. He was a real person who made us feel right at home and comfortable to speak openly. very friendly and personable. then Roosevelt Harris enters the picture. a gem. a diamond in the rough. so charismatic so joyful and helpful and accomodating. I cannot put into words how much Darren helped to familiarize us with the cue and features. he was so knowledgable of the cars systems. he was an absolute treasure. I cant say but one thing about Joe Bullards team, \"you are doing something right\". I got hugs from everyone when i left. i felt like i was part of a family there. I even got a text message from Darren on Christmas morning wishing us a merry Christmas. i literally spent 2 hrs tops at the dealership and received the most beautiful CHristmas gift I could have ever dreamed of. but the most inportant thing was the environment and kindness that we experienced while there. oh and my son loved the lounge with computers and coffee/cocoa which made his time there enjoyable also. we will definitely reccomend Joe Bullard Cadillac to friends and family and we will definitely be repeat customers ourselves. my only hope is that we have the privilege of having the same staff in years to come.

This is not my first Hyundai since reinventing itself and blowing our minds. Needless to say I purchased what is now my 5th Hyundai.  However, i'm here to brag on the man who walked my husband and I through this entire process in this humid Alabama weather.  Initially, I came in to take advantage of the $50 GIFT CARD that Hyundai was offering for simply test driving its vehicles, but I also knew that I would potentially be driving off the lot with something new as well. Brandon Blagg was awesome from the gate. He stood and walked over to me, invited me to his desk, and inquired concerning my business. A few questions later, a copy of my license, and \"BAM\" we were test driving a base model Santa Fe.' One would think that this guy designed these vehicle with his level of knowledge concerning them. Recalling that I have own several vehicles in my lifetime, it is feasible to understand that we have dealt with our share of sales consultants. This is by far the first person who not only informed us of what we would potentially enjoy about the vehicle, but patiently explained in detail its benefits, and demonstrated  to us its functionality. He took a base model vehicle and literally painted a picture that lifted it beyond it's level. He hung out with us for over an hour doing comparisons and contrasts. He was honest concerning pro and cons, but never negative.. not one time. For him every vehicle had its benefits, and for every person there was vehicle that fit them. THIS IS WHAT HE DID! He didn't interfere with our choice, but he made sure that we would be satisfied once we left  the lot for good. In the end we ended up purchasing a Santa Fe' SEL 2.4 engine with both the Convenience and Premium Package. He didn't use a hustler tactic to cause us to go for a higher grade, it was simply his transparency and patience that ultimately led to our selection. Recalling that this was in 90 + degree weather, this man didn't stop until the tires shined.  He made me laugh, shared stories, explained who was whom of the CEO vs. COO, and also wasn't shy around me whatsoever. He even blew bubble gum bubbles for our delightful 6 year old who stood amazed at the excellence his gum blowing abilities. Brandon Blagg, job well done. You deserve all that's coming for your hard work and dedication to service. Aside from our direct experience with Brandon, everyone rocked. Their pleasantness was superb, two of the women conversed with me, they offered treats to my babies, and others smiled and waved. There wasn't a rude attitude in the building. The lobby and bathrooms are well designed and clean. As lengthly a process that car buying could be, they have enough going for themselves to make you relax and enjoy your time.\n\nThanks Again, Tae A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I test drove the vehicle on a Monday and pointed out a few cosmetic issues that I feel should have been addressed prior to placing the car up for sale (only a few hundred dollars to correct).  That combined with the manager coming outside to talk to me smoking a cigarette, should have clued me in to the professionalism and pride taken at the dealership.\nI was asked that if the problems I pointed out were corrected,  would I purchase the car? I agreed.  The following day I recieved the bill of sale and I noticed that the price shown on the internet was not the price shown on the bill of sale. When I asked the manager, the explanation I recieved was that the car was headed to auction the day I saw it and the price on the internet was the auction price, not the sale price (what does that have to do with me? And the price I came intending to pay is the price that I saw advertised ).  I was then told that they would sell it to me at the internet price but I would have to pay for the repairs which would be $400+.  Since the price was still under book value,  I agreed.  I was then told that the car would be repaired, HAND WAXED and ready for me in a couple days.  I was informed Friday that the car was ready. I drove up Saturday only to find the car just as dirty as it was when I test drove it on Monday(they sprayed the dirt off but there was still hair and dirt on the inside of the car.... wheel wells were dirty, etc). Of all the cars I've bought,  no one has ever tried to delivered me a dirty car! I discussed this with the manager who appeared to care nothing about it.  I left with no intention of buying the car,  but the salesman,\nMr. Willie, called and said that he would take care of it...... he took it to a local shop and had it washed and vacuumed.  As a customer, when money is spent, whether it be $30 or $30,000, you want to feel good about spending it. That's not the feeling I left with.  In the end, I purchased what I feel is a great vehicle.   But the service is what will definitely keep me from being a repeat customer or recommending to anyone else.

And if you do, please, make sure you ask them to print and show you any TSB's (Technical Service Bulletin) on the vehicle you are considering. A TSB is not like a safety recall and therefore the dealership is not required to make the repair. Make them prove to you that they have repaired all of the items on each and every TSB. However, I can almost promise you that they will not make the repairs before selling you the vehicle. I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Entourage van from Jim Burke Hyundai's used car dealership in March this year after having purchased a new Elantra from them last year. I did not make them show me the TSB's because I wasn't aware of them at the time. Unfortunately there are several of them on the van I purchased. One of them had to do with a part that causes called the \"Junction Box Switch\" or Instrument Panel Module that causes the battery to discharge. That means when you go out to your car it simply won't start!! I found the TSB on it and it says in large print that it was issued to all Hyundai General Managers and that the repair should be made before retail sale of the van. Many of us believe that purchasing a used car from what you think is a reputable dealership will protect you from these type issues. Well...this dealership is not reputable and should be put out of business. I have contacted them to give them a change to try and make this right to keep customers happy and try to get return business but they obviously are not intersted in this.

The local companies killed my car, so I traded it in. When doing so JEFF practically tried to scam me. I bought the car in April and didn\u2019t receive any of my paper work until the end of may, that net me a $15 penalty with the DMV for late registration. My payoff check wasn\u2019t sent to my original holder until JUNE 2nd after Calling nearly twice a week since buying the car. Now I have to go through the issue of getting my payments reapplied and corrected so that I\u2019m not in the red on my current vehicle.  If you really really want a Kia go somewhere else. He should never have been allowed to do my paperwork if he wasn\u2019t going to do it right, especially when I left with what I feel is a cheaper version of the car I had.\n\nOnce this is settled and over I hope to never have to step foot near this place again. And I say this whole heartedly the sales rep Lanesha is the only reason and I mean ONLY reason I have not outright reported this location to anyone that would listen.\n\nShe NEEDS a bonus, raise and a few days paid vacation because she has been the only one in the entire building that has actually helped me. I\u2019ve spoken with 2 finance mangers, the sales manager, and a girl in service and out of all of those ppl Lanesha was the one pressing my issue to make sure it was resolved even though she\u2019s in sales and no longer had any part of it.

They don't shove nothing down your mouth. They were easy to talk to, the person who helped me was Tyree, he did a really great job, he was funny too. They were patient, understanding, helpful and very relaxed. I don't have the best credit, and they got me in the car I asked for with the down payment I said I wanted to pay and actually lowered the monthly cost during the final steps. Tyree was really helpful and offered to help me every step of the way. The lot manager, was helpful too I could see him assisting multiple people, he didn't make you feel like he was more focused on anyone, he cared about everyone there buyers and his team, very great guy you can tell. and he was very professional and helpful! He was very informative and if he wasn't sure about something he found out. He let you know what you're getting into and what you could do later. Over all just a real fantastic experience. I've looked at plenty of cars and I'm telling you Kia just is the place to go. On to the service department. I drove by there today before posting a review because Tyree said the service department was great, There was nothing really wrong with my car as I just got it lol, I just wanted to see how they would respond to my questions, I didn't get thier names but the guy there was super friendly and informative. He didn't try to make you feel stupid (because i asked a stupid question) I expected him to to be honest, then they replaced my key battery and even the guy and girl who helped me there were very nice and helpful and funny too.

Well we thought we did. The entire time \u201cMojo\u201d showed the truck, we discussed the motor as well as the other features. Then when we sat down and talked numbers, he presented a piece of paper comparing it to all the other 2016 model F-150s within so many miles and my fianc\u00e9 noticed the motor was listed different than every single other listing,\u00a0so he asked \u201cthis may be a dumb question but this truck\u2019s motor is listed differently. Is that just the way you guys typed it up? Is this truck a twin turbo EcoBoost like the rest?\u201d Mojo replied with \u201c yes exactly\u201d. So we moved forward and we bought the truck. That following\u00a0Sunday my fianc\u00e9 went to look under the hood at something and after some research he found out\u00a0it did not have the 3.5L EcoBoost motor. He called the following \u202aMonday morning\u202c and talked to Mojo. He stated said \u201cmojo do you remember us talking about the truck being an EcoBoost and showing me the comparison sheet of the surround F-150s,\u00a0and I asked about the motor being an EcoBoost, even though it didn\u2019t match up to everything else and you told me yes it is?\u201d He said \u201cyea, yea I do\u201d then My Fianc\u00e8 said \u201cwell Mojo it\u2019s not an EcoBoost. It\u2019s a plain V6.\u201d\u00a0His response was. \u201cOh $@it\u201d. He then said he would talk to management and get back with him. My fianc\u00e9 called him two different times that day. One telling him that he\u2019s still trying to talk to management but they\u2019re busy and the second time was 8 hours later and all they were willing to do was give us an oil change. Both responses were via\u00a0text messages. He would not answer a phone call. So we then called and spoke to a sales manager and he was nice but didn\u2019t have any more to offer. After a couple weeks we were finally able to talk to the sales manager that was working the day we bought the truck. At this point we were over having to deal with them so we settled for a few oil changes and floor mats since the truck didn\u2019t come with any. He stated \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be cheap mats\u201d. Once they finally came in we went and picked them up from the dealership, and they were universal Riverchase kia mats that no where near fill up any of the back seat floor board. We bought better ones from Walmart than the ones they gave us and he only gave one more oil change than the original one. We find this to be highly unprofessional and unsatisfactory. There are thousands of dollars difference as well as the evident performance differences. I\u2019ve also bought a brand new Kia from them in 2017 and it\u2019s crazy we get treated this way after spending so much money with them.

They had a hard time finding my info and the guy spelled my last name wrong even after I spelled it out to him, nor did I get an email reminder as he suggested. I spoke to the lady with whom he suggested as my service rep and again explained the issue to her. She says we can get to you in a couple of hours. 3/12hrs passed and she advises me a diagnostic was done and the suggestions needed. Then told me it would take about an hour to get a tuneup and an oil change. An hour and 20 mins passed  and I went back to advise her of the time frame and asked for a copy of the diagnostic print out that was done and she told me I would get it when I check out. I advised her of their sign and commitment to the customer and her only answer was I told you it would be a couple of hours and you said you would wait. I stated a couple was two and it's now going on 4 hours. There was no compensation for THEIR MIX UP AND MY TIME, NEITHER DID I RECEIVE A COPY OF MY DIAGNOSTIC REPORT. GIVING ME A COPY OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS IS NOT A REPORT. I WILL BE CONTACTING THE SERVICE MANAGER TIM BEARDEN (which is the name I was given) AND THE CORPORATION ALSO!

My lights were flickering on and off in my 2014 KIA Soul and I was scared to drive at night. My warranty was about to expire and I wanted to get my lights checked out. Early August 2018 I drove over to Riverchase KIA early one morning and I told them what was going on with my 2014 KIA. I also needed and oil changed. I waited over an hour for the shuttle to drive me to work, the shuttle drive did not know I needed a ride and HE was super nice!! I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash. Thanks Julio Jones KIA for doing your job and making me feel safe!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

In that respect, I wish ratings could be separated for sales and service as I have never purchased there.\nThe Service Manager is horrible to deal with. He doesn't return calls, he indicates his technicians are incompetent and only he knows how to do things. The service advisor that checked me out -not my SA - told me I was being charged for services never done in the past, except for the fact that my last service was there and the prior one was where I bought the car last year. After more than a month of waiting and being told the SM wasn't in/available during afternoons, etc I called and actually talked to the SM. He ask me to bring it by so he could check. Nothing the techs and advisors talked about with the SM were ever done by the SM. He doesn't care. I honestly feel bad for anyone that works for someone that has to constantly put their employees down since he is the only one that would know how to do anything.\nWhen I stopped by he was very rude and even told me in front of a group of people while hanging onto my car door I wouldn't be happy without getting something free...I told him I would be happy with an actual call back. My car is under warranty, and the SA had even told me she would reach out to a used or new car sales manager for assistance since she wasn't able to get a response (they have no control over service but she was trying). Rating mid level or lower doesn't matter on service reviews, no inquiry then either. After I left, I called the dealership to speak to the GM. I had to leave a message which to this day hasn't been returned.\nThe advisors were not the same ones from my previous visit. Maybe high turnover? Either way, consider another dealership for service. The previous advisors and manager were easy to deal with, albeit I have no idea on the work part not being done as mentioned by new SA. I took my car by the dealership near my parents the same day I saw the SM and they were flabbergasted - that dealership indicated that issues would have came up amd be evident if it hadn't been serviced correctly.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My lights were flickering on and off in my 2014 KIA Soul and I was scared to drive at night. My warranty was about to expire and I wanted to get my lights checked out. Early August 2018 I drove over to Riverchase KIA early one morning and I told them what was going on with my 2014 KIA. I also needed and oil changed. I waited over an hour for the shuttle to drive me to work, the shuttle drive did not know I needed a ride and HE was super nice!! I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash. Thanks Julio Jones KIA for doing your job and making me feel safe!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

I went in for a simple oil change and was then told I needed new front rotors and brakes pads. Okay, I understand that they do need to be replaced, no issues with that. My issue was with them telling me it would cost close to FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. Just for the front. I said hell no, left and went to the AutoZone on the other side of the parking lot and bought rotors and brakes pads for the front AND back for $220. I then found a cheaper mechanic who only charged $100 to replace my current ones with the new ones I had just bought. So I paid $320 or so for front and back rotors and brakes pads when Riverchase Kia tried to charge me $500 for just front. I used to go there every single oil change because they were nice, (sometimes) fast and efficient. I haven't been back yet and I will never go back. It's disgusting how much they try to screw people out of money. $1,000+ to have front and back rotors and brakes pads replaced... Out of their MINDS!!!!

Wednesday as I\u2019m driving home, oil light comes on and smoke from under the hood. I made it home and found oil leaking from under the car. I call Wednesday to make an appointment to bring my car in on Thursday to be fixed. Thursday I arrive around 8:20 that morning and drop the car off so I could get to work that I was already late for. I called them around 1-2pm the evening to check status of my car. Season stated they hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet and it was being sent somewhere else were it would be checked out in more detail. So they put me in a rental covered by them. They called Friday afternoon and said my car was ready and I asked why was it leaking oil and they said the plug was stripped and that it wasn\u2019t a Kia plug. If the technician knew the plug was stripped why did he put it back on there, regardless of if it was a Kia plug or not. Also, Wednesday when I came to drop the car off, I told them that I would like to get the recalls fixed on it since I already had to drop the car off. I asked the person checking me in did he need the recall papers that I had gotten sent in the mail and he said he could look it up by the VIN. Saturday morning I come in to pick up my car and ask them for diagnostic report on what was done on the car & they tell me about the plug and I asked were the recalls fixed and they said it wasn\u2019t any notes about a recall needing to be fixed. The guy that checked me in Wednesday stated he didn\u2019t remember me saying anything about a recall and he was sorry, Season said they would get it in to be fixed because of the situation but they normally do not do recalls on saturdays. I already knew that because of the previous Saturday I came in for the oil change and asked about the recall. So I guess the pros would be that she did say they would fix the recalls but cons is that I still have to sit and wait on my car on something that they were supposed to had already done. I also spoke with Tim the supervisor about the issues that I was having. I am stuck in a hard place because Riverchase Kia is the only Kia dealership in Birmingham, and I don\u2019t want just any person working on my car and thought I was doing the right thing by bringing to their service center. So I gave them two stars, one for getting the recalls fixed on a Saturday and the other for putting me in a rental while they were getting my vehicle fixed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

He was so sweet (I almost want to put that into satirical marks) while we talked through wait periods. Good family guy who is proud of his kids and was very generous in his compliments to my husband. This was fine. I would have left a 5 star review with just that interaction. He didn't seem to push us into anything particular or expensive because we knew what we wanted and he knew that too. To be honest, my husband knew more about the cars on that lot than most of the salesmen at the store. To be even more honest, we had no intentions of buying a car that day, but we were talked into it. Not a horrible choice, but not my optimum choice at this time. In the end I wanted to make my husband happy and get a hybrid because it is better for the environment and because we commute a lot. I would have waited a year or two before doing this, but that is out the window now. However, all of that isn't the issue. While we were there, everyone was nice. Stayed there for almost 5 hours getting paperwork done and waiting to be approved for a loan. We're young and like to talk, so we didn't mind. We get a fair interest rate, seeing as how my husband just came out of bankruptcy. This is good. We sign all the contracts, my husband haggles about the extra warranty. All of that is good. We hand over the keys to the car we traded in, clean it out and into our new car, etc. All of the contracts are signed, everything is good. We leave HAPPY. Very happy. Extremely proud of our car.\n\nThis is when things start to go bad. I get a call a few days later because they lost my husband's pay stub. No problem. He sends an email with a new one. This apparently isn't \"clear\" enough \"for the banks.\" Alright. So he sends another one, a PDF copy as clear as day. A human mistake happens and he misspelled Stan's email (missed 1 s). A week almost goes by and I haven't gotten any calls, and neither has my husband. We think everything is fine so we forget about it. Not to mention, it is the end of the semester for me, so the only thing I am worried about it getting homework done, studying for exams, and emailing people from my school email. This, however, is where some of the blame falls onto me. I had gotten 3 emails from Stan on the 4th and on the 5th. The email on the 4th was fine. It just wanted a new copy because he couldn't find an attachment (because of the mess up earlier as my husband was at work and had just made a human error). The third and last email is where I am taking away 3 stars and am very upset about. It is added into this review, untouched outside of cutting away unnecessary bits of the screenshot of my computer screen. Seeing as how the place is a business, I find no issue with giving away the details in this email. In my opinion, I find the tone of the email to be very unprofessional, threatening, and rude. He could have called (in my call logs I received no calls from him and neither did my husband). Calling would have resolved the issue immediately because any decent person would have realized the mistake and apologized and immediately resent the email correctly with the attachment. Yet, it is okay to threaten to take away a car. And I get it. The bank is putting on pressure to get the pay stub or else they will back out and that is bad for the dealership. However, WE weren't the ones who lost the original pay stub in the first place. WE weren't contacted in a more timely manner about it via phone call. Instead, my junk email just so happened to get checked by my husband yesterday while he was handling other business on the phone and he sees all of the emails. He resends what needs to be resent, and now we wait to see if any other \"problems\" will arise. Will our signatures be unclear next and somehow void our contract? Will they try to repossess our car because of any other errors on their behalf? Only time will tell.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

Let me provide you a little setup for my situation that this amazing dealership managed to turn around for me. End of 2014 my old Saturn (yes, the car dealer that went under) with its cracked suspension was traded into a dealership that I thought was reputable. Well put you in a new car they said, don't worry about your credit they said, I end up in the most manual of manuals; roll down windows and all Versa Note. Alright, I can turn this around, I tell myself, they said come back in a year and well get you in something nicer. Year rolls by, go back, \"Nope your credit isn't good enough, you got money to put down? Nope, then cant help you, try again next year.\" Alright, so I continue with this car that I am not happy with, upgrade jobs, still upside down in this car years later. Now its December 2017, still upside down in a car I am not happy with. I hear a jingle on my radio, you all know the one, \"We wanna see yea at Riverchase Kia.\" My wife and I talk and decide lets take a chance, what have we got to lose, if we don't like it we can always walk away. I do my research, and go in with an open mind, telling myself I want one of two vehicles. Optima or Forte. I park at the dealership and out walks one of the best, brightest, and positive salespersons I have ever met. Mr. Lionel T. Lee. I had time to stand and stretch on this cold winter day when he greeted, us. I was not set to meet anyone in particular but I am so glad I met this man. He took us to his desk and talked to us a few minutes about our situation and our plans, asked what I wanted and within 15 minutes he came back. He broke down my station for me but did not send me away.\n\nI am a negative person here folks, of course I was thinking everything had gone to hell and I was just wasting mine and his time, but Mr. Lionel was positive, he said, \"I cannot get you an optima, but I am going to get you in a new car. Trust me. I have the perfect one in mind too. How do you feel about a forte.\" My mind went everywhere but I tried to play the shrewd buyer, I said sure I would be happy to consider if the price is right. And off he went again, another fifteen minutes and back he was to grab his scarf, \"Oh you guys are in for a treat, wait here!\" Five minutes later I was asked to walk outside and man was I blown away! The Forte was beautiful, I mean pearl white, leather, backup camera, you name it it was in there. I was speechless, he asked what I thought, take a seat, get a feel for it because man this is going to be your car. I know it. I sat in it and never wanted to leave, going from a manual base to this luxury model, you know I almost drooled a little. He asked, \"What do you think, anything you want to change on it?\" The only thing I could think, \"Got it in Grey or Silver!\" He just grinned and said, \"Yeah, I sure do. Wait here.\" Exact same model, color I want, hasn't even been an hour and I am test driving the car I could not be happier with! Then the standard numbers talk goes by, no one likes this part but I will state for full disclosure that I was in the negative over 6k on my old car, I was expecting that I was going to have it a little rough but you know it was not nearly as bad as I thought. The discounts were amazing, in fact I walked away an hour later one of the most satisfied kia customers, keys and paperwork in hand and taking a picture in front of my new vehicle. Thank you so much Mr. Lionel for putting up with all my negativity and fighting for me to get me in this new vehicle. Hell I sat in it all day yesterday just playing with all the new toys and features, you are an amazing salesperson and even more so just an amazing person to help someone like me. Thank you again! We will be seeing you again next year to get her out of that jeep!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My car died during the ice storm, and I HAD to buy a car.  Here are the problems I observed:\n\n1. 12 salesmen standing out front, half of them smoking cigarettes... certainly not illegal, but it just automatically makes any business look really bad fast.  Plus, they obviously overhired, maybe to motivate car sales by putting more hungry vultures on the lot.\n\n2. I dealt first with a guy named Adam.  He was nice enough... the sales manager obviously sensed my hesitation, so he swooped in and began his \"Pushy sales guy\" mode.  At one point when I started to get up and leave because I felt uncomfortable, he told me I promised him I would buy a car from him if the numbers were right for a used model.  I wanted a new car.\n\n3. Don't even bother looking at the prices of Kias online -- when you get there, everything is 5 to 6 thousand dollars more.  See, that's when they offer you the $6,000 trade in on any model.  Then, they'll act as if they're such great guys doing you such a favor.  It's ludicrous.\n\nI went directly to another dealership, found a car I liked at a reasonable price, and drove away happy.

Felt we got ripped off a little and found out they tried to get lending from so many places for the incorrect amount and causes unnecessary credit inquiries. That was annoying to find out weeks after the fact and that they hid it from us. But the big issue is their service. It is impossible to make an appointment for your \"free\" oil changes. When you do arrive they push a pkg that's like $65 so you can get a tire rotation and other crap. Then when you pick about charging that much for the \"free\" oil change they say, they'll take the oil change portion of that off the top like they are doing you a favor. Then they claim you need a new filter or something or other, which they changed at the last oil change 5,000 so I ask how often that's needed and they claim it's needed every 10,000-15,000 not knowing we just had it done the time before.

We were after a slightly used but still certifiable new to us SUV.  Teddy met with us.  He asked what we were looking for in a purchase today, and said that he would do his best to keep us from going anywhere else.  Teddy did just that.  We were up front with him on the financials that we had and the monthly payment we need to stay around.  My wife was looking for something older with many more miles, but I wanted to have something that had warranty and miles to a minimum.  Teddy brought us a single option, The Right Option.  A very low mileage Sorento with transferable warranty.  The test drive sold it to my wife, and I signed the line.  We got an extremely well kept Sorento, with a detailed one owner record review by Teddy.  He answered the questions we had and some that he knew we should ask but not know to.  He was easy to work with.  He was knowledgeable  and we are a family with a great ride.  The experience was great, our turn around time for paperwork was minimal, our satisfaction was at the maximum.\nThe entire experience was better than I expected.  They treated us very well.

I understand she have to tell me the fee etc.. but my car is only 2yrs old, and at that moment I didn't want to hear about money, I just wanted professionalism and just let me know it will be OK. I just said make me an appointment for Friday and I will come back. I went back Friday morning and spoke with a pleasant young woman by the name of Season. I think that was her name, b/c it was a unique name. She told me the SAME thing the other lady stated but in a different tone, and made me feel as though she cared. She even let me know by the car being new it may be covered under warranty. I told her my husband can get a gauge to ck it etc.. And she said if we do all that then it's still not working then it's likely a issue that will be fix with no out of pocket expense. I took my car back home again, and my husband did ck it Sunday, and the gauge showed Freon in the car, but stated to take it to the professionals. I then took off work Monday and brought my car back and Season's was there also.. I was happy b/c at this point I was just tired of going into circles. She let me know it may be a wait and was honest about it, and the fee again. I waited 2hrs, but I didn't care b/c I wanted my air fix, and to top it off it was under warranty. Anytime you are dealing with something that is a touchy subject about your car, b/c that is your way of survival and also getting around.... you want people to be knowledge of what's going on, and the situation.

I had to take it somewhere else to find and correct the tire issue as the dealership informed me that new tires ride a certain way the first 500-750 miles.  I've purchased a number of brand new vehicles, and never encountered a vehicle shaking/vibrating like that.  After I requested that they check again (leaving it with them), I was informed that the tires had too much air. After the issue still existed, I took it elsewhere and it drove so smoothly once the out of balance tire was fixed.  They stated that they would reimburse me.

Well guess what? Not so, they said I would have to pay for the balance.\n\nBefore my free oil change, I ran over a small screw and my back left tire was loosing some PSI. Called the dealership and they told me I would have to pay $250 + for a new tire and work. They said they couldn't patch it.

I'm told by Daniel that they would look at it THAT DAY. Although he told a guy in line in front of me that it would be Wednesday before he could get an diagnostic. I call Daniel back later that evening for him to tell me that it would be the next morning (Tuesday) before they could look at it. I call Daniel again at 12pm Tuesday and he said that they looked at it off and a couple times but they really haven't looked at it thoroughly and that it would be later that day. I called around 3pm and he said that he would let me know something before they left that day. No call. I call again on Wednesday @at 12 pm and I'm left on hold for a few minutes and the secretary comes back to take a message. He supposedly was  busy with another customer. I don't get a call. Again, I call back around 430pm and he tells me that the mechanic had to hold my battery cable to start the vehicle. And it would be $650  to change my battery cables. SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS!!  I show up Thursday morning to pick my vehicle up and it won't start. Mind you, I started the vehicle everyday for two weeks since having the initial problem. Daniel laughs in my face  when I expressed that to him. After I left I tighten the battery cable(30 second process)and the truck starts just fine. I took that as we don't want to fix your vehicle if you expect us to do what we say.

The day of the purchase one of the warning lights was on, the dealer ship couldn\u00e2  t figure out why it was on and how to get rid of it, That was my first incident  with the car, but since I drove over an hour away to pick the car up I trusted the dealership in that the car was good and they said that it was just a sensor. Two days later the check engine light came on , still thinking that it was the sensors, I over look at the magnitude of the situation. Exactly 4 weeks after having the car, it started smoking so I had to get it towed to Mini Cooper. Mini informed me that I have an oil leak, my turbo went out, and other things. My grand total for repairs come to 13,000 dollars. I think that it was very unprofessional and dishonest that You sold me a car that needed so much work done to it.

We drove in from north of Nashville, about 4 and a half hours. I had the pleasure of working with Grant over the phone, then Michael when we arrived. The vehicle we purchased was EXACTLY as described over the phone by Grant, he even sent me pictures via text. He was upfront, honest, and just so kind. When we arrived, the vehicle we came to see was parked in the front and ready for us to look over and test drive. Michael answered all of our questions and was very helpful. When it was time to complete our sale, Grant already had all of our paperwork done ahead of time, it took about 30 minutesto sign a few things  then walk out the door with our new vehicle.\n\nWe had been looking for a month for a replacement vehicle for me after mine was totaled. I spoke with numerous dealerships within a 150 mike radius of Nashville. There were several times that we drove over an hour out of our way to see one, only to arrive to find the vehicle was NOT at all as described, it was beyond infuriating. Premier Chevrolet was 100% up front and honest from the first phone call. We will absolutely do business with them again, and also recommend them to our friends and family should they be looking for a vehicle.\n\nThank you so very much to Grant and Michael for going above and beyond what I even expected from a car dealership. It was so great to meet you both, and we really appreciate you and your hard work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536793650159, "text": "We strive to be the best for you and your car Emily.

He even went as far as check to see if my 2016 Yukon may be covered with some discount related to the same failure but it appears that GM thinks that it is OK for a part to fail at 60k miles but not at 61k miles.\n\nDealers should be doing more to convince corporate GM to protect their potential customer base.
