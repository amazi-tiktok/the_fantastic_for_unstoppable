My wife met with Cason and we went into wanting multiple options which i thought were all fairly presented and well explained without any pressure of which to go with. I have a close friend who worked for many years for both Trane and Carrier with many of the dealers throughout Birmingham. He gave me a list of 3 companies he would have out to his home personally. Skelton was one of those, another company that i liked very much, and then one we didnt have a great experience on the quote with. Between Skelton and the other competitor, although Skeltons price was higher we were sold by the labor warranty and some of the other written guarantees, along with the rec from our friend. Installation - I believe it was Mark, my wife was the one on site - went way better than i could have imagined. We arranged last minute to have the unit moved to a new location. All of the work was very well done. I had an idea in my head of what \"the aftermath\" should have looked like and the equipment involved in the move and all that, and i probably would have been satisfied with a lot less. Its obviously a lot of money for most families, so I was bound to have some mix of buyers remorse and hesitation about whether or not we'd gone with the right people However, when i got home and saw the quality of the work, how neatly and efficiently and professionally everything was done, i immediately felt entirely confident in our decision and knew we had some true professionals out at the house. I think its the first time in my life ive spent that much money on something and dont have any regrets or second guessing about who we chose to spend it with. Kudos to both Cason and Mark's teams.

One of their service vans was camped in the left lane, doing 10mph under the speed limit,  blocking traffic for miles.  When I motioned for them to move over so we could pass, both occupants of the vehicle smiled and waved.  They did this repeatedly, but refused to move.  Simply taunting me and those behind me.  After I was able to pass them by switching lanes several times, they proceeded to speed up and slow down, pull up next to me and both smile and wave.  Again, just being as disrespectful as possible, all while still refusing to move from the passing lane.  I called their office and received no answer during posted business hours.  People who are disrespectful enough to hold up a quarter million people and then taunt them while doing it, will be coming nowhere NEAR my home.  Absolutely atrocious the way Birmingham was just treated.  DO NOT PATRONIZE!!!!  COMPLETELY DISRESPECTFUL.  I'll continue to spread the word about this company until I'm notified of these two employees receiving disciplinary action.  If they do not, then obviously this company condones disrespect and gives us even more reason to never patronize them.

Our building contractor recommended Island Air-Air Conditioning and Heating, Gulf Shores, AL. My husband and I previously lived in several homes with HVAC problems stemming from poor design and installations. We knew we wanted to avoid those with new construction.\n\nI initially met with Rob Barnas of Island Air to explain our HVAC desires. Rob and Chris designed a plan to address the \"wants & needs\" of our system. It's very easy to install flexible ducts improperly, but Eddie and the men ran the ducts and attached the air handlers with great care.\n\nNew HVAC systems are very expensive. I did not want to buy a new system and suffer the same issues that we had to pay to have repaired in previous houses. So, throughout the construction process I asked dozens of questions.  I'm sure this was tiresome for Island Air, but they were very patient with me. Honestly, how can anyone be expected to properly operate and care for a system unless they understand how it's supposed to work? Hahahaha. Also, I wanted to understand the system while I could still see the components. Our drywall is not up yet. We are now 4 months into construction, so not far enough along to have thermostats installed or have the system turned on. However, we are enough along for me to say I am happy this far with the work done by Island Air of Gulf Shores, AL. I will try to post again after we move in to give everyone a final report on how it feels to live in an HVAC system built by Island Air.\n\nPS. In case you are wondering. I am not related by blood or personal connections to anyone at Island Air and have received no discounts or other incentives for posting this review.\nD.

The initial job was well done.  I was happy with the work that I entered a service agreement for my upstairs unit. In 2016 my trust with the company was severely damaged when the AC tech charged me for the part that was still under warranty and I had to call them on it.  To the company credit, they did \"refund\" me with the credit on the next repair job in the spring of 2017.  I paid the invoice without examining it carefully as I should have done.  Two months in late May of 2017, I received a letter from the Baldwin County small claim court saying that Island  Air is suing me for nonpayment.  I called them and the manager told me that all this can go away if I pay them at that point.  I went home and dug up all my paperwork and found out that they overcharged me once again on the visit in spring 2017.  I faxed them my receipts and called them the next day and advised them not to go ahead with the lawsuit because they will not win in court.  They rescinded the the court claim and offered me a six month maintenance complimentary service for my inconvenience,  but after all the shenanigans I have to walk away.  The trust factor is no longer there.  I waited for four months to write this review to make sure that my emotion is in check and to give them a fair review about my experience with the company.   Take home points?  Save your receipts and you need to know about the warranty your AC system.  Always go check the charges line by line and make sure to keep this company honest.

The Service Techs as well as the Office Schedulers are MOST FRIENDLY and do everything they can to make sure that I am happy with all aspects of the service requested and received.  In my opinion, Ron and Ginny Barnas have done a SUPERB JOB of employing the best people available and managing this business in a sound professional manner.  Whenever I am asked by a new Gulf Shores Resident for a recommend for HVAC service my answer is ISLAND AIR for sure and  no one else.\n...tom bice 2016-04-19.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a06708b4087b1:0x62be4394ebf2a98b"}

Home Warranty A/C contractor (not Service Air) also tried to charge me a TON of uncovered cost. I contacted Service Air and reviewed my cost.  Service Air agreed to help me out for a entire new unit instead of piece by piece repairing my upstairs unit.

The owner, Shane, is very personable and the kind of guy you can trust with your door unlocked. Opie (dead ringer for a younger Ron Howard), his technician, is a relatively young guy (23), but mature beyond his years and a very good HVAC tech. He's also trustworthy and the kind of guy you would want to represent your company. Most importantly, he was able to diagnose my heat pump problem quickly and efficiently...10 to 15 minutes. The HVAC was over amped.\n\nThe company that installed my TRANE XL14 heat pump in 2007, Alabama Climate Control (ACC) of Huntsville, apparently did not notice that the heat pump was rated for max amperage of 40 amps because they did not bother to change the 50 amp circuit breaker in the panel in the garage. One would expect a professional HVAC company to do a basic electrical circuit check/test to ensure the electrical circuit is compatible with your NEW heat pump...right!?!?\n\nAnyway, this oversight by ACC resulted in a fried circuit breaker in the junction box at the heat pump. Opie said we were lucky this situation did not result in a burned up motor or worse a burned down house. After all that, Opie tried to give me a $25 discount because I'm a veteran.\n\nThank you for the sentiment Opie, but also thank you for identifying a problem that has caused me great anguish over the years. I had to replace 3 or 4 compressors on the original heat pump (a Rheem) about 15 years ago when we first started renting out the house.\n\nThe HVAC company (same ACC) kept replacing all those compressors under warranty at $250 to $300 a pop for labor, but just couldn't figure out what was causing all those compressors to burn up (the same 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker box). Then, I was dumb enough to hire them again to install a new TRANE in 2007. Remeber, the TRANE is rated for a maximum of 40 amps, but ACC left the same old 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker panel. Voila...we get a fried junction box this time.\n\nIncredible...that it took a young 23 year old tech with a lot less experience (but more common sense and intelligence) to recognize that a 50 amp circuit breaker is going to eventually cause some problems if it is not compatible with the rest of the circuit.\n\nThe cautionary tale here is...be extremely vigilant and careful about who you let work on your electrical systems and watch them like a hawk when they do...until you find a company like SMS that has techs like Opie.. Thank you SMS and Opie for saving my house from a potential fire.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462206716420, "text": "Thanks Dwight! We are very happy we could take care of your heat pump needs!

The smell was intermittent so I wasn't sure if there was an issue. The first time Sonny came out & took care of the downstairs gas smell.  A few hours after he left the air purifier wasn't working.  Eddie came to our house and fixed and also noticed the \"dryer\" was installed backwards on the both units.

Once there, he told me that we had blown the transformer and fuse on the main unit and the cost at that point would be $624 to replace those 2 things and rewire the thermostat. I told him I couldn't afford that and he said \"well mam I can't help you with that. There's nothing else I can do for you then.\" I needed my ac running so I gathered up every cent I had and told him to go ahead with the repair. He then came in and told me that the thermostat wasn't telling the unit to kick on so we must have fried the new thermostat also. He left the base plate wired up and told me that it was wired correctly and I just needed to go get a new touchpad and it would work. He is a professional and I trusted his word so I paid him the $600 and he left without it working. It was late Saturday night so I ran and got the new one first thing Sunday morning. I put it on the wall and it would not work. I had to call another repairman to come out and fix it Sunday. There was nothing wrong with the 1st thermostat. The problem was that the Jolly technician wired it wrong. Now I question everything he did that night. I feel like I paid a lot of money for absolutely nothing. I have called twice and cannot get a call back. I should have refused to pay but I trusted this guys word. I will not make that mistake again.

There is nothing more aggravating than to have your air conditioning unit quit. Although it is mid-October we needed our air conditioning fixed ASAP. Our unit was 17 years old and I knew we needed to replace it if not immediately, within the very near future. I emailed a few companies Saturday night asking for estimates and to please contact me Monday morning. Only Autumn Air and one other company returned my call today. Autumn Air was very pleasant and offered to have someone come out to price the unit immediately. Since I knew I did not want to start throwing money away repairing such an old unit I asked for a quote for a new unit (with and without the furnace). Skip came out and priced the unit with three options and it was clear if I wanted more options he would give them to me. He did not acted putout or frustrated with my request. He did not pressure me to make a decision nor did he push me to buy the most expensive product. Without me asking, he let me know the specials that were being offered. I asked how soon they could install the unit and he said either this afternoon or in the morning. I called my husband and sent him the estimates. My husband was impressed and even showed his fellow employees who were also impressed with the prices. After weighing the pros and cons we decided to replace the entire unit (with furnace). I called Skip back about 2:30 saying we did want to go ahead and replace the unit, he said he would call me right back, that it would be either this afternoon or in the morning. I was floored when he called me back shortly afterwards and asked if it was okay with me if they could install it today. Skip and two other gentlemen came and installed the unit working hard until close to 9:00 pm. We were all extremely grateful to the diligence of these men. In addition, Autumn Air included a 2-year service plan where they will come out to service/clean the unit twice a year. They have earned my trust. I am very thankful to Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSUL9QRFJSPykXqDzrNKpCip6nXxO_y7dxFY68=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2RdAWKk5TI7OZtRl8wgn94aokdQNwgFcu2UXt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEyoCn2esr-2rrYIf35lCntXDGlIln-damn4kj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532696719, "text": "Thank you!!!!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

{"user_id": "117764367263681419355", "name": "John Hosmer", "time": 1505317915712, "rating": 5.0, "text": "For a long while there have been atmosphere issues in our basement where the previous home owners had never taken care of sealing up the rooms and keeping temps and humidity in check. We had addressed those issues and we had tried using good filters at the returns to prevent as much of any dust, mold spores, etc. from recirculating and spreading, but it ended up being a losing battle for both comfort and our family's health.  Finally, about a month ago I disconnected one of the flexpipes at the end of the trunk run to see just how bad it was and found almost 100% coverage of dust, mold, and nastiness throughout the system. It was in every bit of the trunk, and every flexpipe throughout the house (See pictures). Even a few of the vent registers had started harboring mold growth which was a really bad sign as well.\n\nSo, I did what any good panicking homeowner would do at that point. Went to Google, pulled up nearby HVAC companies with good reviews that could do duct replacement, and called for appointments for onsite inspections. Out of the four highly reviewed and reputable companies (minus individual contractors) in the Pelham area that actually showed up for their appointment, Autumn Air's rep Baker was the only one who showed up on time, actually visually inspected inside the ductwork even after I showed him the initial pictures I took, and then spent a solid amount of time explaining to me options for replacing the entire ductwork system so we could see about what would be right for our budget. In the end, the price that Autumn Air was able to provide for an upgrade to a new round smooth metal interior and outside insulated wrapped system, including new boots and registers, throughout the entire house, plus a new central AprilAire Space Guard filtration and iWave-R GPS ionization system upgrade (per my request) beat out the one other company who actually sent me a quote by almost half. Let me say that again differently...TWO of the four companies NEVER sent back a quote. This told me that two of the highly reputable companies in the Pelham area that have a high amount of favorable reviews simply did not want a job. Pitiful for them.\n\nFast forward to the install a week later...Led by two guys named Javy and Charles, they took care of making sure everything was treated with care when taking out the old ductwork so as to minimize spreading of dirt and mold as much as could be. Then, they proceeded to assemble and install all of the new system on site for custom fitting plus making sure all seams were taped properly and coated with mastic so that the chances of air leaks past the coils is forever kept at a minimum. They arrived early in the morning, and worked until the job was finished that evening (on the day of Harvey storms coming through too!).  Any questions I had concerning anything with the job was answered and explained with no hesitation on their part.  They went beyond expectations with accommodations and I just can't be any happier.\n\nI can't say it enough in this entire description here how great Autumn Air is for an HVAC company. They want someone's business in the best way because they give the work the best service they can at reasonable prices, and offer great financing options too if needed. They understand how to go the extra mile to make sure the customer is being taken care of in the end as well. I can say I have also had the pleasure of meeting Jeff, the owner, later when he came back to look at a minor issue that crept up post install, and he is just as awesome about discussing more than the \"here's what we'll do\". He takes the time to explain the why and how's (if you are interested to know and ask) and will work with you as a customer to do everything he can within reason to make sure you are satisfied with him and his company. Because of all of these things described about everyone at that company and how we were treated, we now not only have clean, sanitized fresh air, but the confidence to know it will stay that way due to the complete service and professionalism we got from Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMabAWy162GH96gyl3m37sUEbn3lZkhH_QMnw5p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_X0ScvBCZDov4a77tJ8--jNZxa4SLKPRwf7ZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2_SRCsbshQYMwunCW_Svt09o-TDruxZ8tozW8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKpjJ6ZJSD3l76fC4DaZ5moDrfqENk5DrC3V5m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVryaFeSx9Ipmsmn5UNXwMOBC9HZqnM-6Io7MO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532681755, "text": "Thank you for sharing your review of our company!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

You get a discount on all service  after you sign up !\nReally, $120 a year for the PM plan  ?? i thought he misquoted so I jumped on it but its for real ! Great service, great guy. You rock Corey !

The buyer's \"inspector\" (loosely used here) said the unit had a serious problem. I had the unit maintained twice per year (it is important to note that this twice yearly maintenance was not done by Ethridge) for each of the 10 years since the unit was installed so I didn't really believe that much could be wrong with it but was required to have it checked out.\nAfter thoroughly inspecting and testing the unit, the Ethridige technician called to let me know the unit was fine, in fact he found no problems at all.\nHe could have easily gone with what the \"inspector\" said and the repairs or replacement could have made them a lot of money. But, this company chooses ethics and honesty and in doing so earned a customer.\nI recommend this company and I plan to contact them for a maintenance contract for my home because I know these folks will not take advantage of me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df6f49a4e087:0xc07a7a3126b15675"}
