Well then they calm down and want me to stay but they treated me very badly. Jay and Mona the owners at one point had 10 flooded rooms down stairs and they were full of mold and had no carpet in them but still said I had to pay 65 a day or work for just the room up at all hours of the night. Marvin the guy up there at this present time came to me the last time I stopped to see my wife because I had been for a couple of days to see my kids because my kids weren't allowed to visit with me there and Marvin told me to get off the property or I would be arrested. My mother came by at one point with my children to bring me some groceries and Mona got mad and said I had to many people in the room. They were just dropping off groceries. I was accused of stealing from them and when they found the tools they accused me of stealing in the owner Jay's van never once did I get an apology and in the end they ended up ruining the relationship between me and my wife and I've lost her due to everything that took place because of them. Marvin is very racist because I was talking to some black rappers that were passing through town and got a room and while I was talking to them Marvin comes out assuming it's a drug deal.

There was also a strange odor. We stayed because it was cheap and they had already charged my card for 2 nights. The ice machine was broke and look like something out of a horror film. We stayed 2 days without the room being cleaned or any garbage bags or tissue so we bought our own. I called the front desk to get a noon check out and was rudely told NO by a white guy posing as the manager. So we left at 11 and by 1:00 my card was charged an additional $50 for a cleaning fee. First of all when do hotels start charging for a free service. The room was already a smoking room so there is no charge for that. We stayed 2 days and did not have the thrash changed or given any bags for thrash. I threw all of my garbage in the thrash can and tried to straighten the room up as best as I could but after Mr Manager rudely told me to get out I did not clean the room since you have a housekeeping department for that.

This is a trophy hunt.  I wanted to kill a big buck, so i passed on a lot of deer.  This was a mid december hunt.  So, the really big bucks were moving at dark.  I didnt kill a deer, but that was my decision.  I will go back", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ded513b45ce47:0x499cfe45c89a44cd"}
