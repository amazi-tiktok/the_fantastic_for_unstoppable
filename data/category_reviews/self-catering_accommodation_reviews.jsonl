They spent time with us and treated us so nicely. I asked how long they have been in business and they said 3 weeks!!!! Well, we told the world how great this place was! Then we moved to Gurley, Alabama and only visited 306 once in a while. I was so sad! Finally we bought a home in Decatur, Alabama and soon found out that they opened another location at the old Greenbriar restaurant that had closed. Hallelujah!!!! We are back in business for good eating again!!!
