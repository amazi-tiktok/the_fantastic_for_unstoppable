In 2008 I was injured and sought medical treatment for lower back pain. Upon several months of on going Dr visits and treatment I was unfortunately forced to undergo Two lower back surgeries which although did not rid my condition completely it did allow me to walk again and I chose to undergo Pain Management with the Center of Pain under the treatment of Dr Herrick. For the past 11 years I have seen Dr Herrick and he and his staff have provide a borderline comfort to ease my pain and give me my life back. Within these past 11yrs I have had to relocated south of his office in Montgomery to Gulf Shores which is roughly 175 miles and again to North Alabama roughly 200 miles away. Being unable to live a life with my family without suffering from daily pain. I am at The mercy of medical treatment. But Being so far away from the Dr Herrick I had to make a simple choice to find a new Dr or travel the 3hrs to continue treatment with the Center of Pain under Dr Herrick treatment. I have had one other Dr in the past 11ys administrate a Epidural to my lower back and I was not satisfied with the treatment nor did this Procedure help my pain. I wish not to speak bad on any other Dr or Pain Management Clinic but for me I have never had one bad experience or visit during my time with the Center of Pain. The staff has always gone above and beyond their means to ensure my visit and treatment has provide relief to my symptoms. Dr Herrick has always been understandable and provided a course of relief for me weather it be medication or procedure Epidurals.

Was a unorganized visit with staff coming in & out of exam room including MD. Not sure why he had to leave each time.  Doesn't seem like he was able to come up with a plan today. I've got an inoperable problem & I've been to so many doctors in \u00ee  & Atlanta Georgia with no one knowing how to k k the>& use it properly are paying a high price with our quality of life. The walls in this was8MD's office are pasted with 11x8 peices of printer papers stating things about their rules, laws, business & more rules & regulations if u take any pain medication. Upon this being my new patient visit I was not impressed  my visit today especially as was directed to exit ... & btw stop at Lab 1st for a drug test. What? I've gotten no scripts from this MD, no thx plan, no instructions, no answers ... and yet they want a drug that I'll have to pay for if my insurance doesn't cover it. I could see if I was receiving care, medicine, treatment from MD, but for a consultation? I don't care about the test, I know I'm clean, but it makes u feel like your not trusted, dirty, bad person... just brings u down.  I understand why there's a need, but it could have either been omitted or instructed better instead of here being handed a cup, told to leave your purse, coat, & anything else outside of bathroom that u don't even have a sink to wash up until u open door & use community sinks.  So to sum it up... it was just a  okay visit that had opportunity to have been much more. I've got to come back so maybe next time more will be like Sarah a sweet & friendly med tech who made me feel welcomed.
