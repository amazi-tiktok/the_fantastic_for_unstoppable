We set up a tee time the day before for Saturday. We traveled about 40 mins to the course. It was right off the highway into a gated golf community. Right from the start we were greeted by the staff. Upon entering the clubhouse, I was amazed at the initial set up of the course. My co-worker had to rent some clubs, at which they were very accommodating by giving him a brand new set of Nike Vapors. I had the Coverts 2.0 from the previous year and was impressed at the rentals they provided. We went to the driving range and then the putting green and we were off. Long story short, the course was AWESOME and the view was even better. We found ourselves stopping to take pictures and taking in the view (Which I rarely do on course). What I thought was to be a 6 hr round (because of our relax play at each hole) was a little over 4 hrs. This course is in my TOP 5 best courses I've played in my life, (I've played in the range of 50-60 different courses). I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys a challenge, but also a forgiving course layout. The scenic views are something out of a movie which as to the relaxation of the game of golf. If you are ever in the area, you have to check out this course.\n\nA big Thank You to the staff there at Cherokee Ridge who were some of the top notch personnel a course can have.
