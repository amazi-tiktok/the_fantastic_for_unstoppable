Recently, my toddler started having mild congestion. We immediately started with their elderberry syrup, vitamin d3, and P73 oregano oil. Aside from the congestion and mild cough he was absolutely fine. No other symptoms, no fever, and great appetite. On day 3 his breathing seemed a little off so I decided to take him in to the doctor to get him tested for RSV since it has been going around so bad and I wanted to know if that\u2019s what I was dealing with. His O2 was 98 and lungs were perfectly clear. The doctor said she highly doubted that it could be RSV because he was doing so great. His rapid test came back negative in the office. They still swabbed his throat to send to the lab and said they\u2019d call me if it came back with anything. We didn\u2019t get any treatment from the doctor and went home to continue our natural protocol. The next morning he woke up completely fine. Nothing but a small cough every once in a while. The next day I got a call from the doctor saying the throat swab was back and he was positive for RSV. They were going over treatment plans and OTC meds when I told them that he was all better. Apparently it is unusual for a child to recover so quickly and easily from RSV. I\u2019m so thankful for the products that St. John\u2019s Nutrition offers. I also feel extremely blessed to have a nutrition store with such knowledgeable and caring people to help me!

He is open and honest with you and welcomes any questions that you may have. When it became apparent that this virus would be around for a while, I contacted Dr. Matt because I knew my immune system was almost non-existent. My family physician had warned me to be extremely careful because I had many pre-existing conditions that would make it very risky for me should I become sick with the virus. In early March of this year at Dr. Matt\u2019s instructions, I began a regime of P73 Wild Oregano Oil, Vitamin D, Zinc, Drs. Immune Forte, Ultimate C, Probiotics, Elderberry Syrup and Life\u2019s Fortune Vitamins. He advised I give my immune system 6-8 weeks to become active again. I soon began to notice small changes in how I felt and one day I suddenly realized I had not used my asthma inhaler or nebulizer since starting the supplements. Normally I catch every little \u201cbug\u201d I\u2019m around and suffer from seasonal allergies and sinus issues. None of that occurred. My doctor even commended me for taking action to improve my immune system and commented how long it had been since I had been on an antibiotic or a breathing treatment. When a considerable number of people around me contracted Covid, including my husband and son-in-law, I never got sick! This was a miracle in itself. My immune system is now healthy and functioning properly thanks to Dr. Matt\u2019s sound advice and the supplements from St. John\u2019s Nutrition.

As usual with meat substitutes, you must treat it as a new kind of \"meat\" rather than compare it to actual beef. If you do this and let it stand on its own, this burger (along with other substitutes) tastes great. Next time I'm here, I want to try the jackfruit \"pulled pork\" and possibly a smoothie.

I was having a terrible day and to add to it I ran outta gas and broke down in their parking lot. I made it into a spot to safely be outta people's way and try to call around to friends and family for help. As i sit there with my boyfriend crying and breaking down hoping that someone would answer back and come to our rescue, 2 ladys approach us and ask us what we were doing. My boyfriend tries to explain we ran outta gas and broke down and we were just trying to call for help they point at a sign that says \"Herbs and More parking ONLY violators will be towed at own expense.\" And tell us \"we would hate to have you towed so you better leave before we call the tow truck.\" I instantly broke down and started balling and my boyfriend was shocked and angry at the complete lack of humanity. We managed to get our car to start up one more time to make it across the street so we didnt get towed or the law called on us for simply breaking down. These Herbs and More employees have no humamity, no heart and no compassion! If thats the kind of employees this business has then their owners should be ashamed of themselves! To see people crying and in trouble like that and be so cold and careless is terrible. Herbs and More you will NEVER have me or my families respect or business!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b1b1eef86c7:0xd8faa568d46ac191"}
