I brought my car in a week ago because the front end of the car was not driving properly. RoadMart said that they could not replicate the issue but they did see I needed my tires balanced, I let them balance my tires and when I left I was having the same issues. I brought my car back and then they said the tires were  separating on the inside, so I paid 367 for four brand new tires. Replacing the tires only helped the car drive smoother but the problem was now worse! So I brought my car back today and now there saying that the back tires are the cause of the front tires shifting and that wasn't something they could fix, I would have to take it to the dealership. The guy said he could try to align the front to see if that would help but it made the issue even worse then when I had initially brought the car in. I am now sitting here after closing hours so they can set my alignment back to were it was. I just feel like if they were unable to repair the car in the first place then they should've said so instead of me coming out of 446 dollars for no reason. I asked if I could a refund for the alignment and the guy said that he wouldn't be able to refund me, would have to wait until next call and ask for a refund or he could credited as two free oil changes which is not acceptable for my inconvenience", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293c0a719e971:0x35d4a5b6c0bf8d4a"}

He asked multiple times if it was ready, was told only 20 more mins, then 30...well 2 hours after the said time he left. We had plans at 11am, so those didn't happen WHICH could have been planned for-like loading up my kids (one being a newborn) in the car and picking him up. No apologies for the extra wait time and never honest about how long it was going to take.\nCome that following week, SURPRISE, there was an oil leak on the garage floor AND the check engine light was back on. So we took it back once again. He was told that it was just old oil coming out and it was fine and that some other piece needed to be replaced for the check engine light. Like why wasn't this fixed the first time!? Unless we got super unlucky and something went wrong within the 3/4 day time.\n\nWell now it's about 4 months later and there's still oil spots on the floor!\nSo we called today, I got a so-so person on the phone and was told to bring it back in, no \"oh my goodness! That's not what we like to hear..please bring it back in!\" It was just \"bring it back\".\n\n1st, can we make the comparison on the comment from Ashton Morgan below?? This was the SAME day, the SAME time and my husband remembers talking and waiting with Ashton.\nWe aren't very knowledgable on car repairs and we should've gotten a 2nd opinion(the Garage in Pelham is literally walking distance and everyone always has great things to say about them, but this was just for a cheap oil change-never again!) ..but we just had a baby and didn't have much spare time or sleep to decide these things with a clear mind.\n\nI just reccomend going somewhere else for piece of mind EVEN for an oil change, even if this was just a random bad day (which look at the rating-use your brains people! We didn't and now we're paying for it with our time and now a nasty driveway and garage floor) for the people working on cars, there has yet to be a verbal apology-and now if we get one it will just seem forced.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1463972408579, "text": "Dear Jennifer,\nMy name is Rick and I am the owner of Precision Tune Auto Care of Pelham.

I tell him that if the tech did his job correctly, I would not even have to be here a second time. He just says sorry.

They had the battery I wanted but the shelf date was several months old. I asked a store employee if their batteries were routinely rotated and he said they were. The employee further told me that their delivery truck would be there on Wednesday. He seemed to indicate the truck would bring newer dated batteries. I left my name and number but never got a call. The following Monday I visited the store again and spoke to the same employee. He checked and said they didn't get any newer batteries in. He said he was going to the Alexander City store that afternoon and would see if they had a newer battery. He again said he would call me either way and let me know. I confirmed that he still had the note with my name and number. And again he never called. I sent an email to AutoZone's national website regarding their lack of customer service. They replied and said that my email was being forwarded to the district manager and that I would be contacted within 24 to 48 hours. That didn't happen either.

Took my 6.0 LQ4 block, crank and heads to have them reworked, cleaned and check to see if they were still within spec limits. We discussed engine gaskets rebuild kits. I left and then called on the phone to discuss more pricing and gaskets again. I went back to stewarts to bring some more parts to be cleaned but on that visit talked again about rebuild kits and gaskets. Now each time i talked to the owner about the gasket sets i asked, were they felpro? his answer every time was yes they will be felpro. He gave me a price which was little more then what i had search online for but i decided to go with his kit since the gaskets were definitely felpro . well is snowed the next day and roads were closed so i had to wait another day for him to finish. roads were still bad so he came in late but he was finished around lunch time. So when i get there to pick up my parts i ask where is the rebuild kit. The machinist shows me the box and the gaskets sets are not felpro, they are Victor reins gaskets. I refused to buy the kit because he told me a they would contain felpro. The machinist told me that felpro and victor reins were made by the same company that they were the exact same gaskets. That was his first lie too me. Those are two entirely different companys, with different pricing and materials. so we deducted the kit and now i owe for the machine work done, which is 345.00 I pay the balance go home and start unloading the block and notice the cam bearing that they installed for me were damaged from the installation too. Took it back and the owner said he doesn't know any other way to put those bearings in. well duh!!! but you don't damage them when they go in , if you do damage them then you take them out and install new ones. but they sent me home with that crap. so i decided to look over the heads real good since things are already not good. well the heads are aluminum heads , they look as if someone took a wire brush to clean the mating surfaces on the heads. they are scratched badly. there are several scratches going across the from one cylinder to the other which will leak when it is installed back on the block. So i took the heads back to stewarts this morning and asked to talk to someone about this and the owner wasn't there but the machinist was. so i showed the head to the machinist and asked what he did to it. he said he milled it. i asked is that acceptable? he said yes. i asked if he could show me any where in writing, online or any mechanic that can tell me that those scratches on the mating surface of the head was acceptable .The machinist looked at me and said pick my head up and get the hell out of there. You can imagine what my response was. :) but I'm not happy with this and the place of business is just horrible. I have been building engines for over 23 years and i have never seen anyone tell me that scratches on a aluminum head was acceptable to install. They refused to take of this and now i have to take the heads and have them resurfaced if they can even be resurfaced again. i also heve to take the block and crank to another machine shop to have them check and correct everything stewarts touched. BEWARE SHOTTY WORK AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. STAY AWAY if you want good work performed.\n\nYour Desired Resolution:\nAt this point all i want is a complete refund for the services they performed. I tried to go back to talk to them and i was told to get the hell out of their store. The work performed was bad and i don't fell comfortable letting them touch anything else of mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cb974de7cfd5:0xb07e55d35fc40cf9"}

I returned at 1300 to get vehicle and they had not even started, nor did they apologize or try to make up for their lack of customer service. They seemed completely indifferent about not completing the job. I believe that these businesses do not consider the planning that takes place to coordinate vehicle maintenance. I understand things happen but 6 hours to complete an oil change seems reasonable. If there was going to be a problem with completing by 1300, they should have told me at 0700.

I normally avoid chain stores like Firestone because I know they try to scam people, but it was my last option to get my car examined.  I was helped by a woman I think was named Sabrina, and she fed me the biggest scam I've heard with my car, I don't think she realized I knew more about cars than she probably did.  She told me the tires were done and needed to be replaced NOW, the air filters needed replaced NOW, the battery was dead and needs replaced NOW, and the radiator needed to be flushed - and they'd conveniently do all of this for me at a hefty premium.  I was silently laughing at myself because two of my tires had 20K miles left on them (yes the other two need replacing soon), my air filters were replaced 8 months ago, my battery was brand new (I took it to auto zone AND advanced auto parts and they showed me the readings and the charge was fantastic, they laughed at Firestone for trying to pull one over on me), my radiator was also flushed within the last year.  I finally called her out on the battery and she looked me right in the eye and had the immoral audacity to say the battery was still worthless.  These are common things places like Firestone try to trick people into having repaired, because most people don't have the knowledge to know any better.  It was funny because they didn't even identify the things that were wrong with my car that I knew about.  They checked off that both headlights were working great, even though I knew and verified that one of the front headlights was dead... did they really even look my car over or just pretend to then hand me an appraisal for all the \"broken\" items I needed to have them fix now?  If you do not know much about cars, do not trust Firestone, they will sense your naivete and pull a fast one on you.  Always get a second opinion from a more reputable garage shop (I prefer privately owned places that rely on their honesty for business).  This just reaffirms the longstanding distrust I've had for places like Firestone, avoid them if you care about your money and your vehicle's longevity.

After I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the chevy dealer I found the connector was not available. I instructed your daughter to go and get a complete unit with a new pig tail. After explaining to them that a code reading would bring no results to identify the issue. I did allow the vehicle to sit in my parking lot until the problem could be addressed. Most places charge several hundred dollars to do this. Several days later they brought in a switch from a junk yard that was ripped out and badly damaged. I told them they could not use part due to being damaged. After a couple days a night time worker offered to help with diagnostics, he brought his scan tool and tried to diagnosis the issue. Found the anti-theft module was not making any connection with the vehicles pcm. He spent over an hour trying to help your daughter for free. He normally charges $70 an hour for this. We have gone out of our way to help your daughter every way we could. Including letting the vehicle sit for over a week. No way did your stand out in the cold while we laughed at her.

Wish I could give them no stars. I called and asked for 2 tires for my car, they gave me the total price for both being installed for $155.16 before taxes. I told them let's do it and to order the tires. They called me back a few hours later telling me the tires were in. I drove 30 minutes down 280 for the tires. I pulled up and they told me they would get me right in and taken cared of. I went inside for a few minutes and saw my car was up on the lift, I waited for about 15-20 minutes and noticed my car was out of the shop, so I asked them if it was finished, and waited and waited and waited, and after talking to three different people it turned out they didn't do anything to the car at all. They just pulled it into the shop lifted it up, and then lowered it and pulled it out, and never relayed the information about why they did this. When I finally got someone to talk to the guys, they said that they didn't have the tires I ordered, and I told them that they had called me and told me they did and that I have a voicemail from them stating that they did, and I played the voicemail for them, and then talked to the guy directly that left me the voicemail. So, they go and look and turns out they do have the tires after all. They pull my car back in and put the tires on, then ring me up for $211.00, and I'm like, \"I'm not paying that\", then I have to talk to the manager that's \"running\" the shop, and finally after 3 hours I get the price they told me, thank goodness I had the voicemail from them for proof, and I got out. Never. Going. Back. Maybe the most unprofessional atmosphere and experience I've ever had with a business. Truly disappointing in every way. They were also very rude to the other customers that were waiting patiently as well. They would blatantly ignore you when you'd approach them with a question about your vehicle or the situation they were putting you in. Just straight up walk past you and not say a word to you or look you in the eyes. If and when they finally did talk to you, they just mumbled their words and you couldn't understand a thing they were saying. They need to clean house, get rid of the manager and all. If not that, then just do the entire state of Alabama a favor and close up shop completely, because you're not doing any good for anyone. Like, you're not even doing your jobs, like at all. Since I left, I've actually been wondering \"what's even the point of this shop\"? The guys are all just hanging out. Finally the guy that did put the tires on my car was just some dude, that wasn't even in a uniform like the rest of the automotive crew was. He was just in some shirt and ball cap with sun glasses, so I'd at least like to thank the random guy that probably doesn't even work there that actually did the work. Maybe he was an angel or something....? If it turns out he is an actual angel and it's some kind of real miracle, it's still not worth going back for.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889166b0910fbb5:0x6f7e7664c9e1abdf"}

Now let me tell a story.....\n\nMy wife\u2019s car was giving vibrations by my own accord and felt by the look of things, balancing would fix the issue. She was due new tires but I had a month or so before committing to new set. The tires had whooped out on the back two, but good tread even in the low spot and could not be balanced.  Still safe just rough riding by my account. Ordered tires, set up an appointment with a different tire shop on Saturday,  loaded up the new tires in her car. Saturday appointment was not booked (I can\u2019t get it done) so I figure I would set up an appointment with another local shop close to work for Tuesday.\n\nMonday...\n\nMy wife calls me at 9 am with a blowed out tire. She already late. And she already told me them tires got to be changed before today.\n\n(Disclaimer.:  Her car came with no spare and I had been inactively looking for one).\n\nSo I\u2019m deep in the dog house if you didn\u2019t read between the lines.\n\nShe gets a tow to Superior Auto Care and they get after it in due time. Not unreasonable for a spur of the moment and professionally put those new tires on I already had in the truck.(I double checked and correct torque and the exact psi to spec and not \u201cnormal\u201d like most shops I have dealt with)\n\nThe question I had all morning..... was it my misjudgment and my wife is mad forever or was it a nail that even new tires could not prevent?\n\nBy all evidence from Superior Auto Care, it was a screw.  True detectives they are and me and my wife had a great week.\n\nIt was just a flat not a blow out by the pictures. she had. Her safety even by my own misjudgment would not have been compromised. But I\u2019m glad it was a screws fault and not my misjudgment.\n\nGreat guys over there. Phillip was more than helpful. Couldn\u2019t ask for better service in this situation by my wife\u2019s accord.\n\nShe got to work late, held it over my head while I didn\u2019t know if it was my fault. I committed to a lot of things I would do this week I had been putting off not knowing it was not my fault.  But, I\u2019m sitting here a happy man. Walked the dog while having conversations with my wife. Deep stuff that could have went the other direction. That is if it hadn\u2019t been for the folks at Superior Auto Care making the correct diagnosis for the problem.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862659ccdba049f:0x8e3bfd76e8007476"}

Purchased a used vehicle from this dealership in May of 2020. I was sold when I was told that my vehicle had an Auto Nation warranty of \"90 days or 4,000 miles.\" Sounds great doesn't it? Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people. These people are clearly slimy and cannot be trusted, save yourself the hassle and do not purchase a vehicle from here. Learn from my mistake, don't come here.

I went to Ford initially and they told me new tires would $1000. I thought \u201csurely I can do better than that at Sam\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWrong. I may have gotten tire and install for $600, but these mechanics DID NOT KNOW AND DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES to take the two-piece locking lug nuts from my Ford. Here are the things that transpired:\n1. First visit, didn\u2019t have but one type of tire in the size I needed. I was told to go home and order some from the website. Great, that\u2019s fine with me.\n2. Tires purchased from website did not fit my car DESPITE me typing the year, make, and model of my car onto their tire bank. Told to order another set.\n3. Order second set of tires from online, go to store to have them put on. I hang out in the store for THREE HOURS while they\u2019re \u201creplacing my tires.\u201d I finally get fed up of waiting and ask why it\u2019s taking so long, only to be told THEY HAVEN\u2019T BEEN ABLE TO GET THE LUG NUTS OFF OF MY CAR. Why wasn\u2019t I CALLED or PAGED while I sat in the store after 30 minutes of trying. I get told I need to purchase new lug nuts.\n4. $100 and 20 lug nuts later I\u2019m back at Sam\u2019s. At this point I have already paid for the tires, install, and a complete set of lug nuts ($700). Once again I go sit on the patio furniture for what I suspect to be an hour while they replace tires. 1.5 hours later I\u2019m starting to get concerned again. I go back to the tire center to see what\u2019s up, and what do you know. One tire is off and they\u2019re SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AT THE LOCKING LUG NUTS AGAIN. The mechanic proceeds to tell me that I need to go to ANOTHER TIRE STORE TO GET THEM TO CHANGE THE LUG NUTS TO THE ONES I PURCHASED. I drive across town to a tire place where they replace my lug nuts in a matter of minutes. $10.\n5. Now back to Sam\u2019s at 6:45 (tire place closes at 7:00, but the guy swears he\u2019s going to get it done today because of the trouble I\u2019ve gone through). He decides to take his dear sweet time finding an outlet to plug his phone in and check his text messages, because that\u2019s clearly vital in order to change my tires. I arrived initially at 3:00, and my tires are still not done at 7:15.\n\nI have spent, in its entirety, MORE than a work day getting my tires replaced, which when you consider costs, etc. was MORE EXPENSIVE than spending $1000 to get the dealership to replace my tires.\n\nMoral of the story: I WILL NOT be back to this location to get my tires changed ever. \u201cSave\u201d your money and go somewhere else where the mechanics are better equipped, more knowledgeable, and less lazy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ed491ad040b:0x41d575c1389f55e6"}

Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts?

I thought that was clear, but this was the second time I took this vehicle there for the same issue, the first time I was told nothing was wrong with it.

(Employee)\nDate of incident: 2/20/21 - 4:30-5:00pm.\n\n\ud83d\udd25Bought a refurbished starter from there a few years ago. Returned it because it went bad and had a warranty. Did not want to deal with another refurbished starter, so I requested a brand new one. Was told they cannot get a brand new one which is fine. So they told me I could return the defective refurbished starter I had for a refund so I can use that refund on buying a new starter from another store. At that time, that particular employee was real helpful and kind to me.\n\nThen the incident on 2/20/21 happened when I returned on that date with my defective starter. was dealing with the store manager Mike and his employee Thomas D. at the time. I was told that the starter needed to test bad in order for me to get a refund which is fine, because I had my mechanic test the starter beforehand and I recorded a video as evidence. After waiting a good few minutes because it seemed like something was wrong with the machine, the store manager Mike comes out and says that the starter tested good, but that he would still honor the refund. I told him that's fine, but the starter should have tested bad because my mechanic already tested it and I watched him test it, so I pretty much told Mike that the machine is to blame, then he got defensive and rude with his tone of voice about the machine clearly stating that the machine was not incorrect. To avoid further debating, I directly said to just do the refund. His attitude regarding the situation was unprofessional and unacceptable.\n\nWhat makes the situation even worse is the fact that the employee Thomas D. asked me for my driver's license on returning the defective starter which should not have happened, because I have my receipt. When I asked him why he's asking for my driver's license, he said they were supposed to do that on returns, but that's obviously not true. Something didn't feel right, so I called another advance Auto parts store about the situation and that store told me that advance auto of Enterprise were in the wrong for taking my driver's license. My driver's license has the address to my Mother's home because it's an old address and I am not comfortable with that address being on file because I'm protective of my mother and concerned for her safety. I do not trust people I don't know, and I definitely do not trust that advance Auto parts store anymore and ever again.\n\nThey acted very shady and I felt discriminated because I'm part Asian. I've been shopping there off and on for years for myself and for my Mother. As of now, I am no longer a customer and I want my information out of that system immediately. Yes, I got my refund, but I shouldn't have had to go through that much trouble to get it, or feel that uncomfortable. Everything that happened that day was pretty much recorded on my phone along with two eyewitnesses that were with me in case I need them for future reference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617481519561, "text": "Hello KJ, thank you for leaving your comments about your visit to our Enterprise location.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop. I wonder if this is the intent of the Meineke representative who gave this card to my son's mother?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622217384048, "text": "Hi Tom, this should never be the impression we leave.

They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr.

I travel with my job and always would stop at this location when I needed an oil change, battery, wiper blades and much much more.  The last time I was there the technician scared me in to spending over $800 in repairs that have never  been an issue before on a car that I bought new couple years ago.  I thought I would try them again, I just called for a quote on breaks, I explained all I needed was break shoes, and would like a  quote.  The man I was talking to told me to bring it in.  Again I said I just need a quote, he told me he could not give me a quote with out bringing it in for inspection.  I will never use Meineke again, that is how they lure you in, you take your car/truck there for something and before you leave they scare you to death saying something else is life or death.  I just wanted a quote on brakes..... Needless to say Budget Brakes (2 doors down from Meineke) was glad to give me a quote and has now put the breaks on my Nissan Altima.
