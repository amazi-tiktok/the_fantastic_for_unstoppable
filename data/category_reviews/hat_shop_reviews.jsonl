As soon as we walked in the store, the manager said, \"The most inexpensive boot we have is $125.\"  Not hello, hi, how are you; you know, like normal people. I replied, \"Excuse me?\" He repeated the statement. I said, \"What did you just say?!\" He repeated the statement!\nI was offended. He did not greet us but instead made this derogatory and disparaging statement. I guess my son and I did not look like we BELONGED in his store.  My eleven year old son asked to see the expensive shoes. The most expensive shoe in the store was thousands of dollars and IF I WANTED TO SIR, I could have purchased that boot right then and there! So watch how you speak and treat people. You know that status of no one that walks in that store, sir. Against my better judgment, I allowed my son to purchase a Stetson hat he really liked, he loves cowboy hats. I still kick myself for even allowing him to buy that hat! I let my son handle the transaction by himself. I was on the other side of the store but believe me I was all eyes and ears. He then asked my son if the money he pulled out of his pocket($100 bill) was birthday money. My son replied, \" No, this is hard work money.\" What?! Is this how you entreat customers, sir? I was very upset that we were treated like this. Then he went on to tell my son how to handle the hat. My son could have had a collection of these hats! But he did not bother to ask, he assumed my son had never had an expensive hat \"like that\" ($65\ud83d\ude44) and didn't know what to do with it. Sir, you were way out of line! I pray you correct your spirit and not treat others like you treated me and my son. But then again, I am so sure you do not treat EVERY customer like this, only the ones you cast judgment on because they don't  LOOK LIKE they can afford your merchandise. Get real! I started to come back in your store today and tell you personally how you offended us, but OTHERS NEED TO KNOW. Sir, it appears that the only thing needing a STAMPEDE is your condescending, prejudice and pernicious spirit. \ud83d\ude0c", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a08e0f8543:0xf552b11be6897aa7"}
