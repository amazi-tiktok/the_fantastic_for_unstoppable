I also got my eyelash extensions done by her and 3 weeks has passed and they\u2019re still perfect. I moved back from Michigan 2 years ago and had paid for about 5 different full set lashes and I\u2019m never pleased with the work. But let\u2019s be real, I\u2019m not taking time out of my day for nothing. To be good at your job is one thing. To have a great personality, to make a stranger feel comfortable, to have patience to listen and correct any little concern even when you\u2019re scheduled for a small time frame, to having a clean and unique work space, down to communication and friendliness/responsiveness. I know people are busy but if I\u2019m trying to spend a thousand dollars for your services, sometimes I do think your time is the least you could give me. Jackie has it all and these days that is a rarity. I highly recommend her for any service she does because she really does care about her clients and whether they walk out happy with the services they\u2019ve received. She\u2019s a gem and I\u2019m so lucky I\u2019ve found her!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590107660129, "text": "Wow! I am blown away. Thank you so much for this!

This was the worst experience I have ever had and I wanted to make sure that I processed this best I could before sharing.\n\nI eloped with my now husband on March 7th 2020. It wasn\u2019t anything crazy, really just exchanging vows with my husband in front of our closest friends and family. When I booked the appointment, I was so excited. I had seen her work, loved it, and was so excited for her to do my makeup on my most special day!\n\nI am not a big makeup person. I love how it looks, but I don\u2019t care for the money, time, effort that comes with makeup, so I only play with it for super special occasions. I took my best friend and my cousin with me to get it done (both of them love makeup, so I knew that they would tell me if they felt something could look better).\n\nFrom the moment we stepped inside I was uncomfortable. I was not made to feel like this was such a special day. Jackie (I believe that was her name, she never introduced herself, so I\u2019m not 100% sure that\u2019s her name) from the beginning made me feel awful about myself.\n\nThe first red flag was me showing her what I wanted. She criticized what I wanted and basically made me feel like it was \u201ctoo much\u201d. I knew it wasn\u2019t, I don\u2019t even wear makeup and I knew that it wasn\u2019t over the top. Not to mention, I hate over the top makeup, so...\nWe moved passed this and she started my makeup.\n\nThe second comment that was made was about my eyebrows. My eyebrows are naturally thick and I typically don\u2019t do much to them. She started to fill them and asked if I fill them. I let her know that I did sometimes, but I like the fuller eyebrow look. She then said \u201cDo you get these done ever? Do you pluck or wax or anything?\u201d I told her that I did sometimes, but moderately. She said, \u201cWell, can I shape them or something cause otherwise my work is all for nothing.\u201d I wanted to burst into tears. It\u2019s my wedding day, I\u2019m already balls of nerves and now my eyebrows are awful apparently. Yes, I allowed her to shape them and she did do a good job on them once they were finished. I took a deep breath and told myself, \u201cit\u2019s gonna be so worth it!\u201d\n\nThe third issue was when she started to add a primer to my face. In between my eyes, on the bridge of my nose, she said \u201cWow, you\u2019re so dry. Did you moisturize?\u201d I had, but I do struggle with that area on my face being dry. At this point, I didn\u2019t think I could hold my tears. Her body language was obvious that she did not like me and she just wanted to hurry me out. She was incredibly loud in my face while she was doing my makeup. She was talking to someone doing hair in the other room and other women that were down the hall. She went into her closet to grab a product and one tear fell and hit my lap. I dried it, she came back and started to continue doing my makeup.\n\nAfter, she started to do my eyeshadow, she didn\u2019t exactly follow what I wanted, but it was close enough and I was so over it. She did my face, and it truly did look good. The airbrush makeup look was exactly what I wanted and made me feel bridal, so I was really thankful that turned out.\n\nOnce my entire face was done, she asked about lip. I asked for a nude color (I am mixed with black and white for reference). She gave me a bright purple pink color and at this point, I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I said it looked great, I just wanted to go to my car and cry and have my friends attempt to fix it.\n\nI was charged $150 for the worst makeup service I\u2019ve ever had. I also tipped so my total out the door was $180. Almost $200 later and I cried almost the whole way back to start getting ready for my WEDDING DAY (please don\u2019t forget that this was my one and only wedding day).\n\nMy friend fixed my makeup while I got my hair done and it ended up being wonderful once she fixed it. We ran out and bought the lipstick color I asked for (nude) and I ended up being satisfied. I wish I could get every dime of my money back, but I can\u2019t. This experience was horrid and I highly recommend that you steer clear.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591465564291, "text": "Kiana, I am very sorry that you had a negative experience with me. My intention is to make every single one of my clients feel absolutely beautiful, and that was certainly my intention with you as well. I do ask questions to all of my clients about dry (or oily) skin, brow shaping, color preferences, etc because everyone has different preferences, and I want to make sure that each client loves their look. I agree that your eyes, brows, and foundation looked absolutely flawless, and I\u2019m so glad you loved it. However I am incredibly sorry that you didn\u2019t like your lip color, and would have loved to have corrected that for you if you would have let me know.  You are absolutely beautiful, and you were a beautiful bride. I loved working with you on your wedding day, and I\u2019m incredibly sorry that I didn\u2019t make you feel the way I intended to make you feel.

Recently the student was unfamiliar with highlighting and caused the lightener to \u201cbleed\u201d causing an intense and distinctly different contrast to show up on the root and parted portion of hair. They tried to fix the problem by toning this portion. By toning the hair I no longer had highlights in this portion leaving the hair a reddish dark color on the root in contrast to the blond. They offered to provide additional highlights on another visit but I would still have to pay for the lightener. I was told $13. The next time I came within 7 days to have the lightener done to fix the toned area without highlights. It became apparent the learning leaders only add a small amount of lightener to each extra bowl needed to lighten so they can up charge $13 per bowl. I have noticed this in the past. This time I was charged for 3 bowls. The instructor said these extra bowls were not necessary, however the instructor allowed the student to use this amount. In addition to the bleeding mistake that occurred the previous time without proper supervision, I was disappointed by the poor customer service given by the instructors and poor business strategy taken by charging the customer for a mistake that was done under the lack of care by the learning leader.

We appreciate your honest feedback and you're absolutely right-we are a school! Our students are all at different levels of skill based on several factors including, but not limited to, length of time they have been in the program and the specific areas in which they excel. You may not have known this, but we have a 100% guarantee and you can always let us address any issues you might have had with your service. Students work on guests because they need the hands-on experience which is part of their curriculum. Students aren't ready for the salon until they have completed their program, hours, and have taken both their written and state board exams. They are then ready to transition to an actual salon. We also have students who are in a program here we call Phase 2. These students must pass an interview and hands-on assessment in makeup, cutting, color and texture. These \"master level\" students are available upon request and you'll be getting a more advanced, driven student that is much further along in their program. However, these services do cost a bit more. All that being said, we have to remember that we are a school, first and foremost. We love being able to offer extremely low (much lower than an actual salon) prices for our guests because our students need the hands-on experience. We can all remember the first time we tried to accomplish something...sometimes it was great, but sometimes we also had a lot to learn from the experience. But with practice and patience, we got so much better than when we started and that's exactly how it is for our students. We hate that you weren't happy with your hair, but we do appreciate the time you gave our student in letting them perfect their craft."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

Chelsea Loeb has scarily moved on to jeopardize the business, \"Sola Salon Studios (a.k.a.Vanity Hair Studio at Sola Salons), but EVERYONE should be warned!!!! 2&1/2months now My hair had teal/green streaks that was NEVER requested & now the streaks are fading to a rusty color. She said she would fix her mistake & ceased communication when the messages clearly showed \"Read\". Original hair plan, ALL OVER blue/black \"PERMANENT\" hair color. Then Chelsea spoke of some \"Pre-lightening\" streaks. Wasn't too sure what that was, but entrusted she knew what she was doing since I told her my \"Original\" hair plan. 1st Salon appt, 4/23/18, Chelsea only touched up grey roots on top half of head & \"Pre-lightened\" streaks & dyed them teal/green!! I asked for ALL OVER permanent hair color, not just partial roots, & did NOT ask for TEAL/GREEN! Chelsea then processed a 3rd color on my hair within 3 hours, to cover up her first mistake. After 3+ hours there, it was supposedly \"fixed\". Knew it wasn't, but after 3 hours, I was done. Reached out to her the next morning, 4/24/18, to have it fixed before our beach trip the following day, 4/25/18. Chelsea then supposedly applied a \"permanent\" all over color, what she called a blue \"Fantasy Color\", & was told to rarely wash my hair so the color wouldn't fade. I know enough about hair color that a \"permanent process\" should not \"wash out\" in showers. Unfortunately my nightmare came true. Ruined friend's linens we visited whilst on beach trip. Couldn't swim in Resort pool or at beach because blue was pouring out in showers & is was \"washing out\" 38 days later. I paid for \"Permanent\" color, not \"wash out\". Returned from beach trip & respectfully asked her for a refund on 4/30/18, since what I paid ($135) for was not remotely done. Chelsea replied, \"Unfortunately we don't issue refunds since the time & product spent...\" So I asked for it to be fixed \"again\" since I did not ask for the teal/green that's showing again since her 3rd color is \"washing out\". The same day, 4/30/18, Chelsea agreed she would once she returned from her beach trip. 5/7/18, I asked her what brand of \"Fantasy Color\" did she use so I can figure out how to get this color out for good for I was tired of ruining my own towels & linens. She replied the same day with \"Pulp Riot\", but didn't offer any other advice, considering she messed up my hair. Of course I followed thru and researched the product, only to find out that it \"Washes out in 42 washes...\". As stated before, I paid $135 for a \"Permanent\" hair color process. That same day 5/7/18, I asked if she could fit me in the following week to correct her mistake. No reply. One week later, 5/14/18, I messaged again to see if she can get me in next week. Still no reply. Most insulting is that the messages let you know once they've been read & Chelsea has \"read\" them, and still no reply. I don't want her touching my hair in fear she will ruin it more. I just want my refund so I can go elsewhere that's more professional & knowledgeable to fix HER mistake. Insult to injury were her Facebook posts during the 2 weeks I was requesting her to fix her mistake. She was clearly telling the Facebook public that she had openings. Why not reply to my requests to fix her mistakes?! Filed a BBB complaint May 14, 2018, & she had until May 31,  to respond. No reply. Then had 10 days to respond. No communication until 2nd BBB letter. My pictures and her complete disregard of her own negligence is proof enough on her lack in professionalism and customer service & is UNacceptable! Still \"UNresolved\"!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzpuxeK1gKssill30F3zN2G-Vu3eYqb4mNG5h6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDP-mppzw37dZ0_jO53RTTaf6ETiF1xH088V-P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY_jlo02Pe3p6jsETwL8_LwpU3GCuNX1oRZwa-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrTi10Ft7_pp91jPWI_GO_REM10mflIC8RDyWE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvYQuRQbXJunDGWzIDFkl5Tn98OCydO_Tg9qBk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTHb-dWVDmJ70hk86S4yIqe8WP5RjxJ30O7ClE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZM15k8yFZxsd4HvWduJPdx4TPRk1P8aNjHhg8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuMtwTAsXF_yhNv-PxzU5uRLJsykaK0K_JB2ju=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ccbcb1ea25f:0xb4e505e0d474933f"}

I will return, but with more salon price educated.I wanted to be a deep red color, and it was achieved in 3 hrs. The only thing that I found upsetting after I was sooo very \ud83d\ude0a with the hair, was the total! $600!! Now,  the total shouldn't be a mystery while you are getting it done. It should be discussed about how much it will be when you are describing what you want to the stylist while she is evaluating your hair. And if its too high, then a different affordable approach. I'm not educated in this field, so I have no idea what steps have to be taken or how much those steps are, such as the $150/ hr. that I was charged. I was told differently on the appt. call. That was all the cash I had, barely enough to tip\ud83d\ude12.

Please have your sister contact us directly. Every lash removal is charged for a lash removal. There has never been a time when our lash artists have approved not being paid for their time to remove a client\u2019s lashes. I would like to speak with her so I can find out who misconstrued that information to her to cause such confusion as both of our Guest Experience Experts that handle scheduling, know that it is a service that always costs since it requires proper training and techniques to not compromise the client\u2019s natural lashes.\n\nThere a multitude of factors that go into lashes not lasting long. And in this case, your sister, I\u2019ll withhold her name too for the reasoning you stated, was informed for the beginning that she had short natural lashes - and going as long as she wanted to go could lessen the amount of time they would last. Getting them wet at all within 24 hours and proper at home protocols not being followed will also shorten the time.\n\nAll of this is explained at the appointment as well as some of it is notated on the waiver signed in the beginning of the appointment.\n\nAgain, please have your sister contact us directly so we discuss ways we can properly rectify this situation with her. Thanks!\n\n***edited to add: I see she was already refunded a FULL refund for her full set 4 days ago. I\u2019m not sure what else we can do to rectify this situation more than we have.

I did tie it down everyday. Didn\u2019t exercise. The ponytail broke in half after 3 days and the swoop moved everyday. The stylist Kierra put glue all over the bundle so, I can\u2019t reuse it.

The paper work that you signed at the beginning of your service, explains that if you are unsatisfied with your hair, your stylist will be more than happy to come up with an arrangement to get your hair where you would like it to be. We truly wish you would have come to us first so we could evaluate your hair and make it right for you without the additional costs of another salon. We have offered for you to come in and have us take a look at your hair to evaluate the situation, and we are sorry that you did not want to come in to work this out. Unfortunately, due to the time your stylist spent with you, product used, and not having the opportunity to evaluate your hair in person, we are unable to refund you for this service. Upon reviewing your paper work, your stylist noted that your hair would need more than one service to achieve the end results that you were wanting. This is due to the fact that your hair was already previously lightened at home before your visit to us. We are always striving for what's best for our clients. In this circumstance, your hair wouldn't be able to handle any further lightening in one visit. It is our understanding that in order to protect the integrity of your hair, you and your stylist decided to go with a darker blonde until your next service. We aren't quite sure what happened between the time you left the salon and now, but after your service you told us that you loved your hair and even booked your future reservation with us. We deeply value you as a customer of ours and we are sorry to see you go. We appreciate your review and we hope you have a wonderful day."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a61f96ea20655:0x14238b725edd250"}
