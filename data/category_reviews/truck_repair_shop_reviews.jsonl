She said they already had the order put in. The lady at Hanks was so rude.  They were talking about us and saying he muted it but it was not. I have it all recorded. The lady at Hanks said it will be $325 to pick it up because Geico said to leave it in their lot which they did not. So Geico told her she was having someone come pick it up and give payment. 1 hour later they said they were closing and that someone could get it Monday Morning.  The guy from Geico that schedule the pickup on Thursday said wow that was the worst customer service I have ever had. And now I see what he is talking about.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They are crooks. They did that just to get extra money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88897db96788dee1:0x114d8b6e5cb6aaab"}

The tow truck the police called out to pick my truck were nice and quick, But when they asked where I wanted them to take it to, they seemed a little bit annoyed that I wanted it to go to my home, as I wanted to talk with my insurance agent first. I suppose they prefer taking them to their place or a body shop.\nWhen they unloaded my truck, a good bit of the plastic from the headlight and grill fell out on the tow truck, And the driver just brushed it off into my yard where my truck was sitting. I didn't think much of it, I'd just clean it up in the morning when I went out to take pictures to start working with my insurance.\nI talked to my insurance, They told me because it's a newer model truck,  That they would have someone from their salvage provider come pick it up, I believe it was 3 days later when I got a call from a lady from IIA or IAA, saying that she was about to be giving a driver the information to come pickup my truck and verified my address and the damages with me.\nNot too terrible long after I spoke with her and said ok to having another tow truck company come out, Joey actually called me when he was roughly 30 minutes away from my home to verify my address and that everything was ready to go. He showed up just as he said and came to the door and got me to explain why he was there, And actually gave me the rundown on the process of what would happen if progressive did or did not total my truck. I handed off my keys to him, He went and got  his truck from the street and backed it in to where he'd be able to load it up. Before he backed up into the location, he did ask me if I had septic in the area (I I didn't)  He said he always asks when he has to enter a yard,  Said he's never had a problem with accidentally finding a tank but really didn't want to have to make phone calls explaining a problem!  LOL!\nHe got down under my truck and did his work with some chains, Put it in neutral to wind it up his truck and chain it down. Now, this is where I became surprised,  He picked up every piece of plastic and debris that had come from my truck and put them in the bed. I never asked him to!\nI asked why he did and he said he wanted it to be just as if he and my injured truck were never there. I'm still amazed that there a people that have that mindset.\nWe talked for a few more minutes as he finished loading and chained my truck down, I asked where they were out of and he gave me a business card with everything on it. I'm in Chilton county, So it's not feasible for me to call a company that's an hour plus away,  But he told me that you have trucks all over the place at any given time, And to call if I needed help, That you might be right down the street!\nAs I said early on, I never thought that my best experience in this headache would have been the guy that picked up my truck and towed from my home to Progressive's auction yard. It ended up being totaled,  But I'm loving my new blue f150!\nThank you to Joey and Hank's!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580148883770, "text": "That is so amazing to hear, Brian!

They accepted the job and didn't call/notify/cancel the job to give my Dad the opportunity to get another company assigned to the job, they just left him stranded!!! Then, my husband called them last night and they accepted his request for a tow directly,no AAA,  he called them himself since they were close. They told him they would be there in no more than 45 minutes. 1 hour later, no word. He calls them back, they say they took another job and would get him as soon as they finished. 3 HOURS LATER, my husband is still stranded and calls them for the third time. They end up telling him he may be better off calling another company. God forbid what would have happened or how long my husband would have waited if leaving it up to them to follow up on a service they accepted to begin with. Y'all are clearly in the wrong business, and people can be seriously hurt or have personal things in their life that an be SEVERELY affected by your negligence and lack of consideration. Thank God they weren't on their way to work or something pressing that required a timely arrival. Lesson learned. I will be sure to let AAA know to never assign this business to my tow jobs again, and I would recommend the same to all of you, unless you want yourself and loved one's to be stuck out in the middle of the night with no help or in the blistering Alabama heat.

I provided the part. I picked it up Monday. I could not leave because the battery was dead. Never had that problem before. RED FLAG.\n\nThe mechanic there said something ridiculous to me about all the car batteries in their lot going dead since the hailstorm, or something to that effect. I guess I'm a stupid woman and would just accept that ludicrous statement as truth. RED FLAG. He jumped me off quickly, and left me there with my hood up. ANOTHER RED FLAG.\n\nThen we figure it out. My boyfriend noticed my brake lights were not going off. There were pieces of one of my brake light stopper in my floorboard. The other stopper is just missing. These are the parts that keep your brake lights off until you hit the brake.\n\nSo now my brake lights were draining my battery. I had no issues with my brakes or battery when I left it with them. The truck obviously had made it to their lot after the repair, but then the battery died. Any person with half a brain can see what happened here.\n\nI contacted the owner, who defended his techs, but offered to \"fix\" this problem IF IT REALLY HAPPENED. Unfortunately I do not trust this shop to touch my vehicle at this point. I have not even driven it enough to know if the crank shaft pulley was installed correctly because I am waiting on brake stoppers from Nissan.\n\nHe seemed angry that I would question his \"integrity\"... WELL WHY WOULDN'T I?\n\nSo $113 later, my two cents: Save yourself the hassle. I was married to a mechanic for 24 years... and some of them do this to women who they assume will not know any better, so they will bring their vehicle back to be \"fixed\".... It's not surprising to me that these guys have a \"Ladies Day\" ... I bet they get a lot of repeat business. I did notice among all their suspicious 5 star reviews the few who did have a complaint were also women. Maybe they assume we need a man to TALK to a mechanic. Or they think people like me will see that they are \"Christian\" business and expect them to NOT SCREW ME over. I am a single mom with a son on disability... and I cannot trust the vehicle they just \"fixed.\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889ca63618357b1:0x4f1e943cd82d8238"}

As you all know, many businesses won't even take the time to contact a lost customer.  Marc not only reached out but followed up with us to confirm we were taken care of, even though we had to pull our truck.  He made no excuses and stated that the communication errors were taken seriously and will be addressed.  Ultimately our repair had to been completed elsewhere but Williams still followed up and showed accountability.  I would be comfortable continuing to use W.W. Williams as I have at various locations.  However, I would advise that you seek assistance from Management if communication is lacking.  I wish we had done so sooner.\n\nBe aware that every experience isn't the same.  We had a truck towed in to this location due to the good reviews and communication with the tech on our call.  We were told that our truck would be looked at first thing the following day.  Day 1, truck not looked at, we were told someone went home sick.  This was after we called to get an update.  We were told it would be looked at the following a.m.\nDay 2,  I we provided the potential location of the issue after speaking with our home mechanic.  We asked how pics could be sent to get things rolling.  We emailed a pic of the part and diagnostic which was from a recent repair of another unit with the same problem.  We followed back up after not hearing anything mid day.  The truck was not looked at by mid-day we were told this time 2 people were out.\nDay 3, Calls and face to face contact again resulted in no action, the truck was not looked at.\nDay 4, We went to location to try to nail down a realistic expectation of when the truck would be touched.  We were told they would try by late afternoon but could not say for sure, this came from advisement with the shop supervisor.\n\nThis has been the worst experience we have had with a WW Williams which we use often locally.  Our confidence in towing the truck was due to the quality of work and professionalism we experienced in the past.  This location has not met the standard exemplified by the WW Williams name.  Truitt has not followed up with us nor provided a realistic time table to address the misinformation provided prior to the town in.  We understand staff issues occur, especially in the current pandemic climate.  However, there is no excuse for not providing updates nor treating all customers with the same level of priority.  The business is open, there are technicians present, and trucks being worked on.  Yet, we have not been serviced nor updated with an expected diagnostic date.  The cost of being out of service has been extended due to the poor service standard.  Beware before taking your truck here.

AAA got us in touch with W. W. Williams. I described our problem over the phone to W. W. Williams. The front seal was leaking badly, our transmission was functioning normally as long as it had fluid in it, however was leaking too rapidly to drive. The mechanic on call nearly insisted that he come out and have a look at it on site, however I told him there was nothing that could be done on the side of the road. We decided we would spend the night on the side of the road and have it towed to W. W. Williams the next day.\n\nThe next day we had the RV towed to W. W. Williams. The mechanic on call insisted that we let him come out and put the RV inside the gates, even though we were not worried about it as it was a very industrial area. The mechanic came out and was nice and spent about 10 minutes installing the driveshaft since it had been removed by the towing company. We again explained and showed him the problem and he assured us that it would be no big deal for them to repair. The shop was very nice and appeared to be well equipped. The mechanic estimated 8-10 hours labor for the repair. He waited another 20 minutes for our ride home to arrive and we left.\n\nA few days later W. W. Williams called to say that they could not repair our RV. They said that since it was leaking from the front seal, they wouldn't have the tooling. They charged $600 to tell us this, which is very upsetting because I told them that was what the problem was from square one and several more times after that. They justified their price by a minimum 4 hour charge for the guy to meet us to put it behind the gate, and then a inspection fee on top of that to glance underneath the camper. Their seasoned mechanic should have been able to make that call right away, and charging for an inspection is ridiculous as this could and should have been done by the mechanic while we were paying for his 4hr service call, he had plenty of time for that as he was with us for an hour or less. The tooling is also a very lame excuse.\n\nThis company clearly took advantage of us, and figured they could make an easy profit without having to touch our RV. Life is expensive enough as it is, we don't need to gouge each other. I am really upset that I told them our problem from the very beginning and they still put us through all of this.\ncall right awaycl", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e82757537d6dd:0x704f734fd94a65f7"}

Worked all day until 4 am trying to fix my truck bcuz my driver was under a load. Checked my boxes and saw they both was low in gear oil. Topped them off and told me I had a yoke seal leak and a drive axle leak. Didn\u2019t charge me for the oil he put in my truck. Cut down the price so I could get everything fixed bcuz he didn\u2019t want me having problems down on the road. Sent pictures of all the malfunctioning parts and sent pictures of the new parts once installed. Called and texted the next day to make sure everything was going fine. Charged me less than what I would\u2019ve got charged anywhere else knowingly bcuz my money was funny due to me just paying  to get my motor rebuilt by another mechanic.

Couldn\u2019t hear any leaks, couldn\u2019t see anything, disconnected air dryer lines and bypassed the dryer still no air pressure, checked air compressor for air pressure it was fine. After calling 3 other places, one of them said they were on the way two different times and never showed up, another one showed to be located in Decatur but when the mechanic called he said it was at least a 45 minute drive from Cullman for $270. plus their hourly rate, third one didn\u2019t have anyone to make road calls as their ad stated. So, then I called these guys, they were there in approximately 20 minutes, not one mechanic but two and one was actually the owner. They didn\u2019t waste any time from start to finish. As I started telling the issue, what I had checked and done, they started looking and checking themselves as I talked, after checking the things that would normally cause the problem, one mechanic started checking lines, then went underneath truck and started from the front within 10 or 15 minutes he decided to take the air from their service truck and the owner called the shop for another mechanic to run them a cut off valve so they could fill the air tank and release the valve and fill the lines quickly so the problem would show up, since it was bad enough that it wasn\u2019t letting any air build up enough to be heard. The leak showed right up as soon as the valve was opened. These guys were great!!! Smart, quick, polite and didn\u2019t act like I was just some dumb lady which I tend to get a lot of out here on the road. Also, the owner didn\u2019t try to take advantage of me or drain my wallet dry.\nIf I ever break down near Decatur or have problems I\u2019ll be calling them right off the bat, no hesitation period.

Garretts accepted from me in March 2018 a check for the sum of a little over $18,000.00 for a rebuild on my 2012 Peterbuilt. Was given a 12 month warranty on engine but at 14 months and 127,000 miles later my engine went down. I had it towed to a shop for inspection of fault. Mechanic told and showed me the two head bolts nearest the fire wall that were not torqued properly. I paid their price for rebuild but did not receive in return what I paid for because head bolts that are \u201cproperly \u201c torqued do not just back off. I don\u2019t know to many people that can pay over $18,000.00 for something and do not receive in return what they paid for and stay in business long after. Praise God , I am still in business by only His Grace but maybe in the future your mechanics can focus on doing it right the first time instead of bad mouthing other mechanics in your area.

My husband and I are fulltime RV'ers so our RV is our home and my husband travels for work. So when we found out that our exhaust manifold was cracked we needed someone quickly. So without proper research we took it to these guys. They gave us a crazy estimate but was told that it was JUST an estimate, that it really depended on how hard the exhaust manifold was to remove and if any bolts broke as they were removing it. We dropped it off on a Thursday morning at 8:00 a.m. On Monday at noon my husband was informed that the parts were still not in. Then on Monday at 4:00 p.m. my husband was told that it was ready to be picked up. Since we were over an hour away we told them we would pick it up on Tuesday. My husband was also told that the final bill was $2,990.00. WHAT??? We were flabbergasted because they had told my husband that the exhaust manifold came off easy and that no bolts had broken. My husband talked to the service manager and disputed the bill but the service manager would not budge so in order to get our RV back we had to pay it. Then I did my research and talked to several other diesel mechanics and also talked with some other freightliner and cummins mechanics and was told that they seriously overcharged us for the work that is shown on the bill. The bill states the following \"Pulled unit in shop. removed turbo and exhaust manifold. Cleaned the head and the turbo. Installed and torqued new exhaust manifold and turbo with all new gaskets and bolts. Cleaned inside and out. Ran unit. Checked for leaks none found. Parked unit.\" They charged us $175.00 an hour and claimed 14 hours worth of work for a total labor cost of $2,450.00. No mention of any problems whatsoever in removing the exhaust manifold. In my talks with other diesel mechanics I was quoted anywhere from $1,200.00 to at the most (from another freightliner mechanic) $125.00 an hour for labor. And that it should not have taken 14 hours to do the job if there had been no problems. Another mechanic I spoke with said that if the parts were not there at noon but it was finished at 4:00 then it took them at the most 4 hours to \"install and torque the new manifold and turbo with all new gaskets and bolts. Clean inside and out. Run unit. Check for leaks and park the unit.\" That would leave 10 hours for them to remove the exhaust manifold and that is overboard, especially since there were no issues in removing it. I was given some great advice and I am pursuing this. I was told that in order to hold the Freightliner name that they have to abide by a \"Labor Guide\" and to ask to see it (but we had already paid and picked the RV up so I was too late in doing that) so I have requested the labor guide requirements for this type of job. I have also requested quotes from other diesel mechanics based on what they said they did via the bill. And have contacted the main Freightliner offices. It is sad that we as consumers can not completely trust that we won't be screwed when we take our property to people.\nOn top of all of the above, when we were ready to leave my husband asked for the key and lo and behold they had lost it. They could not find the key to our RV. Really?? What kind of business that works on vehicles loses keys? It was a good thing that we had another key with us. I would recommend to do your research before you make a quick decision like we did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602110a7b0ed1:0xc685b4618fec7c7e"}

They are liars and thieves. My husband went to work for WTI in Alabama. Their repair shop is in cahoots with the Freightliner in the same town of Tuscaloosa. Just after a 90 day inspection my husband switched to WTI. They immediately on first day said there he needed over 6000.00 in repairs on his truck. We had no choice st the moment but to get it repaired where he could start work. Freightliner started repair on it. Finished it in THREE WEEKS!! So my husband was out of work for over 4 weeks due to this scam. After he was up & running again here in Pensacola we had to put it in the shop at Freightliner. After a week they found out that none of the parts had been replaced or were either old parts. It took another week to get it approved to not have to pay for the parts and labor on what was done! Then the manager in Pensacola found out that the Work was not even done by a licensed Mechanic in Tuscaloosa!!  Then of course the Pensacola Freightliner found some more things wrong of course. Like they always do. Sigh * we were out of work over 6 weeks due to this. I contacted the owner of the three Freightliner owned by him. One in Tuscaloosa and two in Atlanta area. He wouldn\u2019t call me back at all. If we had had the money and time we would\u2019ve had an attorney. Stay away from WTI in Tuscaloosa & FREIGHTLINER in Tuscaloosa.

We came from the Houston area where we were used to parts being accessible more quickly, so this wait time may be normal for the Mobile area. The pickup experience was a bit frustrating. I picked up on a Saturday and waited 1 hour 15 minutes to get checked out (was told the car was ready but paperwork had to be done). The service rep kept getting pulled away by walk-ins, phone calls, and I'm not sure what else, but it seemed I kept getting bumped to the back of the line.

We almost made the deal twice. After making our down payment and payment requirements very clear, the sales persons involved went to get approval. When they returned, the vehicle had been discounted, but they added a \"fee.\" That's the only thing he would say, \"a fee.\" They were trying to deliberately be vauge and, in our opinion, dishonest. After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have. Avoid Greenway Honda in Florence, AL, and Greenway Chevy in Muscle Shoals, AL, if you are planning to make a deal on a used car. They are not to be trusted unless you have the cash to pay up front or your own financing.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620053636252, "text": "LJ, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.

I took my car to Kia because my air wasn\u2019t working they kept my car for a day and a half. I got my car back the air was working fine. I didn\u2019t pay anything. About a week later I went back in for my follow up appointment because I was informed to bring the car back so they could check my Freon levels. I took the car back and the rep that car up to me informed me it would be 139.00 for a diagnostic reading. I got upset because if you charge to do a diagnostic reading why wasn\u2019t that service performed the first time. I ended up getting a phone call back from a guy named Jaizon, that apologized about my previous encounter with the pricing and he informed me I wasn\u2019t supposed to pay anything for the diagnostic fee.  I took my car back to the dealership and left it. A few hours later I get a phone call from a totally difference representative that tells me I\u2019m going to have to pay 280 dollars for them to figure out what\u2019s wrong with my car. I informed them to have my car ready for me to pick it up then five minutes later the same rep called me back and stated they would knock 100 dollars off of the 280 to make it 170 for the diagnostic fee. I\u2019ve gotten literally four prices for simply finding out what\u2019s wrong with my car. I\u2019ve wasted my time, and gas by making trips up there that was a complete waste of time! I\u2019ve gotten more lies and inaccuracy from this company than any other company in Huntsville thus far. And I\u2019ve only been in Huntsville about 2 years. They will NEVER have to worry about me bringing my car there again. That\u2019s for sure! Giving them one star is too much credit, I wish I could remove it too!!!

Wish I could give them 5 stars because that would mean I had a great experience. But buyers BEWARE of the management here. If you buy a used car or happen to get a lemon, you may be in for a huge headache. I bought a used vehicle on Friday, 2/19, and on Monday 2/22 I already had it being looked at by my mechanic. This was AFTER I tried to get management to respond. Vehicle's fuel pump wasn't working, and Stivers said DO NOT tow it to our place because we don't work on Rams. My mechanic found out that the fuse box had been heavily rigged to send extra juice to a failing fuel pump, just enough to get it to run. He said that this was easy to spot once they looked at it, meaning that Stivers doesn't check out the vehicles well enough. I have tried, repeatedly, to get them to return my call and talk to me about the issue, hoping they will at least acknowledge it. And additional $2000 later I've got the van back, but NO thanks to Stivers. My mechanic, on the other hand, is going to get the SECOND Google review I've ever written, and it will be 5 stars.\n\nAs of the date of this review, we are just a month past the date I bought the van, and I still have not heard from them. This was after my salesperson and the manager BOTH said he would get back in touch with me. They have three different phone numbers, and not a single message or call has been made. I will keep trying, and I hope that someone in their marketing group will see this and get back with me. I'm hoping there has been some minor miscommunication there and that I will get some assistance and help covering the expenses soon.

He told me that given the details, there would be no reason they couldn\u2019t get me in another vehicle. I left work 30 minutes early to get their and it was the BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME. Sales people Eddie and CJ got the details that Seth already had and it took them five minutes to come out to the lot that had very little inventory to let me know that they couldn\u2019t help me. What\u2019s interesting about this is that I tried to do business with them late last year and had a totally different set of circumstances at that point. I was told that I would have to do the same thing they told me last year when I was in a different set of circumstances. Just go to another dealership.

I drove 2 hours to the dealership to look at a used van.  When I arrived I noticed that the van had a rear liftgate which prohibits the installation of the ladder rack I was going to add to it.  I told them it wouldn\u2019t work for me, then inquired about a new van.  We couldn\u2019t find it so my salesperson said let me check on this.  A few minutes later he came back and said it was at a lot a few blocks away.  He asked me to wait amd said he would go get it. I agreed.  Thirty minutes later I was still waiting.  I called my salesperson to see what was going on and got no answer. I finally left to start the 2 hour drive back home.  I texted him and told him I was leaving.  He said he found the van and would send pictures.  Frustrated at this point, I thought I can see pictures online but whatever.  This was on a Monday.  Finally, on Saturday I agreed to the terms of purchase.  They asked when I could come down and sign the papers and I asked them to email them and I would sign them electronically.  The manager didn\u2019t know if they were setup to do that yet but would check and let me know.  (Another reviewer on here said they did their hole deal online!) I didn\u2019t hear back from him so I reached out on Monday and asked for a proposal with the final terms.  I got that email and did not hear back from them again. I reached out to them on Friday and was told they were trying to figure out how to get me the paper work.  I didn\u2019t hear back so Saturday evening I told the manager that I wasn\u2019t going to purchase the van.  So far, I haven\u2019t gotten a reply.  We had a deal, the financing was approved and yet it seems they were not interested in finishing the deal.  I have never experienced such at any other dealership.  I spent three years in automotive sales, when someone said we\u2019ve got a deal we were always quick to get them signed sealed and delivered.  I\u2019m still stunned by this outcome.

I\u2019m very confused as to why cause I was not given a proper reason! So all day today I\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with the general manager to ask why I have been fired, because Daniel was texting me asking me about the test, and how everything was going. Apparently Ford isn\u2019t the right fit for me and I\u2019m not a good candidate according to Lydia. I have 7 years of customer service and the job offers training so I\u2019m not sure how that made sense. In my attempt to contact the General sales manager aka Daniel Flatt he has ignored me and now blocked my number. So I\u2019m hoping this gets the dealerships attention. I was really counting on this job to help me pay my bills that are late (due to covid haven\u2019t been able to find work) not only would it have helped paid my bills.

Instead, he worked with us to find the right vehicle for us and went above and beyond to get us the best price possible (in reality,  not just in an advertisement).

It is with my F150 purchase were I am becoming more than frustrated and if not dealt with at this dealership will be moving any and all my business ASAP!  My F150 has 23K miles on it which are almost all highway miles.  Complained about the truck vibrating at speeds over 70 mph which has yet to be fixed or even addressed to my knowledge.  I also have a vibration when braking and was told my rotors need to be turned at a cost to me of about a 170 bucks.  Now I have owned many a car/truck and have never had to turn the rotors after only 23K miles of usage.  In fact, I don't think I have ever had to turn rotors on a car/truck I have purchased since I had a real job.  I am not sure if this dealership is willing to lose my business over 166 bucks, but I am damn sure willing to move it for that amount.

She was sure to search for a car that had a carfax and found several she liked online. We live over 100 miles from Adamson Ford and probably could have bought a car a lot closer...but because of the online reviews...she chose Adamson. Well this week, she had to have her entire brake system replaced at the local Ford dealership. They told her that the underside of her car was completely rusted out. This happens when cars are from Northern regions where they use salt on the roads to melt ice....or beach towns where there is natural salt in the air. in places like THAT....it is standard practice for a mechanic to check the underside of a car. My daughter's car was a late model 2014. The vehicle was most likely purchased at auction and came from another area in the US outside of Alabama. She was not expecting to have to pay for  new brakes and other rusted out parts on the bottom of her car. She called Adamson Ford about it and they said it was not their problem. Typical! They are nice and polite BEFORE you buy from them....but if you have a problem they change mighty quick. This was my daughter's very first vehicle. She tried to ask all the right questions and STILL got burned. No help from THIS dealership! And worse...no acknowledgement that they did not check the bottom of the car before selling it to an unsuspecting 21 yr. old kid. Yeah...I am one angry parent! Shame on Adamson Ford. We will NEVER use you again. You COULD have helped with the cost a little. But once you made the deal...you abandoned your customer!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}

My father managed the parts department there up until 2 years ago (because the new owners were crooks & he couldn\u2019t stand to work with them any longer). Since, my sister bought a car from Adamson & was very happy with her experience. So in December, I decided I\u2019d start getting my oil changes there. I work @ UAB so it was convenient around my work hrs. My 1st experience was great! The guy that took care of me made sure the guy that drives the shuttle got me to work by 7:30. I picked up my car & paid leaving as a happy customer. My 2nd experience wasn\u2019t so great.\nI decided I\u2019d get my tires rotated as well. A different man took my order & I went inside to sign up for the shuttle service. That same man comes in & openly complains about how several people are out with the flu & says \u201cthis is just going to be a great day\u201d in an annoyed, sarcastic tone. As I\u2019m signing up for the shuttle, the guy that drives said, \u201cshuttle rides don\u2019t start until 8\u201d. To that I responded, \u201cThe guy that was here last time made sure I was at UAB in time to clock in & you were the one that drove me\u201d. He said, \u201cthat should be fine as long as a lot of people don\u2019t sign up\u201d, & then after asking if I should walk 15 minutes later, he finally drove me (10 minutes after asking). Mind you, I didn\u2019t have that problem at all the 1st time. As I\u2019m working I get a call from them saying \u201cMa\u2019am when we were rotating your tires we noticed that they are in big need of changing. Can we put on new tires for you?\u201d He didn\u2019t expect me to not be na\u00efve & mindlessly say yes (being a single young female). I asked, \u201cHow much would that be\u201d & he said, \u201cOh uh\u2026$1,600\u201d. I said, \u201dAbsolutely not!\u201d & instead, took my car to a place in my hometown & got 4 top brand, brand new for $950.\nLast week I decided to give them another shot thinking if that guy was there that served me the 1st time, it should be okay. I saw him, but was served by a man I hadn\u2019t seen before. I ordered an oil change & tire rotation. I avoided the hassle of the shuttle & made the 15 min walk to work. I got a call from a female saying \u201cwhen we were rotating your tires we noticed a nail in one of them & if we took it out the hole would be too big to patch, can we replace that tire?\u201d I, of course, said no & to that she said, \u201cokay well we can\u2019t rotate your tires then\u201d. I told her that was fine. But I thought the whole thing was strange because I hadn\u2019t once received a \u201clow tire pressure\u201d warning. When I went to pick up my car I noticed on their write up they documented the nail. So I took my car to my parents so dad & his friend could look. NO NAIL! I tried calling the following day to speak with the manager, & the lady that I spoke with was rude, & on top of that, REFUSED to give me her name. Apparently, they don\u2019t have a general manager, they just have a manager per department. I wanted to be fair thinking maybe the head guy didn\u2019t know about his workers, but if it\u2019s the manager of the parts department, they know, which is why I\u2019m turning here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to try to screw people over to get more money, my grandfather didn\u2019t run his business that way. & the best thing I can do is caution other people from going. At least to the parts department.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}

After getting the vehicle home and detailing the car thoroughly, we noticed that the passenger door sounded hollow (like an empty garbage can).  We immediately took the vehicle to Myer's Auto Collision to have the car inspected --after inspecting it, he found the vehicle to have had over $4000 worth of damage (passenger back door had so much bondo it couldn't be read on his meter, passenger door was a hollow shell (aftermarket part - not factory), the hood had also been replaced with aftermarket part - not factory and wetsanded and painted with trash in paint.  We also ran a Carfax and found out that the vehicle had been wrecked and the airbag was deployed and vehicle was undriveable and had to be towed.  We went to Adamson and talked to the manager, Mike Gargone on 2 different occasions about this and was told he would not cancel the contract and also told us that the vehicle had not been wrecked.  He also said that the vehicle had been bought at Manheim Auction in Georgia and that they do not have to divulge the information of any wreck to a vehicle and that he did not know the vehicle had been wrecked (we have had reliable sources to tell us this is not true -- that if a vehicle is wrecked and airbags are deployed, it has to be divulged to the buyer).  It is hard to believe that a supposedly reputable dealership that is well known in the city of Birmingham would conduct business the way they have.  We feel we have been violated by fraud, lied to, and deceived.  How would they as experts in cars not know this vehicle had been wrecked and how are they not liable for not divulging that information to  us as a consumer?

I have bought 2 vehicles from them. David G. The sales guy, Hes great, but the problem came when I bought an 06 f-150 from them in November of 2015. I purchased an extended warranty through them and less than a week later I cancelled it (after I read the fine print). So I am entitled to a full refund. So the dealership sends off the forms to cancel the warranty while I do the same through email. I have to talk to David A in financing and he is the problem. He told me for a month that he hadn't heard from the warrenty company and I told him that I had and that they told me that they cancelled the warrenty. So he tells me to send the email stating that to him and so I do. Well then he says that I have to sign the form and him send it in and I reminded him I had the form so I sent him the original form I sent to Alpha warrenty. I finally tagged him in an email with Alpha Warrenty to get it all straighted out. Then Alpha calls me and asks who to send the email to, I Tell them David in financing and so they DO!!!! I call Adamsonford again and guess what? David in financing tells me that he got the email and is sending the check. Thats was December 14, 2015. So I call my finance company on Jan. 4, 2016 and they haven't received a payment. I email David in financing again and he says he's waiting on alpha from a fax he sent on December 14, 2015. I call the dealership and now someone else is \"helping\" who I won't disclose at this time. And he is waiting on a response from alpha warrenty. ...... really??? I've BOUGHT 2 VEHICLES FROM THIS PLACE AND WAS GOING TO AGAIN..... all I can say is things better go right or I will discourage everyone on every page and website, social media and whatever else I can. If a customer calls with a problem you don't just email or call the place then leave it, you keep calling or emailing until it's fixed especially when I buy more than once......\nAfter submitting this review I had a lady contact me named Melissa. She looked into the problem and found that they never sent the money for the warrenty. She has been a pleasure to work with and I wish I would have done this sooner. Sadly I won't be buying another vehicle from them as long as David A. In financing or Shaun(syan) works there as their apathy and laziness is appalling. Everthing is sunshine and rainbows until u have a problem.Everyone else at adamsonford is great, but if the finance guy who pushes a warrenty doesn't send the money, what else are they not doing?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}

On March 25, 2016 I was at malfunction junction when my 2007 Mustang just stopped working. I pull over & immediately use my road side assistance then google the nearest Ford dealership because I was fairly new to the area. I called the service department & not sure who I spoke with but he was friendly & I told him I would be having my car towed to them for diagnostic work within the hour. He said ok bring it in. Ok me & my boyfriend  follow the tow truck there & speak with Jay in service. He assured me that would try to figure it out. After sitting there for 30min, he comes to the break room & said it was my battery. I said ok replace it. Did that & it still would not crank up. So him & another gentleman almost tore up the starter by trying to crank it & I literally had to say PLEASE stop doing that. So it was around 3 on a friday so Jay stated that the head tech was out & leave my car for the weekend & Monday he will call me by 10am & let me know whats the problem. I said ok. Well Monday I called in to work so I could be available about my car. I called him at 1030 am because I hadnt heard from him. He said they still working on it & try back at 12. Called at 1230pm & he replied they cant get my car crunk up so they dont know whats wrong. That they will start from the bottom up to find the problem.I said I need to know the problem because thats my way to work. He said as long as it doesnt crank up they cant find out. My dad is a retired mechanic so I ask why is that because most car issues often doesnt allow the car to crank up. He said they know its misfiring but dont know from where. I said the diagnostic machine should tell you. I was informed then they dont have a diagnostic machine to put my car own. I about passed out. I said well how long will this take because I need a car to get to work & I need to know what to do. Jay told me that I may need to call enterprise because they dont give out loaner cars & cant fix it until they figure out whats wrong. I said my dad & brother fix on cars & I have never heard of a Ford dealership not able to tell me what was wrong with a Ford car. Jay reply was why dont you get them to look at it. I was just angry. So I called my dad & brother out of town & they instructed me to get to a local Pep boys to get diagnostic testing. Informed Jay of this on that Monday that a tow truck would be to get my car that Tuesday morning. Jay informed my road side assistance that I owed them no money but I didnt want to use them because I didnt want to pay them. By now I was livid. My boyfriend was too. So the following day the tow truck driver went there 2 times to get my car for them to not be able to get my car because it wasnt accesible. I called them & informed them if they dont have my car accesible a 3rd time I was coming with the police. 3rd time tow truck was able to get my car.  Took it to Pep boys & they had a diagnosis within 2hrs. Well in May I left the same review on their facebook page & whoever is over it apologized & offered me 2 free oil changes. Well I have tried to get these 2 free oil changes for me to get there at 2pm on June 28th for Jay to yell out they done with oil changes for the day. So the gentleman at the desk asked could I come back the next day. I said I work all day. He said can you drop it off at lunch. I said sure. I called the next day at lunch to say can you bring it at 2pm. I said no. Tried to bring it again then no time. Its sad that you offer me something for bad service to get bad service on the free offer as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}

My SUV was more difficult. I asked for good quality glass and I'm not exactly sure what I got.\nI wanted the glass installed following the instructions spelled out in the factory Service Manual. When I would explain to the installers how it NEEDED to be done they pushed back by saying that was not necessary. My SUV has a specific way to install the windshield that is out of the ordinary. If steps aren't followed then its going to leak. They assured me that it wouldn't leak the way they did it and I really did not want to put that to the test with their way of doing it. I supplied my own new factory gasket for the job. If I had not had that they would have reused the 20 year old gasket that was glued to the old windshield. The manual says to use a NEW gasket.\n\nAll the glass installers I have delt with to get this done have just about all been the same. They are payed by they job and want to get done and on to the next job. I care about my car and if I'm gong to pay to have this done I want it done right. As the customer they need to consider that I probably have a good idea what I'm talking about and should listen and absorb what I'm telling them because I didn't want it to leak and I know they didn't want to have to come back and fix it.\n\nMy experience with the installers that came today was the reason for the bad rating. I don't appreciate their attitude towards my instructions I had for them.  I walked inside to get cash to pay them while they were working and quietly came back outside to hear them talking about me and how I was trying to micromanage them.  One of the guys actually told me he could see why they other companies didn't want to do the job. Which was a rude thing to say. He couldn't handle I wanted things done a certain way (the correct way).\n\nI'm sure most windshields are simple and easy to replace.
