I was informed by an employee that they do not take reservations for the room on Saturday, only during the week. However, I was intrigued by the pictures online and wanted to see the room in person as well as to see if something could be worked out. Upon arriving, I was told again by the same girl I had spoken to previously that the room could not be reserved on Saturday. Although, she mentioned that if my party and I arrived at opening time we could possibly get the room. On 5/12, I arrived at 8:00 with decorations in tow but only to be informed by the owner that not only was the meeting room RESERVED but also there were THREE RESERVATIONS on the books for that day, one of which was paid! When I explained to the owner about how his staff had lied to me and how I was never given the option of a paid reservation he was less than bothered and unsympathetic. He only offered to seat us anyway as if he was doing us a favor. The manager eventually came out because my guests were upset and wanted an explanation as well. We never got one and neither the owner or the manager ever apologized to us or reprimanded the server I dealt with who just so happened to be working that day. As a result, my guests and I ended up leaving. I host different events throughout the year but I will never again consider Brick & Spoon for an event.

MOBILE BEST BREAKFASTS PLACE IS HERE!\n\nOkay so initially when I heard there was a place called Brick & spoon I'm thinking that this place is going to have brick walls and a spoon on every table. To my surprise this is one of the most modern restaurants in Mobile this place looks beautiful I actually came there underdressed thinking I was going to some mom-and-pop restaurant with the capability of cooking good food. Speaking of food the shrimp and grits is actually better than the shrimp and grits on kitchen and George Street I couldn't believe it I actually think one of the best restaurants in Mobile actually has a contender. You guys really need to keep up the good work. The prices are a little high but the food is worth it without a doubt I would rather than have the prices high and good food then lower the prices and it change the quality. I could not afford to eat breakfast there every day but I could afford to eat breakfast at three to four times a week and it is so worth it I am really thinking about budgeting in eating breakfast there in my monthly budget. They also use waitr. Mobile get in where you fit in don't let this one slip out of your hands. Get your brick and your spoon and enjoy hitting them together while you eat. I really don't think you're supposed to do that there but I hope it starts a trend!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1527697030083, "text": "We love your review!

Brick & Spoon claimed to serve \u2018no boring breakfasts.\u2019\nWow! I can\u2019t remember ever enjoying breakfast this much. But let me start at beginning. The staff was pleasant and professional: hostess, waitress, table, buster\u2014all the best. Next, coffee: fresh, aromatic and tasty. They have a long menu of coffee drinks that should make Starbucks cry. OJ, excellent. If you are a Bloody Mary fan, you will be in paradise with the ability to customize your favorite with a parade of optional ingredients. Pineapple Mimosa whispered in my ear, and it was a welcome opener for my day.\nWe started with bruschetta. It was a taste of perfect balance of crunchy, tart, sweet\u2014indescribably delicious.\nMy husband wants \u2018regular breakfast.\u2019 The American of 2 eggs and sides was cooked perfectly: fluffy scrambled eggs, sour dough toast, heavenly bacon (crisp, the perfect thick-ish, non greasy, with marvelous taste) \u2014 and, absolutely the best grits I have put in my mouth in my 67 years \u2014 and that is a LOT of grits from a lot of different cooks. If you are new to grits or just think you don\u2019t like grits, don\u2019t miss your chance to taste them here \u2014 but do order them \u2018plain\u2019 so that you can experience want diners deserve in grits. Many cooks have grits on their menu but sadly, do them poorly. Save the cheese and other options for after you know what grits SHOULD taste like!\nGrowing up near New Orleans, we could not resist beignets; again well done and worthy as a delightful finish to a memorable meal.\nGive Brick and Spoon an opportunity to make some delicious memories for you!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d74bdfd35eb:0x34879120f2c1b42"}

Occupancy on departure 5 tables.  The good news:  if your looking for a clean restaurant this is it.  Also, the grits are great.  On the other hand, read on.  I had the American Bkfst and my wife ordered the Shrimp Creole Omelette.  When Morgan delivered food we noticed that the Omelette did not have the specified Hollandaise Sauce.  No problem, Megan took it to the kitchen and returned it with Sauce.  Finally we began eating our together as I had already started and as others reported my American Bkfst could have been delivered at a better temperature.  After starting on the omelette my wife said she had no shrimp, upon futher inspection we discovered it to be a ham and cheese omelette and told Megan...oooops I must have picked up the wrong one...no kidding.  Upon which she left and immediately delivered the Shrimp Creole Omelette, now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that that dish Sat up there when my dish was prepared.  My wife said that she would keep the ham and cheese omelette since she had started on it.  How can you not get this right the dishes don't look alike.  We didn't know the difference until she delivered the correct dish...ooops.  i.e.cold food poor service..additionally how can a bkfts restaurant IN THE SOUTH have one choice for hot sauce and for bread you get either a biscuit, white toast or English muffen...not in my world, so never again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d74bdfd35eb:0x34879120f2c1b42"}
