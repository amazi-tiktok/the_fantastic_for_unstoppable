He's also constantly working to improve his business and make sure everyone that walks in the door has a great time. He also runs a pretty dope YouTube channel called Nerd Torch TV.\n\nThe store is organized and managed extremely well. There are several rooms dedicated to different types of gaming. There is a room for tabletop games, another for rhythm games like Guitar Hero or DDR, and other rooms dedicated to console games. There's even a PC built for gaming. Multiplayer games are very popular and this is a great place to find people that love to play Smash. I don't think I've ever been to the cafe when there wasn't someone playing Smash or Mario Cart. There's a great community built up around the cafe as well. All of the cafe members are invited to a GroupMe chat where you can get updates on events or just chat and hang out.
