Everyone in the office is just super kind. Trust the process and trust in your ability to heal and the work he does on you whether it be chiropractic, acupuncture, ERT (energy clearing) or otherwise will be truly life changing. At first the ERT may seem silly, but let me tell you!.. I've done energy work before as its practiced often in my field of work, and he really has a wonderful knack for it and has helped me work out years and lifetimes of negative emotion that was holding me back! I highly recommend this place just the same as I would recommend a spa or retreat. I even got my husband to go now!

Before I had done the in take paper work as a new patient we were talking about  12 visit plan. I didn\u2019t feel that I was heard. There seemed to be an agenda other than my condition. I will say that they had me in and out fast.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624416536659, "text": "Thank you for your review. Your input is appreciated.\nYour perspective on the first visit is different than most of our patients but significant. The intake paperwork asks the patient to list all their symptoms and quantify their health complaints and instructs the patients to quantify their level of improvement over the next 12 treatments.... That is correct. The reason the paperwork addresses a treatment plan is so patients are aware from the beginning that holistic treatment is not a one treatment panacea, it's not a pill and it's not magic. It is a healing process and the specifics are handled individually with each patient.\nA 20 minutes face to face with a physician is unheard of these days and if you feel that was a short visit so be it. In a 20-minute visit we addressed the entire human frame above and beyond the chief complaint plus acupuncture and tongue analysis. The process didn't stop when you left the office but it continued as the tongue analysis was performed by OUM physicians in California and THERE WERE THREE EMAIL CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFICS. That was a step I take out of true concern for the health and well-being of my patients but it's cases like these that make excellent physicians become callus.\nBest of luck on your journey and next time find something to praise about the next person that gives a damn about your health and well-being"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892927a6c918d1b:0x6fa1927cce21bd5d"}
