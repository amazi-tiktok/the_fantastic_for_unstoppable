And honestly it was the best thing for me to do and should have done sooner. I really did enjoy him going to Kiddie Care in the beginning. A couple of months into him going was when the problems started. Teachers were not consistent in the class rooms. It seemed like there was a new teacher in the class room every few weeks. The classrooms are over-crowded with kids. I had problems with a couple of his teachers. One of them told him that he could lay in his urine after he told her that he had wet himself at nap time. I told the co-director and she did write the teacher up and moved my child to a different class. And recently I learned that at times when kids are eating, if they talk, their food gets taken away. There is also a write up system which I think is ridiculous. Most of the write ups were things normal 3 year old boys do. Even his teacher said he\u2019s just being a boy on most of them, yet they write them up anyways. His most recent teacher always seemed to have a bad attitude in the mornings and wasn\u2019t a cheery person whatsoever. The co-director tried helping me with some issues I was having but in the end it just wasn\u2019t enough. My child was not happy going to daycare anymore. He started his new daycare on Monday and I can already tell a difference in him. He\u2019s so much happier when he gets home. I\u2019m giving it 2 stars because the co-director was nice and there were a couple of teachers I did appreciate.

Everyone else is training for the fast food economy or dropping out. My family went from honor roll in Germany to dropouts in Saks due to the distracting nature (a lot of focus on things that don't matter like racial profiling, football, and sneaking in school prayer, while letting things like crime, bullying, and sexual activity and the needs of the many underprivileged kids fly under the radar), and poor quality of the school (look up the poor math and reading scores as evidence). I left this school for one in Georgia and there was an instant turnaround! Just by getting out of that environment, I quickly graduated with honors. I can go into much more detail, but I'll leave it here. This review is based on my own recollection of experiences during 1998-2001 and is honest to the best of my ability.

I was small and not that tough when I got there but absolutely nothing happened to me like that. I learned so much about life and how to be a person that people would look up to and how to be a leader and live life responsibly. I was there with Col. Bill Jenertte who, even after I Graduated stayed in contact and anytime I was in a fork in the road after I graduated I could call him and if he didn\u2019t answer he would call me back or if he was busy another staff member would call me back and they all remember their students. They saved my life. I graduated as the Battalion Commander and I started there like everyone else, a scrub. I went through leadership trading and left at the top of the ranks. I loved that place so much some weekends when we had the opportunity to go home for open weekend I would choose to stay on campus. And I\u2019m from Destin Florida where it\u2019s warm and I could go on my dads boat and jet skis and have a great weekend but LWMA became a family to me too that some weekends I would want to stay there. If I could say one thing with 100% certainty is that if I never attended LWMA I honestly know I wouldn\u2019t of been able to have the life I have now and I sure wouldn\u2019t know how to live life with character. I live by a cadet code. That is\nTo be faithful, honest, and sincere in every act and purpose and to know honorable failure is better than success by unfairness or cheating.\n\nThat cadet code has made it possible to now own a house and own two charter boats and I also have a 500 Ton captains license. I have a baby on the way and I was just telling my wife that I would love to drive up there this year to visit the campus.\n\nLong story short: Every teenager should go because it would save their lives and the education they would get with the sports and the more one on one with teachers can not compare to any other school in America. I am forever greatful to LWMA.

Some reviews were bad and a few were good.  Well, I have decided to share my experience as a parent.  I have been very impressed with the people who help run this school.  I have visited the school and engaged cadets there in open and honest discussion.  I agree, the school can be very difficult for students who are very determined NOT to make an inner change and correct incorrect behavior.  There is a chance that your child may not change, but I feel it is very slim.  Many of the students will tell you that it is not helping them and they have not changed but that is just so that you will bring them back home.  If you stick with it, you will notice a change in behavior regardless of what they will try to tell you.  The school has been very open and honest with me.  Even when the biggest misfortunate event took place this past semester, they kept every parent informed continuously and immediately.  The price is somewhat high, but if you can somehow afford it, even one semester is worth it.  I wish the school was somehow more affordable because there are many young men out here whose lives would be saved and changed for the better.  If you have a troubled teen, you can either do nothing (which can eventually lead to jail or the grave) or you can make an attempt to correct their path and possibly save them.  Sending your kid here does not promise to save your child, but if the worst is eventually going to happen(fate), you would rather look back later and know you did eveything you could have done.  Even though it was a difficult decision to make, I am glad that I sent my son here.  I will more than likely enroll him back into the public school system next semester.  He may not be perfect, but I feel confident that after going to this school this semester, he will not get anywhere close back to the person he was.  If he does, I know the doors of Lyman Ward are still open and the people there will be willing to help.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c633de0bee293:0xb7186d4ccab73737"}

Most of the good ones come from parents who have seen their sons change and learn discipline and respect and attitude and improvements in their grades. Most of the negative ones have come from the cadets themselves though some of these are also positive. I am an alumus of Lyman Ward. To be truthful, I didn't like it when I was there. I hated being uprooted from friends and family and stuck in an all-boys school 100 miles from home. In my case I was sent there because my dad had always wanted to go to a military school when he was growing up so he gave me the opportunity that he never had. (Thanks Dad.) I don't know to this day whether Lyman Ward helped me or not. I was not a bad kid, I didn't get in trouble and I made decent grades. But I know that it helped the vast majority of boys that I went to school with, most of whom had a choice of military school, reform school or juvenile hall.\n\nWhat I know about Lyman Ward is that it's hard. It's hard being taken from everything you know and placed among strangers. I also know this. There are many young men who would not be where they are today if it were not for their parent's courage to send them to Lyman Ward. I also know young men who would not be alive today if not for the discipline of Lyman Ward.\n\nLWMA is an extremely hard experience but most students come out of that school with a love that is hard to explain except for the pride of what they endured and accomplished and the men that they have become.\n\nIf you have a son who is struggling with his life, Lyman Ward may be the answer that you are looking for. I disagree with those who would put their son here for a semester or a year unless they only have one year left.

But with the EXCELLENT work of Dr. Brenda Coley and the newly appointed Principle Ms. Johnston, I have completely changed my view and attitude of this school.  The days of rudeness, not caring, and students doing what they want when they want are gone!!! Ms. Johnston holds her staff and the students to ALL Russell County School District rules and regulations.  If even on student from RCSM is at a sporting activity, extra curricular activity and student support program she is there.  Her leading by example as the teachers and faculty doing the same.  The student body and facility work as a team. I have witnessed first hand the excitement and pride this family of adults and children show for their school, teams and themselves.  Don't believe me.......attend a pep rally, awards recognition program or just come by (unannounced) and stand in the corner and watch.  I promise you will be amazed.  Dr. Coley is known for putting the right people, in the right job and she made a bulls eye with Ms. Johnston.  I'm not saying everything is perfect.  The school didn't get broke over night and Dr. Coley and Ms. Johnston are not going to be able to fix it over night, but if you had told me in May I would be this happy with this program, I would have laughed in your face.  My child and her friends LOVE their teachers, the staff and each other.  Ms. Johnston practices that respect is given to EVERYONE regardless of age, gender or race.  She gives it and she expects it to be given from her staff, faculty and student body.  The teachers want these students to do well.  It's no long \"collecting\" a pay check for them.  Those attitudes and personnel are gone.  Before you judge/write/say anything negative about this school based on actions, information, attitudes prior to Dr. Coley and Ms. Johnston taking charge, come by the school, talk to the staff, students,  volunteer, attended an after school activity, you too will love this place.  But, I must say that it is not all Russell County Middle School or the Superintendents job to make this better.  As a VERY active parent, I have learned that unless you get involved in your child's academic life, friends, and activities that the school and district can only go so far.  The policy now is the front and back door are always open.  Come and see for yourself.  Make an appointment, can't come in person......call your child's teacher.  I promise you....you'll LOVE the results.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd90cd579075b:0x4ec64e86c20f7ab1"}

The staff takes great covid precautions with pickup, dropoffs and the rooms, and they always make it a really fun experience for him and for me every day. I think any time you take your kid to day care you need to expect that they are going to be exposed to more germs and be sick a little more, but that's going to happen whether it be day care, preschool, kindergarten, church or sports. It's unavoidable if you want your child to interact with the world outside of your home.

Both times the experience was HORRIBLE (not sure why we even decided to give them a second chance after the first time's issues). As an infant, he was sick every alternate week while at Milestones.  One week he would go to Milestones and catch something, then we would keep him home for a week and fix him up.  The next week he would catch something else again.  It was a perpetual cycle because of which we decided to pull him out.\n\nHe then restarted daycare (somewhere else) when he was a year old.  For 6 months he was relatively healthy - barring the occasional cough / cold.  We started him back at Milestones this week (i.e. 18  months).  He has been there all of 3 days and already he has caught a stomach bug. This place is horrible!  On day 1 when we went to pick him up, his milk cup was not washed and just sitting around.  The second day, his pacifier was missing.  When I asked the teacher where his pacifier was, she started looking among the toys.  That should have been my first clue - if the teacher is looking for a pacifier amongst the toys, god alone knows how many kids have put it in their mouth!  And the pacifier had a string attached to it, so they could just have clipped it to our son, but they did not care to do that.  The \"teachers\" as such are a bunch of college kids, and most of them have no clue what they are doing.

I'm in NASA's Best which is a class for advanced learners. I'm proud to be a part of it. There aren't as many fights as there used to be. The students are defiant, and misbehave constantly, but that isn't the teacher's fault. There is one security guard and one police officer. Talking in the hallway is not allowed, yet people still do it. That's why they get extra homework and detention. Maybe if people acted right they wouldn't be getting in trouble.\n\nEDIT: Lmao I hate this school. NASA's Best was great but now we just do computer work. There still aren't too many fights, which is boring. Kids are still defiant, and I understand why. I don't know what was wrong with me last year. Mrs. Farmer is ok, but if she expects us to come to her when we have an issue that's really funny. Some of these teachers get into personal business that isn't their own, some don't put in grades, and some just flat out bore me. Mrs. Henderson (the art teacher) and Mr. King (the choir teacher) are pretty much the best things about this school. Lunch ladies don't let me get seconds, but at the end of the day they still throw out food, which is wasteful. The food itself is a little better, which is funny because it only got better my last year. Everyday I walk these halls and I die a little inside. This school hasn't prepared me for anything but failure. Can't wait for the day I get to walk out of here for the last time and never come back.
