My daughter attended preschool there from age 2 through K4. Tuition can be pricey & there can be a waiting list from time to time, but my husband & I believe it was worth it. The administration & staff are both knowledgeable & experienced. Admission to the preschool/daycare/after school care is limited. You either have to be buzzed in by staff or you have to have a security code to unlock the door. Children must be both signed in & out. Children are supervised at all times. Meals are nutritious & made on site by some truly wonderful ladies. Children are educated, cared for & loved by administrator & staff. We feel that our daughter's 3 years at FBCHPS has benefitted her educationally, socially & morally. She is 8 years old now & has been away from the preschool since she was 5 & what memories she has of her time there are precious to her. She misses it\u2764\ufe0f\n\nAlthough neither my husband nor I are members of FBCH, we have attended services there several times. We found the congregation & minister to be welcoming & warm. Congregants are kind & generous. There is ample parking for both the disabled & non. The church is wheelchair accessible & congregants are cheerful & helpful. This is a Community Oriented church. By that, I mean that the church & congregation are highly supportive of the Headland community & the schools of the City of Headland. I found the congregation & the staff of the preschool to be open, helpful & compassionate to the needs of members of the community once they were advised of needs.

The worst place in Oxford is on the south side of Hwy 78 East. The BEST place is A&B and they are located on the north side of 78 just east of Hutch Touch. I'm in retail sales in the trailer industry myself and A & B Trailers is my go to source for information, parts, and trailers. If  I have a question about ANYTHING in regards to dragging a wagon... A&B Trailers.. Knowledge level? I'll put it this way; theres not anything they can't  cover on your trailer.  I promise, they will never lead you wrong. These guys are not pencil pushers that have sit behind a desk all of their lives. They are blue collar, hard working, hands on, highly experienced fabricators and they know their stuff. If you want to spend half of your retirement on junk just to have it fall apart in a few months, then go across the street and shop with Ward. Now if you want an extremely well built, solid piece of equipment at a reasonable price  from an excellent company that stands behind their product AND appreciates their customers?... Welcome home family!! You are in the right place. A&B Trailers. You won't find better people anywhere and let me just add this in there.... these cats are Perfectionists. I know. I have worked side by side with them in a fab shop and I am a perfectionist also, but these jokers....well they take it to a whole nother other level. I will take an oath to say, \"They do things at A&B with a whole bunch of heart and a truck load of pride. It's done once, done right, and that's the product they will provide you every single time. I highly recommend A&B Trailers for all of your parts, accessories,  tires, wheels, batteries, or even if you are looking to upgrade with a brand new piece of pride attached to your vehicle.. Come on down to A&B. I'm sure glad I stopped here. Received a solid product and made two friends for life. Where else can you get service like that? A&B Trailers. Ask for Andy or Barney. NO need in referencing my review. They'll know who sent ya when you call them by their names \ud83e\udd23", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb1986beb8101:0x586c73bb92afd432"}
