Thanks Jamie!\n\nThe reason that I am giving Uni1st an overall 3  stars is because we often have problems withour towels being full of lint. They also come torn or very worn also. We sometimes do not get a full bag, shorting us before our next delivery.  Our aprons that we receive often have half of the tie torn off. So we can't even tie them on. Also, they come very stained occasionally as if they have been mildewed and then laundered. The mildew stain is still there after the wash. We pay a fee each week for these items to be replaced as needed, but we rarely see new items in the\nmix. We have also had problems with the posting of payments in a timely manner. Because the payments are not posted we then get a late charge added to the bill.

Yet republic has billed me for 3 months of service that I have not used them. I changed service because the new representative system uses a call center based format from a local office. The call center never resolves my problem. To clarify once my rep went from Robin to Charles Davis I got very poor service. At that time I decided to cancel service and go with a local company. Once I canceled service my rep has not fixed my billing errors. Corporate says they have emailed Charles to fix the errors but has not fixed them. At this point the time is greater than 2 work days trying to resolve this problem. My advice would be to switch to another local company that has better billing practices and prices as I have.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604954538597, "text": "Hi James, please accept our apologies for your frustrations and I am disappointed we have lost your business.

I have always been treated very well from them so, NO I did not want to change. After a while of thinking about it SEVERAL MONTHS and my Son hammering me with the RJ YOUNG name, I did it. I purchased a machine from RJ YOUNG.\nAt first I was skeptical and to be honest I really didn't want to give it a chance (The Machine), but I did and after several months and barely using the machine I starting coming more around it and using it a little more & more. Then I began to really like it because it really printed so nice and pretty fast. It only took me  8 to 10 months to like it but you have to understand I WAS A XEROX Man and I thought there was NOTHING out there but Xerox. The Xerox machine has ALWAYS  performed outstanding and the SERVICE was the best, I was spoiled from that. However, I found out that there was more out there than XEROX! I found out that RJ YOUNG was REAL and believe me they have made a believer out of me. The Service that I thought would not compare to XEROX, has showed me they are just as good and if not BETTER. I never thought I would say that but it is so true. I can not believe how fast the Service Technicians reply to the service calls. They are always polite, and get me back up and running in a very quickly manner. They have such good personalities and a smile! As for the Ladies at the Home Office, Oh My How can you NOT like them. They are AMAZING. They always tell me they will have my supplies on the way or a Technician asap. IT IS JUST SO HARD TO PUT IN WORDS what RJ Young has done for my business. This is a very caring company and to be honest I am so glad that I have some of their product and that I was introduced to the World outside of XEROX. RICO machines have made my life SO MUCH Better and I am so happy that I have changed.
