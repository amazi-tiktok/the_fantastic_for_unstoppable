I have been doing retail business with Washer and Refrigeration Supply for at least 40 years. Firstly, Washer and Refrigeration Supply is basically a wholesale only company.  They do not have any patience with DYI customers.  Since they are about the only game in town, they can treat folks about anyway they care to.  They treat their trade customers entirely differently.  I don't know why they even bother with the retail side of the business; I can only guess since they charge the absolute maximum for retail parts, profit must be the reason.  Here is the best way to approach this vendor (provide you need the part immediately and cannot get it on line) - 1.)Make sure you can handle the repair you are trying to accomplish.  2.)Always, repeat, always, take your old part with you and have them check it with the new part, let them open the package.  If they become surly or refuse to compare parts, just leave with your old part and go on line or call an appliance service and buy the part from them.  A lot of services (not all) will do this.  It will cost you more, but the part will be correct and you will not have to deal with the ugly side of WRS. 3.)Always pay with a credit card so if you truly feel (after following the advice hereon) that they have screwed you, file a complaint with the credit card company.  Lastly, buy on line when possible; this company is a survivor because they are ruthless and they are not going to change.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d4e282eb02b:0xc0f254926f26d6d9"}

The only call you'll need for all your HVAC needs!\n\nI called these guys up a few weeks ago late in the afternoon because my Air Conditioner wasn't cooling very efficiently and sometimes not at all.  I figured the worst because my A/C unit was about 20 years old and that I was going to have to drop $8,000 into a new unit.  I called them up and they said they'd have a guy out there first thing the next morning!\n\nTheir technician showed up before 9:00AM and began diagnosing my HVAC system.  In a couple hours he had gone through the cooling system from top to bottom and performed their Preventative Maintenance service on my A/C unit and it was cooling as if it were brand new.  The tech was very polite and thorough in diagnosing the issue and did an excellent job answering all my questions.  We talked a little bit about the cost of replacing the unit and what he would recommend but in no way was trying to push a sale on me.\n\nThe price for the service he performed was well below what I was expecting to pay.  These guys have certainly outdone themselves in this industry and they will be my sole source for all my HVAC needs.

The owner, Shane, is very personable and the kind of guy you can trust with your door unlocked. Opie (dead ringer for a younger Ron Howard), his technician, is a relatively young guy (23), but mature beyond his years and a very good HVAC tech. He's also trustworthy and the kind of guy you would want to represent your company. Most importantly, he was able to diagnose my heat pump problem quickly and efficiently...10 to 15 minutes. The HVAC was over amped.\n\nThe company that installed my TRANE XL14 heat pump in 2007, Alabama Climate Control (ACC) of Huntsville, apparently did not notice that the heat pump was rated for max amperage of 40 amps because they did not bother to change the 50 amp circuit breaker in the panel in the garage. One would expect a professional HVAC company to do a basic electrical circuit check/test to ensure the electrical circuit is compatible with your NEW heat pump...right!?!?\n\nAnyway, this oversight by ACC resulted in a fried circuit breaker in the junction box at the heat pump. Opie said we were lucky this situation did not result in a burned up motor or worse a burned down house. After all that, Opie tried to give me a $25 discount because I'm a veteran.\n\nThank you for the sentiment Opie, but also thank you for identifying a problem that has caused me great anguish over the years. I had to replace 3 or 4 compressors on the original heat pump (a Rheem) about 15 years ago when we first started renting out the house.\n\nThe HVAC company (same ACC) kept replacing all those compressors under warranty at $250 to $300 a pop for labor, but just couldn't figure out what was causing all those compressors to burn up (the same 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker box). Then, I was dumb enough to hire them again to install a new TRANE in 2007. Remeber, the TRANE is rated for a maximum of 40 amps, but ACC left the same old 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker panel. Voila...we get a fried junction box this time.\n\nIncredible...that it took a young 23 year old tech with a lot less experience (but more common sense and intelligence) to recognize that a 50 amp circuit breaker is going to eventually cause some problems if it is not compatible with the rest of the circuit.\n\nThe cautionary tale here is...be extremely vigilant and careful about who you let work on your electrical systems and watch them like a hawk when they do...until you find a company like SMS that has techs like Opie.. Thank you SMS and Opie for saving my house from a potential fire.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462206716420, "text": "Thanks Dwight! We are very happy we could take care of your heat pump needs!
