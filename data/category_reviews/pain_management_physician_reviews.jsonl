They didn't. So I call to make sure I had one. The old lady that answered the phone was rude to hell and back. I never wanted to cuss someone out so bad. I explained that the website said one thing and she's saying another. No need to be so freaking rude. I understand you have been sitting at that desk since moses but if you don't like your job retire. Also fix the website and be specific. You can not tell me that what I seen doesn't exist. Telling me know doesn't change the fact that it is there. Not to mention when you call it clearly says you can book appointments 24/7.

I needed an epidural for my lumbar spine (I hate taking pain meds). I had seen several doctors including an ER Dr. who all said the same thing\u2014get an epidural. So on the day of my appointment my wife drives me to the VA hospital and I decide to walk to the clinic (walking is good for your back). This clinic is located in one of Birmingham\u2019s housing projects filled with abandoned homes, halfway houses, thugs, and free range pit bulls. I show up to my 1PM appointment at 1130 knowing I will have paperwork to do. I wait until 1:30 before I am called back for a urinalysis and then promptly sent back out to the waiting room to continue waiting. This the closest I have ever felt to being a prison inmate. Apparently pain clinics are only for people who abuse medications\u2014at least, that\u2019s how you are treated. The new patient packet was thick and asked a lot of questions, when the \u201cnurse\u201d? Finally called me back she took my height and weight then asked me all the questions again (what a waste of time). Finally the Dr. comes in for 5 minutes give or take, tells me I have a screwed up back and that I should get an epidural..... then I\u2019m taken out to get everything scheduled for 3 epidurals over three months and an 8 week follow up. The first thing they could get me was 2 weeks later on the 24th. For the second epidural I tell the young lady that I would like to do the follow up on the same day, I have a 2 hour drive (one way) to get there and take off work. Now, I\u2019m no rocket scientist but 2 months is 8 weeks. I am told for insurance purposes they can\u2019t do both on the same day.(aka they can\u2019t bill me twice if I do it on the same day). Then I overhear the receptionists telling each other that they can\u2019t tell people that the billing company is in Texas..... They now have to say it\u2019s an outside company. All said and done this was hands-down the worst experience I have had (and I fought in two wars). I was made to feel like a criminal, had to wait a long time, ended up in a super bad area of town, was blatantly told they are gonna charge my insurance as much as possible even if it inconveniences me. They pushed full anesthesia instead of a local anesthetic which is the normal (assuming to squeeze my insurance for more money), and then instructing other employees to lie to customers.

I thought when I met Dr. Goyne I thought I had found the doctor I had always looking for, boy was I wrong. On my second visit  she cut my pain medicine in half and then I get a call that she is not going to give me medicine anymore without a reason .I feel I deserve a reason. Morgan always calls and so rude, she dont want to give me my pain pills but schedule a block for this week. I dont understand after being on this medication for 7 years from a bad car accident how she can just decide I dont need my medicine anymore but I need a pain block. Back to the charges they charge 200 per drug screen and $70 dollars everytime you fill out that tablet. I have decided to go to a suboxin  clinic and try to get off this medicine, I am tired of these doctor's thinking they are God and we are drug addicts. I didn't ask to get hit by a drunk driver.By the way I am not confused about anything I promise this practice will come to a halt, I am contacting everyone that is anyone, I understand the pricing etc! what I don't understand is how a doctor on the first visit makes you feel important and that she is going to help me and she did give me hope for the first time in years. On my first visit I told her I had been a marijuana smoker for 40 years and I had quit on 7-29-18 and seen Dr. Goyne on 8-21-18. I knew my drug test would come back dirty as it had not even been 30 days, she replied I don't usually write a prescription when a drug test is dirty but I believe you. My second visit on 9-19-18 my test was still dirty we looked it up and for a long term smoker it can take up to 100 days to get out of your fat cells. She then gave me half of my pain medication and was a complete doctor of which I first met. She made my next appointment for 11-3-18 to ensure I would be clean, upon checkout the girl called to ask about my prescription lapse and she was told that on the 19th I could pick up a prescription to last me till 11-3-18, Dr. Goyne assured me once my test came back clean she would resume my medication. After I get a call to go take a MRI which I did, the I was called to schedule a block, but at the same time I was told Dr. Goyne was not going to write me anymore pain meds and she called me in a prescription for withdraws and it cost $2200 hundred dollars. Insane, I have taken this medication since 2011 date of my auto accident, and this doctor takes a oath to do no harm which is exactly what she is done to me. She has lied promising she would resume my medication, and that i could pick up the prescription for the 10-20 to 11-03-18,, with no regards on how sick i am and how much worse it is going to be. Withdraw medication does not help with my injuries and the pain I live in. I am aware of your cost which are insane, I know this from my insurance company. So If i live thru this at my age after 7 years of use I will make it my mission to expose this company.\nSandra Pruitt", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9235b595d:0xf6d9a477ed0685db"}

Advised to go to this place after neck surgery. From the start the nurse that called us back, Lauren, was incredibly rude and unprofessional. She was the rudest person I have ever met in the medical field. Ordered to give urine sample, so I politely asked to see the dr first. So she said \"if you don't have anything to hide I should WANT to give a sample\". After her belittling us for the next 15 minutes we saw Goyne. No help what so ever. These Drs are strictly pill pushers in my opinion, not helping to find the cause of problem, just prescribing narcotics and off to the next room. I don't know if all pain clinics are like this, but I would stay away from this one. Overall lacking in cleanliness and patient care is non existent. Strictly a place to get prescription pain pills is primarily what they are used for. Not much of \"practicing medicine\". Oh and if you have a question for Goyne, forget it. She has no time. She's off to the next room to deal more prescriptions. Try another place. Any other place!\n\nI see where the response of my post from the clinic is for me to call them because customer satisfaction is a high priority. I don't think the office realizes I called twice to speak to Dr Goyne. Left my number. She NEVER returned my call and weeks later had someone in the front (receptionist maybe) call me back and suggested I come back and talk on next visit. I told them again I had couple concerns/questions I would like to ask Goyne before my next visit. Never heard back. But it\u2019s only been several months so maybe they\u2019ll call me one day.

They are truly two of the most knowledgeable medical professionals in the chronic pain field. Patient questions and concerns are thoroughly listened to and addressed at each visit. An insurance change caused me to have to leave a different reputable pain mgmt practice, and seek out a new Dr. Being extremely pleased at the other clinic, I searched for somewhere that I hoped would at least be close to as good(I decided that \"tolerable\" would work for the time being). I found Southside PS and gave it a shot. I liked Dr. Kendrick, but felt like some of the staff members back then (SEVERAL years back)viewed me as another drug seeker. I held on, tried to understand what they dealt with on a daily basis and decided to give it some time. One of the best decisions I've ever made!! It wasn't too long before I started noticing that those particular staff members weren't there and they were replaced with helpful and caring individuals who treated patients the way that we all would like to be treated. Dr. Kendrick is awesome, but his CRNP's make it to where he can do what he's actually there to do, and they handle the rest. Rickey and Stephanie have both gone above and beyond to help me with any issues that I may have, as well as ensuring that I do what I'm supposed to be doing in order to get the maximum benefit from my treatment. I came to them on certain medications that I had been taking for a while. I knew that upping the dose could be dangerous as well produce more issues down the road, given my relatively young age. I explained the issues that I was having to Rickey, and with my answer to a single question, he was able to remedy the situation... Without changing med, dose amount, or frequency! It was an extremely simple solution; however, not being a medical professional myself, it was not anything that I would have ever figured out/thought of on my own. The pharmacology associated with how the body distributes and metabolizes certain meds, is foreign to me. I am ever so thankful to Dr. Kendrick and his staff for helping me be the wife/mother/employee that I am today! With only 1-2 minor exceptions(and it's not every appt), I feel cared for and respected from the moment I sign in, until I walk out the door to leave.\nAs others have mentioned, it is difficult to reach them via phone. They have a solution for that too, that's extremely easy and convenient - Patient Portal. Just create your account, and you're set. I use it as my primary means of communication with the office. You pick your doctor's name, type of issue/question you have, and then start typing out the explanation or ask your question. There may have been 1-2 times that it's required a call back to me, but the overwhelming majority of the time, they are able to just \"email\" a response through my portal account. This is not  ideal for TRUE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES, thus the 911 system. A question or request can still be important and/or time sensitive, and not meet criteria for Emergency status, in which case, the only thing to do is send or leave a message and wait for the response. This may be an inconvenience to some, but I personally love that they've provided patients with an alternative way to contact them!\n(*This is not a \"pill mill\" so anyone who's just looking for a Dr who will write whatever prescription you ask for in mass quantities, needs to keep searching!)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9235b595d:0xf6d9a477ed0685db"}

I was with Dr.  Cockrell at Alabama Orthopedics for 3 years before he decided to no longer do pain medicine.  I did not like AOC, so I went looking for a new doctor in my area.  I found Pain and Rehabilitation.  At first things were ok, nice facility, staff, etc\u2026  I was trying to get my medication switched as well.  I was told the decision would be bases on a psychologist review.  I had my appointment with the psychologist and went over my history, etc\u2026  Psychologist was fine with everything and recommended they continue my medication.  Then things went bad.  I kept getting put off on my medication.  During this time, I had expensive tests done on me.  One was being shocked for 45 minutes to check my nerves (hurt like hell).  Next was putting a needle in my leg and shocking me some more (good lord, what the hay????).  Next, an injection while anesthetized.  I started getting a funny feeling when before every appointment I would get 3 calls to remind me to bring my Co-pay.  Before my injection, I got 5 calls to remind me.  Then I got a call Friday that they would not prescribe my pain medication I need to simply function.  Then it all became clear.  This place did not want to help, they wanted my money.  Multiple calls for co-pays, expensive (and very painful) tests, etc\u2026.  They claimed it was illegal to prescribe me my meds, but this is a LIE.  I actually called the Alabama Medical Board and DEA, it is up to doctor\u2019s discretion.  Wow.  So, if you want a bunch of useless and painful test, being bugged to bring your co-pay over and over, and being lied to, please go to Pain and Rehabilitation.

In 2008 I was injured and sought medical treatment for lower back pain. Upon several months of on going Dr visits and treatment I was unfortunately forced to undergo Two lower back surgeries which although did not rid my condition completely it did allow me to walk again and I chose to undergo Pain Management with the Center of Pain under the treatment of Dr Herrick. For the past 11 years I have seen Dr Herrick and he and his staff have provide a borderline comfort to ease my pain and give me my life back. Within these past 11yrs I have had to relocated south of his office in Montgomery to Gulf Shores which is roughly 175 miles and again to North Alabama roughly 200 miles away. Being unable to live a life with my family without suffering from daily pain. I am at The mercy of medical treatment. But Being so far away from the Dr Herrick I had to make a simple choice to find a new Dr or travel the 3hrs to continue treatment with the Center of Pain under Dr Herrick treatment. I have had one other Dr in the past 11ys administrate a Epidural to my lower back and I was not satisfied with the treatment nor did this Procedure help my pain. I wish not to speak bad on any other Dr or Pain Management Clinic but for me I have never had one bad experience or visit during my time with the Center of Pain. The staff has always gone above and beyond their means to ensure my visit and treatment has provide relief to my symptoms. Dr Herrick has always been understandable and provided a course of relief for me weather it be medication or procedure Epidurals.

I've got an inoperable problem & I've been to so many doctors in \u00ee  & Atlanta Georgia with no one knowing how to k k the>& use it properly are paying a high price with our quality of life. The walls in this was8MD's office are pasted with 11x8 peices of printer papers stating things about their rules, laws, business & more rules & regulations if u take any pain medication. Upon this being my new patient visit I was not impressed  my visit today especially as was directed to exit ... & btw stop at Lab 1st for a drug test. What? I've gotten no scripts from this MD, no thx plan, no instructions, no answers ... and yet they want a drug that I'll have to pay for if my insurance doesn't cover it. I could see if I was receiving care, medicine, treatment from MD, but for a consultation? I don't care about the test, I know I'm clean, but it makes u feel like your not trusted, dirty, bad person... just brings u down.  I understand why there's a need, but it could have either been omitted or instructed better instead of here being handed a cup, told to leave your purse, coat, & anything else outside of bathroom that u don't even have a sink to wash up until u open door & use community sinks.  So to sum it up... it was just a  okay visit that had opportunity to have been much more.

Dr. Meyer, however, did not change the medications I was taking that were working well for me, he simply adjusted the doses and took over the management of them because he is much more experienced in their uses for the control of chronic pain than the physician that was previously handling them had been. He immediately, upon my first visit, ordered new imaging (MRI), which was scheduled and done within a week of my first visit. Then in just one week from my first visit I received an epidural, which helped alleviate much of my constant unwavering pain in my hips and lower back area. He doesn't put you completely to sleep like the places I've been in the past have, where it was an all day event that involved an anesthesiologist. He does them either completely awake or if you're a little apprehensive like I was, offers Versed which helps alleviate much of the nerves and acute pain during the procedure. It was over with quickly and immediately following the procedure I rated my pain 3 points lower on the 0-10 scale, (at a 3 instead of a 6 like when I arrived) and within an hour it even got down to a dull ache instead of the sharper pain I normally experience in my hips. So that is incredible to me! My procedure was yesterday, so I am a little more sore today which is to be expected, but I'm icing it down every hour or so and using over the counter Salonpas Lidocaine patches. Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with Dr. Meyer, in my short time as his patient so far. He is a great bedside manner and his staff is absolutely wonderful!! His assistant in the procedure room was awesome and explained everything to me very thoroughly and answered all of my questions. (And I know I probably had a lot bc I get talkative when I'm nervous. \ud83e\udd23) The front office staff has been invaluable as well with scheduling and any insurance questions! He is very obviously not out to \"make you wait and take your money\" like I read that some silly person reviewed prior to me. I even tried to pay my $50 copay at my injection visit and the staff told me just to wait, because often times the insurance companies didn't charge copays on procedure visits, and they didn't want me to pay it if I didn't have to. Dr. Joshua Meyer and the nurse practitioner Hope Craft, FNP that I met, completely only came off as caring and that they are genuinely out to help you live a better quality of life with as little medication and as much activity as you can fit into it! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc97", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9845aaaaab:0xe341d42033b9ad2a"}

On my first visit, they found two diagnoses, one chronic syndrome and one likely fatal vascular condition, that had gone undetected by countless physicians for over 40 years. Their treatment of these conditions not only likely saved my life, but also greatly increased my quality of life. They offer chronic and acute treatment by a wide range of skilled specialists that is individually prescribed, adapted over time, and always representative of the most current and effective treatments and procedures. I've never encountered bad bedside manners from any physician or nurse. Even office staff is top notch. They are skilled and caring professionals whose goals are to know their patients, provide quality, individualized healthcare, treat a wide array of specialties, and reduce or eliminate pain for truly suffering patients. And because they provide such top-notch, organized, and quality care, they expect and require patients to be compliant, VERY timely, and willing to do their parts to improve their own lives. They are not a pill mill, so drug seekers need not apply.\n\nThe ONLY critique I have is that the practice and patient load is rapidly growing, so it has sometimes increased usually very short wait times and made it difficult to be flexible with scheduling appointments. But, they constantly ask for and respond to patient input, so they continue to actively modify their practices to improve these issues.

I use Weldons pharmacy and they absolutely will not fill my script until the day the doctor wrote the script for. Never has Weldons fill a script early. So they punish everyone because of what SOME pharmacy are doing. All Alabama pain has to do is have everyone bring there bottle in on there visit.

Been complaining of pain getting worse over the past few years, no changes. My dr left, then my replacement dr left. Still complaining of worsening pain so my fill-in, Dr Arrtie Pisaturo decides to REDUCE my pain meds after \"looking at my chart\". What?! I can't imagine what she possibly could've seen in my chart to come to this decision. I have felt for a very long time that I haven't been listened to, so there's no telling what the nurses have entered, especially considering it's very rare to see the same one more than once, and the patient portal is completely useless. All they seem to want to do is give you refills on your current prescriptions and get you out of there as soon as possible (I mean out of the exam room, because you have to go back to the waiting room and wait for an eternity to be given your prescriptions. They have to wait until the drs are between procedures to sign the prescriptions.). And no, I'm definitely not a drug seeker. I don't like being on opioids. I stressed this to my original dr and we discussed trying the Medtronic device when I talked to him before a spinal injection. I was so enthusiastic and told him I'd love to try it. That was the end of it. I didn't get to discuss it with him again because you're \"not allowed\" to see your dr unless it's your first visit as a new patient or when he talks to you right before you're wheeled in for a procedure. And I haven't had any more procedures. I feel like the patients are just paychecks to the drs and nothing more. I know its not just me because I hear conversations between other patients in the waiting room.

This showed that she was not listening to me, as I had said multiple times before that I could not take any NSAID's or prednisone due to a gastric sleeve surgery I had. I have suffered multiple heart-attacks as well as many health problems, and other traumatic and stress inducing experiences, such as a mother living with me and passing away.

When I first started going a neurologist referred me to him for some tests. When he gave me the results he said he could help me but he wanted the neurologist to refer me for treatment that he would not take a patient away from another doctor.  That showed me that he respected the other doctor. My first visit after that I was given a prescription. When I went back he suggested an epidural.  After the epidural did not give me much relief he said there was no need to do the epidural if they weren't going to work.  I was treated the next 3 years with medication.  He suggested maybe we could try the epidural again.  The decision was mine after he explained everything to me.  I have had epidurals regularly since then.  I see his Nurse practitioner Amy Harbin monthly.  She is great. She talks to you about your pain level and if I get any relief from the meds or how much relief I got from the procedures. When I get my procedures Dr Scherlis is fantastic.  He comes in and talks to you and he makes me feel he is truly concerned if what they are doing is helping me. Dr. Scherlis has helped me when I was fighting breast cancer and chemo, and many surgeries.  At this time, I have to get the epidurals and nerve blocks regularly for degenerative disc and pain from scar tissue. I have recommended Dr. Scherlis to many people.

Seeing that this is a consistent problem with scheduling and others are waiting hours in a literally packed waiting room and it's still an issue, certainly makes me think that the gracious feedback being given by others to help the office manager improve the practice means nothing to them and the replies promising to take care of things are evidently empty words. Please do something about hours of wait time besides just \"I'm sorry, I've shared your concerns.\" Words without actions to correct the problem are just as frustrating.

But let me tell the story of how long it took.  I started on June 8 trying to get in to see anybody about my back. It seems that an old injury had resurfaced, I called at least two times a week to get in. But to no response. I had a regular office visit on the 26th, in which they immediately set me up with an MRI. On the 27 th. The office called me on the 28th, and told me dr scherilis wanted to refer me to an neurosurgeon . But unfortunately the one that I saw on the 26th had written it up wrong, she said it happened at home, in which of course it did. I've been out of work because of that injury since 2008. Anyway the ones in billing charged it to my Medicare without my permission. I had no idea. Until I received the bill from the ones I got the MRI from. I began calling TVPC to let them know they were wrong in sending it to my Medicare, that the only reason I go to TVPC is on workers compensation only. Well anyway I fought and fought with first the ones in the office then with the ones in billing. They even charged my Medicare for an office visit I had to give a definition to workers comp. before they would okay my referral. Any way it went on since June 8 through sept 18 when they finally sent dr Parker all the info he needed through WC to get me in. Unfortunately the closet appointment they had was Oct. 23. So it has taken  a total of 5 months,living in excruciating pain to get in to get something done because of the ones in billing at the TVPC, I I called and sent e-mails to everyone that was in authority to try to help me. I even call my workers comp manager. And she told me she never got the correct paperwork from the Tennessee Valley Pain Center. They called me a week before dr Parkers office did to let me know that it was them in the office that screwed up, because of documentation on their part. But any way I am Finally getting to see someone that can help me. I'm going to try with all that's in me to get my workers comp. manager to change me to the TOC for pain management they have it all now. So if you read this whole story beware the office personnel and the billing personnel. They will get things screwed up and will not believe a thing you try and convince them of.

I started off their with the best Doc. and thanks to the staff my relationship that I thought I had with my Doc is not as it seemed. I gave a review on their website, but it was not posted. I'm guessing it was because I had nothing good to say about the staff. My Doctor and his nurse relocated to this office a few months ago. My first visit was good because I was allowed to see my Doctor. Now I know it was for show. After that day I would have a visit scheduled to see him, but would not get to. unless I insisted and had to get upset before they would schedule me to see him. They also were caught telling lies to MY Doctor, my Insurance co. and me.  They would say things like, they had talked to my ins co about my treatment and then tell the Doc that the Ins co was no help, when in fact they never called. It was confirmed by the ins agent in charge. They would tell me similar things. They also told the ins co and my Doc that I had discharged myself as a patient when I had said no such thing. For two weeks I was unable to get any messages to my Doctor. I found out later, when they admitted that they never took my messages.  I would not give this facility one star except you have to choose one just to give a review.  Before my Doc  came to this place I received the best treatment from him and his nurse, but since he relocated here I have not been able to get regular visits with him or get messages to him.

They spoke of him as if he were not qualified to do any task or treatment that he had done for me for several yrs. I fear that due to the staff at Tennessee valley pain consultants, I have lost a great Doctor of about 7yrs. If Dr. Kraus were not at this facility I would highly recommend him for your care, but as long as he continues to work there the care will never be the same. I am very disappointed that Dr. Kraus has not contacted me to resolve the issue.

I had pain from a hip fracture of my left leg and due to need of a knee replacement on my right knee.  But I couldn't have that done until my left hip issues resolved.  As one therapist put it \" You haven't got a leg to stand on!\"  So true.\n\nBut you know, in the entire 8 years I went to this pain clinic, I never once met the doctor whose signature was on the auto-printed refill scripts, already printed off before my appointment even began.\n\nFor a time, the psychiatrist I was seeing prescribed the drug Saphris for me for my depression.  That drug had the most insidious side effects. So insidious, I couldn't tell for sure whether the problems I experienced beginning months after first starting Saphris were from that drug or something else.  I told the psychiatrist this, and he doubled the amount of Saphris I was taking.\n\nWithin a year i was experiencing periods of sleeplessness that could last 3-4 nights in a row. I was tired but too restless to sleep.  I repeatedly lost my car keys, the glass of tea I had set down somewhere, and worst of all - my purse and/or cellphone.  This was particularly anxiety producing when it occurred when I was out shopping.\n\nI knew that the medications I took had to be kept in their original bottles. So, if I lost my purse shopping, I made a police report and then had to call my doctors to explain what happened. When I called my doctors to tell them of my predicament, I got refills (I had to pay for in full out of pocket) and I believe in the final year and a half I took this Saphris drug, I lost my purse six times!\n\nThe pain clinic recorded every call I made to explain what had happened again.  Also in that final year and a half of taking Saphris, although I felt fully capable of driving I still had six inexplicable car accidents. Luckily, no one was seriously injured.  But my car had to be loaded up and hauled away and twice my purse got left in my towed away car.\n\nOn these occasions, I had to call and explain what happened to my doctors and the pain clinic. The pain clinic refused to give me a refill.  But one of those times I found out where my car was hauled off to, and the next day was able to go and rummage through my car, find where my purse had landed in the accident, and thank God, nothing had been taken from it. I called all my doctors and the plain clinic back to cancel my refill requests, even calling the pain clinic to let them know I had recovered my pain med script.\n\nAbout 8 years into my medication treatment at the pain clinic, I was asked when I'd had my last pain pill. I told them honestly at that morning appointment I'd taken a last pain pill late the previous evening.  For the first time in my life I was asked to provide a urine sample.  I had no qualms about doing that because I had no reason to worry -- or so I thought.\n\nBut the nurse came back in and told me my urine sample results were negative.  1st drug test I'd ever had. NEGATIVE!!??  Why? How?  Can we repeat the test right now?  No?  I wa being immediately dismissed, and was told no, I couldn't talk to the doctor. Well, since I never had & had no idea what he looked like...\n\nI never once saw a real MD or DO there. The way they acted was mute testimony to the fact they had no interest trying to find out why the 1 & only test I'd ever had was negative. Asked to at least speak with the doctor.  I was scared. I'd heard you never just stop a drug you've taken a long time. I was forbidden doing that too!\n\n3 days later, form letter came.  Said I was dismissed for not following contract. Huh? 2nd form letter came next day. This one said I'd failed the drug test -was dismissed. Failed it? W/o further study, that's pretty dubious thing to claim.\n\nHad gone on Medicare that yr. MDs aren't reimbursed as much by Medicare. Likely THAT is real reason they wanted me gone!  Later called back and asked nurse what difference was between drug dependence and drug addiction. She couldn't answer that.  Long term pain med therapy often produces dependence NOT addiction!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213514df4f543:0xdc3cdbc4879dea48"}

The staff always had a smile on their faces, and treated me like family. The doctors I dealt with were very friendly, open to any questions/concerns. Awesome experience, everytime.\n\nLonger version, but adds great insight..\nI dislocated my knee years ago, and needed help FAST. I was without insurance but they said they could still help. They gave me a discounted rate, and began trying to treat me.\nIn short, i torn a ligament, and had to have surgery, so the doctor sent me to a colleague.\nFlash forward years later, and i'm having harsh pains in my lower back, from my work field. I return to this clinic, because of previous great services. My original doc wasn't working anymore, so i was taken in by Dr Kaul himself.\nThis continued for weeks, him helping keep my pain at a good, manageable level. I started to go less and less, as the pain started to simply vanish...Till...\nI got into a car wreck. My neck started to feel awful sore 2 days later, and i got worried.\nI then began looking for an accident lawyer, and through high google reviews, went to Moore's law-firm. I spoke with them, and was asked if i was being treated for the pain. I told them not yet, but i used to go to a local chiropractor, and was gonna go back very, very soon.\nI was asked where i went, and when told, the lawyer started laughing, the doctor, and the lawyer have been college for the longest time, and the lawyer sends hundreds of cases to Dr Kaul....Huh, small world..\nMy lawyer knows my doctor..\nSo to shorten this some, i was treated by Dr Kaul over a couple months, and even looked forward to it; talking to the staff, even becoming friends. The fact i felt so much better after leaving left a great association with the habit of going a couple times a week.\nAfter treatment, my papers were directly presented to Mr Moore, and he helped me with my case in a very straight forward manner.\nSo between these two professionals, and their staffs, i felt very taken care of, and confident that i was more than a $ symbol with legs.\nA++", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d12635cecc5:0x80d5f7984d2315ca"}

In just 2 weeks of treatment, I am moving more freely; sleeping soundly and feeling great!  Unfortunately, my back problem began to surface after a minor exercise routine, 2 years ago.  My husband suggested I find a chiropractor to see if that type of treatment would be helpful.  After checking reviews, calling several chiropractic offices and listening for a voice with a caring, understanding attitude, along with their ability to answer my questions, I found Mobile Chiropractic Associates.  Tonya, medical secretary/receptionist, took time to speak with me and answer my questions in a kind, courteous and unhurried manner.  I have received great care!  Dr. Douglas Kaul is very knowledgeable, is down to earth and doesn't pull punches. He shows and explains all he finds on the x-rays, which he takes himself.  He makes you feel comfortable; listens to your concerns regarding your treatment options and plan, answering any questions you may have.  Diane, his nurse, is very nice and engages you; always finding something to say to make you smile. As evidenced by the x-rays, my neck and lower back were slightly out of line and in that very first visit, I had an adjustment.  I didn't know what to expect during the process and Dr. Kaul explained everything and was gentle.  That day was the best I had ever felt in a long time and I am feeling even better, today! Dr. Kaul, his associates and staff have great compassion for every person who comes for help.   After your first visit, you will realize the care you receive is focused on getting you up and moving again, as pain free as possible.  Before you decide to give up; suffer through the pain; limit your activities and just take pain pills, epidurals or opt for surgery, find a well-qualified, caring, chiropractic physician.  I would like to suggest one such physician to you: Dr. Douglas Kaul at Mobile Chiropractic Associates.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d12635cecc5:0x80d5f7984d2315ca"}

Dr. Thacker did an injection treatment on it today and it was a miracle. The pain is non existent at the moment and im not hobbling around in pain. I am feeling so much better ever since i started as a patient of his. He has an excellent bed side manner and cares what you have to say and listens to all your concerns and takes his time. The downfall is the nurses will rush him out of the room. If it was subtle and not noticicle it wouldnt be so bad. But its not. But Excellent Doctor, Excellent Practice and good people. If you're lucky enough to get the nurse Charlotte and Dr. Thacker together thats a blessing!! Charlotte listens and really cares what you have to say without interruptions and is very professional. Best nurse and doctor ive come across in 20 years. 5 STARS!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ca9f0272bcd:0xd3dad948c181a60a"}

Front office staff was good. Dr. Thacker was great! Very thorough examination, felt confident with what he had to tell me. Was onboard with his plan, thought everything was going great. Then came the simple task of printing out prescriptions and leaving. The first set of prescriptions were incorrect, I thought ok life happens. Went back in let the receptionist know that the prescription was possibly printed out wrong. Nurse brought the Dr. out to \"explain\" the prescription to me. He \"explained\", left the reception area (really was a fan of having anything \"explained\" to me in the reception area especially by the Dr.) Nurse was then very adamant that the system is not wrong. I insisted, she resisted, but finally went back to check. I thought no harm, no foul, 10 minutes later the nurse comes out and hands me the \"corrected\" prescriptions. I said that I was sorry (wait what am I even sorry for) she said \"that's ok\". Make it to the elevator only to have them wrong AGAIN. I go back in let the receptionist know that maybe they printed out wrong again. The nurse comes out smirks, takes them back. A little quicker this time she comes out hands to me, \"corrected\" again. I get to the elevator and thinking noway they are wrong again, lo and behold, AGAIN. This by now had lost its \"no harm, no foul\" charm. I go back in she takes them back. I think of a possible issue with the prescriptions that the pharmacy may have. So, while she is about to make a copy of the prescriptions and has the Dr. sign it. I interuptered her and tried to mention the possible issue, only to be interrupted by what I gather is the nurse practioner to be told \"that is what the system says, so it is what it is\" tried couple more times to explain my concern to the point I was like just forget it. So, I am assuming that is the extent of my patient-Dr. relationship there, sadly. But, this is for anyone that may read this from this office. I suffer from severe depression and severe anxiety and no, not related to the pain (pain certainly doesn't help). I know you probably do not care but my world is practically falling apart. Now, pain has cost me my job and yea that stings for anyone but with the issues I suffer from I realize I am not capable of seeing the forest for the trees and decent coping skills. I was more than polite to everyone involved until my last encounter of being interrupted. But please remember people are not in your office because they want to be and for the love of God please understand that people have to deal with life's kicks outside of those walls of your office. Please just take the time to be kind with in reason. Thanks", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ca9f0272bcd:0xd3dad948c181a60a"}

The first day I walked in, he said he'd have me in \"Olympic shape\" in no time without even seeing what was wrong. I was paying him $100 a week to do therapies that ultimately didn't last more than a day for chronic back pain that I've been suffering for more than 7 years. Every week, he'd tell me something different that I'd need to do and would get aggravated at me because I couldn't afford to keep trying therapies that weren't working. But the kicker came when I finally started feeling a bit better by doing various exercises that helped me tolerate my constant pain better and I had an appointment where I was going to tell him I'd just delay the epidural shot we were planning. The night before, however, one of my boys started throwing up and had thrown up 5 times over the night and I had no choice but to cancel my appointment. I told them there was really no need for me to reschedule at the moment, that I was doing somewhat better and wanted to see how my body handled the new exercise. They said they'd have to charge me a $25 fee for an \"unacceptable cancelation\". Are you kidding me? How am I supposed to be able to control when my kids get sick? I'd been considering switching doctors to begin with because I didn't feel like he was meeting my needs, but that sealed it. So what about the almost 2 hours that I sat in the waiting room on my first visit past my appointment time? What about the time I've lost waiting for late appointments?

I moved from PA to AL in 2010 and had nothing but horrible experienced with the doctors down here. Seems all I was finding were ones that just wanted more money for less time and constantly being misdiagnosed. So badly I had to have an emergency Splenectomy because of a tumor that had grown in my spleen overtaking it. The kicker is Huntsville Hospital found it in 2010 and never told me. Needless to say I almost died.   That terrified me. I  didn't even want to seek medical care because of what I had already experienced. This left me in an enormous amount of pain. I found HPM in April 14' and read up on Doc and got a referral. Doc saved my life. He listened to me, evaluated me and not o lay gave me medication but did needle treatment. I went home crying. It was the first time I could touch my feet in years. My muscle was that bad around my L5 area. Within 6 months I was off disability and working at NASA. Finally able to lead a normal life. He cares. He doesn't force anything you don't want. He knew at one point I didn't have insurance so he didn't push extra things on me that cost money. He cared more about if I was ok. He's met my girls and my husband and I introduce him as the man who saved me. Yeah maybe there have been some iffy staff over the years but let me go on and tell ya they get in everywhere. Doc and his staff has done an amazing job at weeding them outa d keeping the ones that do a great job. He doesn't even like to Hear that someone was treated unfairly. He will fix it.

He has made such a difference in my life!  I can function day to day with my kids and do the things I need to do to be mom and a productive citizen!  Most pain clinics in our area have stopped any daily medications after the fall of Dr. Aggarwal, and unfortunately this affects the lives of many people.  Before I came to Dr Thacker, my pain management doctor was doing procedure after procedure and collecting that insurance money and my surgical copay month after month.  I could not get out of bed in the mornings.  I came to Dr Thacker and he not only got me on a daily pain medication regiment, but he also a total body workup and found vitamin and mineral levels along with hormones out of whack and gave me suggestions on what supplements to add and how much, and I have never felt this well before!  I wake up every morning close to pain free (compared to where I was before he came into my life) and energized!  He is open to alternative therapies like dry needling (like acupuncture) and other less conventional treatments like chiropractic and massage.  I love all of the nurses, they're all so sweet.  There's one young lady at the window, Wendy, Lindy, Lindsey, or Penny, (I can never catch her name but it sounds like one of those) she wears glasses and has long hair that has some curl to it.  She is so precious.  The other girl at the window has never mentioned her name, but she's skinny and her hair has been up the times I've seen her.  I don't care for her.  She's very cold and unwelcoming, and she only does the bare minimum to get buy.  Don't expect her to go out of her way for you on anything.  She's also on her personal phone every time I sign in.  The lady that did  my drug test at my first appointment, Shari was her name, is also rude.  I've been in an exam room and overheard her and skinny receptionist gossiping about a patient talking about they don't think he had a legitimate pain and he just comes through for medication.  The truthfulness of that doesn't matter, but that is between the doctor and the patient, not a sub par receptionist and a lady who plays with urine all day.  It's a shame I have to rate Dr T so low because of these two nitwhits, but they're the face of his practice.
