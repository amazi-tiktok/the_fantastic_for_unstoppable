You were the doctor that assessed his need; however you allowed a 23 year old young man to walk\u2026..walk is an overstatement\u2026.he left out of your office hunched over creeping like a ninety year old man. He wasn\u2019t given a shot for inflammation, pain, or a prescription for anything. He was only given instructions to WAIT for an MRI approval which could take a few days. A couple hours after he left, I called the nurse to request at least something for pain. I also explained to the nurse that he rarely ever takes any medicine only when it\u2019s necessary. Still he was given nothing.  Later that evening, I encouraged him to go to the emergency room because he was in so much pain. At this point that was his only option. It cost him five times his co-pay and triple the time for them to do what should have been done at your office that morning. They gave him a shot for inflammation and pain, and then advised him to make an appointment with Southern Bone & Joint. He has an appoint Monday July 2017.\n\nJust a little medical history of my son\u2026.it\u2019s literally a small amount of history\u2026.He hasn\u2019t gone to the doctor in over ten years. His last doctor visit was with his pediatrician. He doesn\u2019t even take over the counter medicine unless he absolutely can\u2019t cope with his sickness to perform as a mechanic at work.\n\nI can\u2019t believe you allowed him to leave without doing anything for him.\n\nA very upset mother.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892920af43e1883:0x9a95daa8defe8270"}

Went to First Med yesterday because I was suffering from sinus infection for over a month. I was being treated by a different Medical Practice who will remain nameless and I had actually seen them three times trying to get some real help and they just kept telling me it's allergies and wouldn't take it more serious so I finally went to first Med.  I told the doctor my symptoms, swollen painful glands, pain kept moving from left to right  sometimes in the middle and it really hurt when I swallowed, congestion in my chest (that ugly colored stuff) coughing so hard my ribs felt they're going to crack  congestion in my nose headache eyes ache Etc and NP Baldwin examined  me and treated me as I expected to be treated in a doctor's office and gave me the necessary medicines to finally get rid of this bad sinus infection / cold. He was extremely nice, very professional and knowledgeable, helpful and he actually took time to listen to me and explain things which was so wonderful that's very rare for a doctor these days. And oh my gosh one of the ladies I saw was Karen she was a stitch, had a great sense of humor. I highly recommend 1st med. they're in the middle of renovating so just be patient as I'm sure it will look very beautiful very soon.  the floor is beautiful and the wallpaper too in the back. Everyone was super nice and friendly. Oh and I was a walk-in I got there about 645. There had already been a couple other people and I think I was seen pretty quickly, about 30 minutes, considering evidently they do appointments also. I saw some reviews that the wait was really long but mine was not that long at all and there were actually probably seven different  patients in the waiting room at different times but they got called back pretty quickly and so did I as a walk-in. Thank you again so much First Med for being there for me! I'm already noticing a difference in the right direction. PS ladies do your hair I felt so bad I went in looking like I don't know what but it doesn't hurt that this doctor is easy on the eyes so you might want to take an extra minute LOL. No disrespect mrs. Baldwin good for you both! It's just nice to meet a really nice person who is nice looking and a doctor. Pretty rare.

I had a horrible cough during that and developed a hard pressure in the upper center part of my stomach which is pushing on my ribs and heart (possibly vagus nerve) I explained all of this to the doctor that I seen and told him I was having problems breathing since it started, much worse when I sat down. I also explained to this doctor that I had been taking meds for migraines but had ran out and needed a refill. Once this doctor found out I was a smoker, he seemed to not even care at all. He blamed everything on smoking. I had my 12 year old son in the room at the time and this doctor literally drew a graph of how long I was going to live on the bed paper. He terrified my son!!! I knew then I'd never see that man again! Instead of checking to see what the pressure was and instead of refilling a med I had been taking for 12 years he put me on Buspar. The first night I took that Buspar the pressure increased so bad I could hardly move! I'm also now having to take bp meds since all of this. I'm 34 years old, I should not have all of this going on and for it to hit like it did all at once. And instead of this doctor trying to help me he terrified my son! He also prescribed me Naproxen which luckily I didn't take because I went to St. Vincent where they done at egd and found I have chronic gastritis as well as reflux esophagitis so the Naproxen could have caused a stomach bleed... I've seen another doctor here who is better than the first but I am still having the same issues. I'm honestly believing a stuck hiatal hernia or something else has been missed. The new doc put me on zantac which didn't help either. I feel no better, in fact I feel worse than when I did when I went to try and get help here about 5 months ago.

Dr. Honeywell ordered his staff to make me pay any do amounts before they would see my son each time he had an appointment. Being on a fixed income this is difficult. But my son needing his medicine was more important so I would scrounge up the money and pay it.\nAll of that is not too big of an issue until the last appointment before he had changed primary doctors. he was getting ready to go off to college and they refuse to see him unless I paid a no-show fee that I had canceled prior to them claiming that I owe them $50 for the no-show. keep in mind I have showed them the text where I had called and cancelled the appointment they still claim I owe them the money. And refused to sign off on an immunization form he needed for college. Not knowing, I could have had it signed by any physician, they were willing to ruin his chances of going to college. For a $50 no show fee?!! This is a doctor that has been seeing my son for nearly 17 years! Never having a problem collecting any deductibles( although late sometimes, due to the fact I wasn't aware...)and getting paid through the insurance company.\nIt breaks my heart that Dr. Honeywell held captive a piece of paperwork over $50! Especially, the lack of compassion that Honeywell has expressed with a loss of my son's father, and my husband.16+ YEARS!!!\nAlthough, this explains why the office does not accept Medicaid.

I have a few ongoing medical issues with my kidneys and my heart, as well as chronic migraines, so it was vital to find a good GP, and fast. After about six months of suffering one disappointing GP after another, I was telling a (then) new Huntsville friend how overwhelmed I was trying to find just one decent doctor seeing new patients, and she recommended Dr. Chris O'Halloran. She and her husband had been seeing him since their R&D transplant from Texas two years before us. Dr. O'Halloran, she said, \"stops at nothing to get to the bottom of what's going on with you.\" She went on to say that together she and Dr. O'Halloran had discovered the root cause of her own migraines and was treating her with a preemptive medication that had cured her condition. She also said that her husband had begun having trouble with his heart, and that Dr. O'Halloran knew exactly the place to refer him for excellent treatment.\n\nThankfully, Dr. O'Halloran was seeing new patients, so for well over a year now I have been able to see for myself, time and time again, that my friend's recommendation was on point.

I followed the steps as described but was on hold waiting for my provider for one hour. This urged me to call  the office and Sheila Clements lacked all principles of customer service and only wanted to express her point of view saying Nonchalantly stating she called and left a voice message . I checked and didn\u2019t have record of her call but then she proceeds to ask for copay. At that point I felt I should pay after my appointment considering my experience and uncomfortable considering her decorum or lack their of to give her a payment before my appointment considering my experience. Dr Barmore may be a fair physician but she should reassess who works in her office and comes in contact with her patients before seeing her.

The CNA who worked me up asked about it, so either she didn\u2019t get it or just didn\u2019t look at it.\n\nThey were very uncommunicative on the portal. I asked about my thyroid levels (what I have to go to a PCP for and what the visit was about) and my A1C. The CNA communicated with me about the A1C, but I had to prompt her again about the thyroid levels, and she never responded on the portal.\n\nAnd only a 2-month supply of my thyroid meds was called in to my pharmacy, so I\u2019ll either have to keep bugging them about it, or plan to pay another copay and see the MD again in 2 months when I need refills again. They also didn\u2019t run a T4 lab to check how my levels were on my current dose, just a TSH and A1C.\n\nThe visit I had in June 2020 with Dr. Barmore was amazing, but this visit fell extremely short.

If it were possible to give less stars I would do so.\n\nI have never been treated so disparagingly or with such utter patronizing disdain from a medical provider in my entire life. Gaile Prentice CRNP (not even a medical doctor mind you) was assigned to me when I called in for a general wellness check over a year ago.  After a not so pleasant initial experience with a CRNP who was clearly not well trained or very competent for that matter I thought I'll try again when I call back next time for another appointment with another doctor. Unfortunately you are assigned the same doctor for LIFE at this practice.\n\nThis is the most absurd practice concept I have ever heard of. Instead of seeking the best doctor patient relationship this practice cares more for administrative duties and collecting as many co pays as possible.\n\nAs my wife accompanied me to my appointment literally in tears pleading for  help with managing my general anxiety we were met with ZERO SYMPATHY and were denied a refill of an very common anti anxiety medication I have used in the past on multiple occasion when it was absolutely necessary to do so (valium).\n\nRather than attempting to dig into the problem she exasperated the issue and the most she would do was refer me to a psychiatrist. Never mind in Texas with my  primary care doctor I was able to get prescription refills without ever having to see such a doctor. They were more than competent and experienced enough handle simple issues like these.\n\nI was treated with contempt and my personal integrity was questioned on multiple occasion regarding a medication I have been taking literaly for years.\n\nDo not waste your time with this practice. Do not waste your time with Gaile Prentice, she is utterly unsympathetic, contentious, and unqualified as a Certified Nurse Practitioner to act as a primary care provider.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886265774d3585eb:0xdade2efa9001babe"}

The nurse said just come Friday morning, we are open half a day, ok that\u2019s fine. So today I tried to register just as I was told to do and it didn\u2019t have an option for Covid follow up so I called the office, explained it to the nurse she said let me call you right back. Ok, I waited and waited, finally someone from CORPORATE called me explaining they didn\u2019t have anymore vaccine to give. WHAT?? She started out telling me well you were suppose to be here yesterday. I stopped her and said hold on , I told the nurse I could come but it would be 6:00 and she told me to come the next day,I even called WEDNESDAY and told them again I could come but again I was told to come Friday!  I didn\u2019t do that on my own! She said well she didn\u2019t have the authority to tell you that. After going back and forth she said she was gonna have to find me a vaccine and it would take her a week! So guess what Iam not a happy camper. I told her Iam in healthcare and I am pretty upset for being able to get it because if their mistake. Am I wrong for this?? I know this is all new and I realize mistakes happen but come on give me a break! I have pts and family members to think of!!  Still upset!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0b9bb45338a3:0x9bd3bb0761aa5633"}

I asked her why she had to say \"...it's B.E.G.,\" and she responded that with those policies it was necessary to have a primary care physician in order to receive medical care--which I knew, and which is why I was there in the first place (See sentence #1 of this review). She accessed the information related to my policy, then proceeded to tell me who the family member's PCP was; I told her that the doctor she mentioned was MY doctor and NOT the family member's.  She then went on to say that without a PCP we would have to pay for the visit out of pocket, and I once again informed her that the whole reason we were there was to establish a PCP--was she actually suggesting that we needed a PCP in order to get a PCP?  She then dismissively asked, \"So, what do you wanna do?...\"  Dumb question, since I had stated my reason for the visit more than once.

My family and I moved to Mobile, Alabama for our last move as we intend to live here for the rest of our lives.  Well as in any place you live there are many good things and there are not so good things that you experience.  We just came across a not so good thing and that is the Alabama Medical Group, P.C.  We were only with this PCM and the medical group for 3 or 4 months when we received in the mail a letter from them dismissing one of my family members.  The letter did not state any reason why only that they \u201cneed to do this from time to time.\u201d  When asked why our family member was dismissed their representative would not provide a reason and on top of that they were rude during our phone conversation.  As a Navy Captain (retired) who has been to many places in this world along with my family who have been with me through all of that,  this has been the most disappointing experience of my career and was upsetting for my family members.  As a result of this,  my entire family has now changed PCMs.  I hope this feedback will help the management of Alabama Medical Group to self reflect and make some changes for the better.

I have to call at least 5 times before I can get an answer. One time I attempted to contact them for days just to get a refill called in for my sons Epi pen. If I was on my phone leaving this review I would screen shot my call log to show that I called 6 times in the last 30 minutes with no answer.\n\nYou can try leaving a message but your call will not be returned.\n\nWhen they do answer they never have appointments.\n\nWhen you are lucky enough to get an appointment your wait time is going to be at least 2 hours.\n\nPros:\n\nThe facility is very clean\n\nSince they never have appointments they are very good about referring you out to other doc in the boxes so that your insurance will cover the cost of going elsewhere.\n\nMost of the staff is friendly.\n......................................................................\nOn our first visit they couldn't wrap their heads around why we were actually there. My son needed a referral to have allergy testing done, the only way to get one is to visit your primary care physician. They kept asking if I wanted to get him monthly shots for his allergies or an inhaler even after I had explained several times why we came.\n\nThe school year is almost over and they still haven't called me in another Epi pen refill. I am sharing mine with the school daily....\n\nAll in all if it wasn't for the fact that I live in the boondocks and I don't want to have to drive 30 miles to a doctor Tricare approves I would NEVER keep this doctors office.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889b708d10ce9fd:0x7b5fc7185ac041cc"}

Some forms require an appointment because of the time or information required. Often, forms necessitate researching a patient\u2019s history, medications, labs and other correspondence. This then becomes the liability of the practitioner who signs the form. And then there are some forms that are much less extensive and may be filled out at the end of our patient schedule. (Though this policy is among the policies addressed in the new patient paperwork, you can also view our policy on third party forms on our website.)\n\nRegarding the incident in your comment: the two forms that we did complete for you at the time of your visit were completed at no additional charge. The other three pages that you brought in later and that you asked to be filled out while you waited required unscheduled time that we had to manage without affecting other patients. We are sorry you thought that charging for this was unreasonable.\n\nWe do understand the frustration with the other charge you mentioned, but that is due to insurance rules. Guidelines state that a wellness visit addresses health maintenance and illness prevention. Once we address other issues and prescribe medications in treating those issues at a wellness visit, it becomes a different kind of appointment. Depending on the agreement between patients and their insurance carrier, patients may have a separate copay for this office visit.  Because of this, some doctors require that a separate appointment be made, entirely. We opted to address it during the one visit to spare an additional trip and any additional time away from work or school-- something for which most of our other patients are grateful."}, "gmap_id": "0x886213556ad63c73:0xec4d3a206cb14af0"}

Every time, I waited between 30 minutes and an hour past the time of my appointment before being seen.  They really like to request lab work from the same place, which seems suspicious to me.  Almost every time I went, they filed the insurance wrong.  Double check that everything is in network before they do it, because they will file however they please and screw you over.  If you are desperate, don't want to go to a walk in clinic, and just want a prescription for your symptoms would be the only way you should go here.\nI had pain in my hip/groin area, they did a urine test and requested STD testing (I'm a married man), told me they would call with results and work on figuring out what was wrong.  I waited a week with no response, when I called, they said oh your STD results were fine, just take some Aleve for the pain.

I did not have any other symptoms except for the cough but went because I didn't want to be constantly coughing at work and Dayquil wasn't helping anymore. I left with out any real diagnosis and a prescription for an antibiotic and a cough medicine. The cough medicine had absolutely no effect and after finishing to round of antibiotics there was no change in my cough and it has only gotten worse. I called up there to see if they could potentially reexamine me. Unlike every other urgent care that I have ever been to they told me I would be charged a copay to be reexamined. If I had known this was their policy I would have gone to an urgent care in Auburn like I usually do as they care more about me getting better than me paying a copay and don't charge one for reexaminations. They did call in a new cough medicine prescription however it is a decongestant even though I have absolutely no congestion symptoms. It was also not covered by my insurance so I was forced to pay out of pocket. I will not be returning to this urgent care in the future.

No more signatures, no more paperwork, no more just answering some questions for me. I went to his office one day last week. There were 2 people in the waiting area. Yet, every room was full, and he was too busy to give me 5 mins of his time to explain to me why he didn't read the physical therapist notes stating that my Mom needed a hospital bed. I was willing to wait all day for a few minutes of his time, and he sent his nurse to tell me that he couldn't see me until after flu season!  I honestly don't think he can hear or read. Now, with that being said, if you need a very large puzzle put together, he's your man!

He told me go to Flowers hospital and have them check it out. I didn't even make it through triage before they wrote a script for the same antibiotic I already had. They acted like I was seeking dope. I went to dr lassiter for an appointment for something totally different. He saw my face and immediately said it was bad. Did bloodwork, helped me in so many ways. What's wrong with you people?  Try seeing it from the doctor's perspective. They are here to help. Would you rather him lie and treat you elderly parents for things that aren't going to help? Maybe he sees it like he could be helping a child or someone who is dying of cancer at 21, or maybe he didn't want them to be in the office during flu season.  Maybe.......I KNOW HE IS A GREAT DOCTOR! TAKE IT FROM ME, YOU COULD BE TREATED MUCH WORSE. GO TO JAIL AND COMPLAIN ABOUT HEALTHCAR.

My husband was a patient and my kids have seen him too.  i used to really like the care Dr. Lassiter provided.  In fact, I've even recommended him to friends in the past.  However, over the last several years, I've totally lost confidence in him as a doctor.  Before my father passed away, we were trying to work to get some VA paperwork submitted.  We had worked for a couple of weeks on getting a response from Dr. Lassiter.  Finally got a call from his office on the afternoon we buried my father, who ended up passing away unexpectedly.  More recently, we've been trying to secure a hospital bed for my 90-year-old mother who suffers from dementia and now requires full-time care.  She's had many falls and several months ago, she actually fell getting up from her bed and broke her arm.  Dr. Lassiter suggested we get home health to come do an evaluation to determine if she needed the bed.  Home health came, did the evaluation and in no uncertain terms determined she needed a hospital bed.  Home health submitted the paperwork to Dr. Lassiter and when he filled out his portion of the paperwork, he wouldn't approve for her to get the bed. In another instance just last week, I called his office one morning because my mother had become very ill.  It's flu season, so I wasn't sure if I needed to bring her in and risk her getting the flu, or if he could call some medication in for her.  He had just done a physical on her several weeks prior.  I didn't hear back from his office until 5:00 in the afternoon.  By that time, I had already taken my Mom to the emergency room where she was treated for a severe case of bronchitis.  In the last couple of days, we've tried to get an antibiotic called in for my mom because she has developed a urinary tract infection.  Dr. Lassiter wouldn't do it because he said the antibiotic she was prescribed at the hospital for bronchitis should take care of that too.  Obviously, it hadn't taken care of it or she wouldn't have the UTI.  He told me a couple of years ago when my Mom was very sick that there was just nothing else he could do for her.  And I guess he was right!  Because he definitely hasn't done anything for her since that time!  Just because you're 90, doesn't mean you don't deserve good medical care!  In spite of all of this, he has had some wonderful staff members through the years.  Although, I've noticed he's lost a bunch of good ones over the years.  I can only guess that they got tired of making excuses for him when he wouldn't respond to his patients. I also noticed that he went from being on his own in a practice, then his practice was affiliated with Southeast Alabama Medical Center and now his practice is affiliated with Flowers Hospital.  I have to wonder if there's a reason for all those changes as well.  At any rate, now  he will have two less patients to worry about.  Mom and I won't be back except to collect our records to take to another doctor.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d90b45d4c11:0x96de7724c8de8582"}

They told her that it would cost 70.00... When I asked to speak to the young lady, (Amber or Amanda) she got on the phone and I asked how come they didn't give her an option to pay before she left.  This ______ said, \"We don't see ANY PATIENTS without them paying upfront... I let her know that MONEY was a problem however you just don't send a baby however when in fact they are suppose to be seen soon after coming out of the hospital... She then gave my grand daughter mother the phone back without saying anything...  I then told my grand daughters mother to leave because at this point I felt like we were taking my PUPPY to a veterinarian and not my grand daughter to a pediatrician... To me they made us feel like she was an un-necessary animal that we just wanted and not what we needed.  We will now do business in Columbus and not even worry about this Pediatric Center...

So I was an  hour late for my job to find out no orders had been sent over, and then when I called was told that Dr Wright would send be for lad work after my appointment , so I did not understand this because wouldn't that mean I would have to go back AGAIN to get the lab results . Oh and at the time I called about the lob work I also informed the receptionist that I was now on Medicare and did they accept it, she said yes we do, never told me that because of the change from BCBS to Medicare that I would have to fill out additional forms because now it isn't an annual physical  it's a wellness check ( what a bunch of bull). So when I showed up for my 7:30 appointment this morning , first of all the receptionist ask me what I was there for ( I made the appointment a year ago for my physical , you should know what I am here for)  then I said remember I am no longer on BSBS so do you need my Medicare care?  Oh by this caused a disturbance, Oh we can't see you at 7:30 if it is Medicare you have forms to fill out, we will need to reschedule.  YOU KNEW I HAD MEDICARE !! So they wanted to reschedule , so another hour missed from work and still have never seen Dr. Wright. So No I did not reschedule I walked out of the office !!!!! So mad!!!

We told our friends about what a great experiance we had, and recommended the establishment to others.\nSo today, December 23 I took my daughter back to get tested for Covid 19, since our test were positive.\nIn my 48 years I have only experienced two other so called CRNP's as bad as the Donna Conway treated me today.\nShe bad mouthed Mr. Wilcoxson in how he practices and the decisions he makes. I pleaded to her to change my daughters prescription over to what my husband and I were taking which is not against the law nothing illegal and she could have totally made me feel better as mother and understand ultimately I know my daughter best, she is not just a math equation.\nEverything I said to her she used words like \"debunked\", when I am the paying customer.\nI was shocked.\nJust because what I was requesting did not fall into her agenda and I pleaded with her, she chose not to make me assured as a parent my daughter is getting  the right treatment. Not to mention she wrote my daughter for an inhailer and no one even listened to her lungs. Using an inhailer when you don't need it can cause more damage than good.\nAfter I stated that fact, she then listened to my daughters lungs and said she sounded clear.\nI am so appalled by her lack of bedside manner and inability to connect with the concerns and needs of the patients.\nOn our previous visit we were invited to sign the kiosk about our experience. Today Donna Conway made sure to skip that option. When I asked the front desk receptionist to please load the kiosk for me it only allowed me to enter 1 as my satisfaction, when I went type the reason why, someone conveniently shut it off and the receptionist could not reload it.\nSo there's that.\nIf this Donna Conway continues to be employed at your establishment, I will make it my daily mission to make sure through ALL of my media connections that people call first and only visit the Care Center when Troy is working.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889046071922300f:0x23b6c7003fb99cdc"}

I was looking for a family doctor, to treat everyone and came upon Grandview. They have an online scheduling system, so I used that for myself and my two daughters. Long story short, they called me a week prior to the appointment and told me they were canceling my appt for my youngest daughter because she is under 12. I mentioned my older daughter would need to be canceled as well, as she is also under 12. They informed me that they had canceled hers the week prior, but didn't call me. I verified I still had an appt, for myself on the 17th, they said I did. A few days before the appointment I got an email reminder for my daughter ,that was supposed to have been canceled already, but not for me. The morning of the appointment I woke up not feeling well. I called the office ,as it was a well visit, and asked  if I would need to reschedule or do a telemedicine visit. I was informed that they definitely would NOT see me, because I was sick, and they don't want ANY sick patients in the office, but they also told me I didn't have an appt. anyway because they had accidentally deleted my appointment and left my youngest daughters on, then canceled hers that morning (again without calling),  and had already filled the appt with another patient. On the following Monday (the 22nd) I received a voice mail. I didn't hear the phone and was still not feeling great. When I checked my voice-mail I was greeted with a SERIOUS attitude of someone who didn't realize the voice box had picked up. \" I called this lady LAST week. I Dont't know, oh hold on!

She was very sweet, but ibbelieve she lacks and experience and I don't want to risk my health continuing to see someone who doesn't care enough to check me out thoroughly.\n\nWell I haven't been to see a primary doctor in quiet some time. I've gone to the E.R or one of those doc-n-box places, so getting a full routine checkup was LONG overdue and I was a bit nervous.\n\nMy fanily has been riding me about getting a routine psychical and getting a full body check up, which is what I told the receptionist when I made appointment that I wanted.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was a bit sketchy about the location it was in a super odd spot and the office was so \"dead\". I found it strange and started to get freaked out a bit.\nWhen I walked into the office, I felt a bit more relaxed.\n\nThe receptionist was a bit odd, but that didn't bother me much.\nThe nurse, Alicia was friendly and super helpful.

But I chalked it up to well we don't know either other and decided to come back for my physical. Well! This is where I was totally shocked at the lack OF the physical.  Her first question to me was, \"what do you want to do?\" I was a bit caught off guard and then started to talk about what my previous doctor in Atlanta would do during a physical.  She wanted me to call my insurance to make sure labs were covered, WHICH okay I can appreciate that but again they typically are. I agree with the comment before of not wanting to touch people.  In my opinion I completely wasted my physical because she didn't perform one! My visit consisted of being on the phone with BCBS confirming I'm covered (which I was) and that was primarily it.  I think she's a nice lady but as far as what I am looking for in a doctor she's not it for me.

I fell on a flight of stairs and badly broke both the radius and the ulna of my forearm, below the wrist. The bones were badly out of place and I was very shocked and freaked out. We walked into the emergency room and it was a serene and quiet atmosphere. They told me I would be put into a room as quickly as possible and it happened very soon. People started tending to me immediately and I was given pain medicine. An x-ray machine was brought to the room so I was able to stay in bed while they did the films. As soon as they had the information from the x-rays, they gave me a \u201cwaking sleep\u201d anesthesia while they moved the bones back into position (called reduction.). I felt nothing during the procedure, thank goodness.  When I woke back up, the pain was gone and my arm had been splinted so that the bones couldn\u2019t move out of place. They put my arm in a sling and started asking me which doctor I would like to use for the surgery. We had no idea and started scrambling for information. We made some calls, and it was a week before anyone could even see us to evaluate.  The doctor who splinted my arm, Dr Herring, strongly suggested the orthopaedist in the building, Dr Stephen Gould. We looked Dr Gould up and he came from Johns Hopkins Hospital, so we thankfully said \u201cYes!\u201d  Dr Herring had been sending all my films and information updates to Dr Gould from the  time I arrived. He was ready to see me that afternoon!  We simply walked down the hall from the room I had been in and I saw Dr Gould after a short wait. My surgery was scheduled in a few days and it happened at Medical West Hospital in Bessemer. There I had another Excellent experience from the UAB Health System!  The bones and incision have healed beautifully and I am sold - I am changing doctors so that I will be using this health system from now on. Thank you to Dr Herring and Dr Gould and staff who cared for me so well.\nAnne Sockwell\nHoover, AL", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921a9979e2dbb:0xf969829d4902293d"}

My mom asked how much MRI would be, the nurse told her a $40 copay, also Med Ctr West Radiology told her it would be a copay of $40 when she arrived for the MRI, gave her a receipt for $40 showing no balance due but she gets billed later for $160 more dollars! Her credit is perfect, has  never filed a complaint nor negative review in her life! But I am for her because she hand wrote this doctor explaining everything, its been months and he nor his staff never contacted her! Now she is getting collections letters!  After hearing her for months upset but now understanding, I have gotten involved!!! I fight cancer and I have been fighting 9 yrs so I am familiar with the medical field and billing - errors do happen on their part! They are not beyond making a mistake! Radiology at UAB West who did the MRI should have told her the correct copay amount before getting the scan! To assure the patient can pay before services rendered and to assure they get their money. It is common courtesy and practice for a pre-scheduled test or scan like that for the staff to have the correct copay available for the patient! Well they did not and on the phone and speaking to whoever was over billing at UAB West the lady got very rude and and said my mom should know what she should have paid~ I have never heard of such and they need to learn how to treat customers, last I check, patients and insurance companies pay their salaries!

Personally, if you are considering this place, I would just run like H3LL.  I had symptoms of acid reflux and had an ENT confirm what I thought it was.  I asked to get an endo done just to ensure my throat did not have Barrett's.  They referred me for the procedure and one of the female doctor's performed the endo.  Prior to this I had never met this doctor.  I explained my acid reflux and she said it could be my gallbladder since I had a child 1.5 years prior.  She recommended an ultrasound and hyda scan.  I went in for both and it was found that I did have a gallstone.  The hyda scan was normal.  The gastro doc immediately referred me to a surgeon to have my gallbladder removed.  I was blown away!  I had never had any typical gallbladder attacks or pain.  After doing more research I found out that having your gallbladder removed can actually cause bile reflux due to the constant free flow of bile into your system once the gallbladder is removed and the bile has no where else to go.  This doctor could not even read details of my ultra sound so I had to rely on some random doctor (over the phone) to tell me that yes, I have a rather large stone.  This female gastro doc never made any follow up appointment with me.  I immediately canceled the surgery.  I have since discussed this decision with other doctors (ENT and family doctor) and they agree with my decision.  My one gallstone while big is not currently causing typical symptoms.  There is absolutely no guarantee that removal of my gallbladder will fix the acid reflux.  And, recently, my acid reflux has been manageable with a proper clean (and green) diet. Folks, after doing much research, I am convinced that probably millions of Americans have gallstones.  Why?  Diet, it's that simple.  Our diet is just too high in fat, salt, and sugar amongst other things.  A lot of people have gallstones without even knowing UNLESS they have a gallbladder attack that lands them in the ER (or in my case was found just by chance).  In my opinion, gallbladder pain and recurrent attacks are reasons to remove the gallbladder.  Yes, you can live without your gallbladder but you can also live without your arm.  Your body functions better with both so unless you are having issues, think really hard about whether it's worth losing an organ.  In very rare cases, gallbladder disease in the form of stones can lead to major illnesses like cancer.  However, IF you drastically improve your diet, I do believe you can control your destiny.  Remember, everything begins in the gut!  Obviously, I am not a medical doctor, so these opinions are my own.  My last words of advice: get 2 or 3 opinions and remember that doctors are in the business to make money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a680bf0c7d7:0x1d6cad2459ca0d12"}

However, she told me about telehealth.  I told her multiple times I wanted an appointment after work.  She pushed the telehealth, and I chose that option.  She still managed to schedule me for an in-person appointment.

She has such a calming way about her that puts you totally at ease. She makes you feel comfortable and you feel totally at ease speaking with her. Her staff are super nice and professional. I highly recommend Dr Donohue as my primary internist. She is fabulous and I am so glad that I found her!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1619184345838, "text": "Thank you for your kind words and this wonderful review!

And then when we spoke with Dr. Williams, he immediately dismissed my wife's feedback saying, \"I can tell your thyroid isn't swollen just be looking at it\", \"you're probably anemic or have low iron\".\n\nOne ultrasound and multiple blood tests later - surprise!  Her thyroid in enlarged, she's not anemic and the remaining panels came back negative.  Despite this, we can't get a referral to an endocrinologist and he can't explain why her TPO levels are high and she has the symptoms she does.\n\nI've spoken with 2 other docs that have recommended an endocrinologist based on the very first blood test we brought Dr. Williams.\n\nEnd of the day, Dr Williams was very dismissive of our concerns, seemed to have already made up his mind because we had blood work done without his \"consent\".\n\nI wouldn't recommend Dr. Williams for anything more than the most basic care, and certainly not for anything that might involve a diagnosis or support that's not routine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621356a60cb715:0x625471fa31d955f0"}

After seeing some specialists in the last few months for some allergy problems I've really seen how GOOD ATTENTIVE doctors treat their patients.\n\nHe RUSHES through appointments and will be walking out the door as your still talking. I've more than once had to loudly interrupt him or get the nurse to bring him back because he treats his patients like a paycheck. Each time I've went I've waited an hour or more for 5 minutes of him talking quickly and running out before I can ask anything.\n\nHe was very rude and condescending to my husband about some delicate matters. My husband has not liked him since day one.\n\nHe is not very invested in diagnosing problems. For both me and my husband he's ordered tests for problems we've had, but when results came back clear he didn't do anything else. It was like the thought bloodwork would somehow cure an illness. No referral to a specialist. No follow up visit. Just a phone call from a nurse saying the bloodwork didn't show anything. Not helpful and definitely not what I want in a doctor.\n\nThe office staff is horrible about getting back to calls. They have not called me back almost every time I've called. As it stands now I don't have a refill for asthma meds that Dr. Williams was very serious that I take regularly because I called for a refill and no one called me back to tell me I needed to come in for an appointment. Finally after over a week I called back and left a hateful message and finally got some service.\n\nBut I'm not going to come in every three months and pay a co pay and wait for over an hour for a condition I've had for 20 years that I need daily medication for. It's just greedy on their part. I've never in my life had a doctor that expected me to manage my asthma this way.\n\nI HATE this practice. At this point I'm searching for a primary physician in the height of the worst season for my asthma, unmedicated, because of the laziness and greediness of this practice.\n\nDo not waste your time or copays.

I have a history of kidney stones. I have been seen at AFC twice within the past several months with kidney stone like symptoms- pain, blood in urine, vomiting. The doctor I saw a few months back at a Birmingham location was very nice. However, I have relocated and visited the clinic in Tuscaloosa. The doctor I saw today was rude and completely neglectful. She walked in and said I have been seen at the clinic before and she couldn't help me. She asked which ER I wanted to go to and she discharged me. The entire point of me going to a walkin clinic was to avoid the hassle of the hospital. I left and went to a clinic a few miles down the road. This doctor took a simple X-ray of my abdomen and spotted the stone in my ureter that is causing me so much pain and discomfort.

The physician who saw me to review my blood test results (for $50) basically told me to take fish oil and would not even consider a refill on the prescription the first physician had given, much less any other medication and/or treatment for my ailments. All in all, then, I have to say I was/am dissatisfied. (Also, their feedback form does not come up when clicked on, soooo you cannot provide feedback directly to AFC!)", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479224917853, "text": "We appreciate your feedback, and welcome the opportunity to address all concerns.

However, she no longer owns TFM and it seems like the greedy corporation take over has ruin what was once a great doctor's office.\n\nI showed to an appointment recently that was badly needed, as I had some concerns about me health including new issues. I had no prior contact with the office in any way before my appointment or was told nothing at previous visits. But money is what they wanted. I had no idea I had a bill, but the first thing they told me was \"you can't be seen today\" and then go on to tell me about the bill, which I offered to pay on, but I didn't have my cc with me at the time and offered to pay when I came back in a few days to get blood work results.\n\nThey gave their spiel about how doctors need to get paid too, and would I work without expecting to get paid, and blah blah blah. I' believe people deserve to get paid for good services. After all, I had been coming there for over 10 years and paid ever single bill prior, so why would anyone think I wouldn't pay this one. I've my own business before, I know it's important to get paid.  But shouldn't human decency and kindness be the first form of communication one starts with instead of the \"I want my money first\" attitude?\n\nFor me, I felt abandon by a doctor's office that I had been coming to for years. That I trusted my children with. I was given zero notice before being told I couldn't be seen. I was over due for certain treatments that I have to see the doctor or nurse to receive. I had concerns about my blood pressure and other issues that were important to prevent increased medical problems. I didn't want to hear their spew about \"working for free\" or we have to be paid to continue services, I wanted to hear. \"Ok, what can we do to help you out? We're here for you.\" Treat people like this first I guarantee you will always get paid.\n\nOr at the least I wanted the bare treatment until I had enough time to find another doctor for treatment, but I wasn't even given that. Yes, they offered to see me again, but made it clear I was going to have to jump through some hoops and pay, always with an emphasis on getting paid, never about what I thought doctors first priority was supposed to be: to do no harm an give their patients the best medical care they can ( not for free of course), but a good doctor put's people first. Dr. Burdette always did this, but this new corporation or whomever owns Taylorville Family Medicine now, IS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY AND COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT YOU.

Today I had an appointment scheduled with her that I had been waiting months for, my appointment was at 3:15pm at 3:00pm I received a text that said they were running behind and my new appointment time would be at 3:31pm and that they would text me again before my appointment to confirm. At 3:30pm I received the same text. I went ahead to the appointment because I needed to be seen and I would just wait in my car. When I went in and checked with the receptionist she told me that I was 45 minutes late and that they would have to reschedule my appointment. I showed her the texts and she said that they only sent the one text that was generated when I did not show up for my appointment at 3:15pm. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE!!!!  I was very upset, she told me that it would throw them completely behind to try and see me and that she talked to the owner and he said that I would have to reschedule. There was absolutely no one in the waiting room. While telling me this a woman walked in and said are you still open? She said yes and checked her in for bloodwork. But they can\u2019t admit their mistakes when it comes to texts that cause problems and let me be seen. They then sent one of the medical assistants out to talk to me. He was VERY RUDE AND CONDESCENDING, after telling me that I should have come and checked in at my appointment time he went on to tell me that he was always at least 15 minutes early for ever appointment he has ever scheduled. When I told him that was foolish for me to come and sit in a reception area for an undetermined amount of time in the middle of a pandemic-he told me I could have waited in my car. When I told him that I was working and felt that was ridiculous he told me that he was a single parent to 2 children whose mother had died and that he had to be both parents to his children and still keep his appointments and go to work everyday to support them. This all in a raised voice that apparently carried. When he finally stopped his tirade, or I could have possibly interrupted him to tell him that my husband passed away in 2012 and that I also have 2 children that I have had to raise myself while working and keeping appointments and yes I raised my voice too. At that point, the nursing staff came out and told me to leave and that the owner would call me. That I was upsetting the patients in the office. Really??? I have always been at my appointments, I have watched this office deteriorate over the last couple of years, I like Dr Burdette but it is clear from all the things that have happened and from the way they have treated me (and others if you read the google reviews and not all the five star reviews they have on there site which I am positive they solicit and approve) that Dr Burdette has absolutely no control over what happens with her patients. I am certain that the owner will never call me and if he does it will probably be to tell me not to come back. Which he doesn\u2019t need to do because I will not be treated like that and will find another doctor. One that actually cares about the needs of their patients and does not treat them like they treated me today. I am extremely disappointed in Dr Burdette, I feel like after 10 years she should have at the very least - have talked to me herself, but she did not, I feel very sad that she cared so little for me as her patient but I guess I just misjudged her as well. This is not the first problem I have had with them but it will be the last. The NP\u2019s there miss a lot of things and you almost never see Dr Burdette unless you specifically ask to and then things like this happen. I expect them to not release my records without a fight also. Please think before you make an appointment here and please don\u2019t put yourself in risk if you feel that you are not getting the care you need and deserve at this or any of their clinics. I will be reporting all of what happened to me today to my insurance company and to the state medical board.

After my current pediatrician, Dr. Rivas, advised it was time to transition to an adult provider. During the time he was my provider, Dr. Ginevan worked alongside my psychiatrist to continue maintenance of my ADHD and when necessary, he worked with specialists to manage my delicate GI condition. This included references to appropriate clinics and scheduling of applicable tests ie. Colonoscopy, EGD, etc. I truly trusted Dr. Ginevan and was incredibly grateful to have found such a wonderful physician. I never minded the fact that his office was always moving locations or that his appointments had become a nightmare to secure. I still referred only my closest of friends and family to see him. Always assuring them they'd be nothing less than satisfied with him as they're provider. Those were the old days... in 2013 I moved away to live on base with my then husband. I moved back in 2015 and returned to Dr. Ginevan. He and his staff had undergone a complete restructuring as they were now a part of the mega-merger trend and had merged with the tri-cities health giant Shoals Primary Care LLC. Due to the merger Dr. Ginevan no longer had any of my previous medical records from all of my time spent under his care which led to massive complications to my continuity of care. (I now understand the importance of my responsibility to secure medical history documentation and maintain my own current updated personal medical record.) Also, SADLY, due to the implementation of a governmental-esque standard of operating procedures, it is my opinion that Dr. Ginevan no longer maintained the level of patient care he had became known for. His office staff has always been grade-A; to be commended. If you are considering seeing Dr. Ginevan as your primary care provider this review is for you. In closing I want to say that this review in no way, intends to slander or cause malice.

I ignored that fact and still decided to give the doctor the benefit of the doubt because I could understand things sometimes happen. However, upon my scheduled visit as a first time patient it was for 7:30 am, and I arrived at 7:15 am for new patient paper work. I signed in and no one even showed up at the front desk until my appointment time, where I  then asked for my paper work and filled it out. About ten minutes after that, another woman called me by the wrong name and when I corrected her, I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong. Also, you can not hear when you are being called because the TV is loud, so people are talking over the TV, and I have two ear infections. After filling out my paper work, I was then called back to the window, where I was asked to write down my SSN, but I had already written it down twice on the form already. This told me they obviously were not paying attention to the information they were entering. After this, and already feeling on edge from just the front desk experience, I am called back by the doctor's nurse practitioner who tells me to step on the scale, and with a horrible tone says, \"you're going to have to take some of that off.\" Meaning my purse. I ask where I should put it in case of a designated area, which seem to make her even more annoyed and she replies with, \"I don't know.\" Very snappy. I am a new patient and felt like I was asking a very simple and non offensive question. We then walk to the exam room where she informs me that I would not be seeing the doctor and that he also would never been doing my exams or ever seeing me other than a quick peek in the room. Which, as someone looking for a long term doctor, it does not feel comfortable not even meeting my doctor on the first visit. When I tried to explain that I was uncomfortable with the fact she would only be relaying my issues to the doctor, and that I didn't feel comfortable having my health looked after in third person, and that I didnt understand why they wouldn't tell a new patient to begin with when making an appointment that he or she won't be seeing a doctor. She then got upset about it and told me I could reschedule or abort because she had been doing this for 40 years. Which is fine and I explained to her I was fine with her seeing me, but that I didn't feel comfortable having a doctor diagnose me without speaking with me and knowing me as a person. She gets more upset and I said I think it would be best just to cancel because at that point, being someone who has been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, I was overwhelmed and ready to go home. She proceeded to then say to me, \"Fine then. Adios.\" I feel as if the entire situation was unprofessional on many different levels. I decided to keep searching for a new doctor. I would not advise this practice if you want to get to know your doctor for long term use, or have anxiety issues, seeing as how it is the only doctor's office I have ever been in where the lobby is loud and over packed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

NEXT , I go in for my inr check and my levels are still below standard so he send me to Hellen Keller to do bloodwork and says he will call with the results. No call..... Instead I call up there later in the day and she says you need to come pick up you medicine. So I go get it they have switched my medicine with no telling me no nothing I am a breastfeeding mother. He switched me to a medicine that I cannot breastfeed on without any consultation. I had to Google the risks and side effects. Totally unprofessional and a headache. I will be switching doctors asap!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

I was finally taken back to be triaged and put in a room.  My daughter and granddaughter were still in waiting room for another 10 mins or so before they were taken back to be triaged and put into a room.\n\nOnce in a room, I waited for a little while and the NP came in and saw me.  She was great! She told me someone would be in to swab me for the flu and strep. Head hurting, lying on the bed...all I heard was talking and laughing coming from the nurses station.  Waited for what seemed like forever...still no one shows up to check on me.  I go to the restroom across the hall from my room and came back out to the nurses sitting at the station talking about Thanksgiving, shopping, etc. I then asked if my orders to be swabbed had been sent to them.  They all opened their laptops and said oh yes, here it is. \"Someone will be with you in a moment\".  Then a moment of silence from them and then the chattering back and forth began again.\n\nA couple of minutes later the nurse that came in was Kia, very sweet and kind.  I had not met or even saw her until she came into do the swab. She did apologize for the delay and said that she had previously been in with another patient. I laid my head back down and then texted by daughter a few minutes later and asked her if my granddaughter had been swabbed as well.  She said she had not been.  I then went back outside my door and asked if anyone had been in to swab by granddaughter and was told yes...without even giving them her name at first. My daughter heard them bold face lie to me.  I told them that I knew that no one had been in there to swab her and expected it to be done ASAP because she was very sick. A \"professional\" to lie to my face is repulsive.\n\nAgain Kia, was the nurse sent into the room to do the swab.  After the test came back on me, a totally different nurse came into the room and gave me my shots.  I never saw one of the ones sitting at the desk again.  That is where they stayed.  My granddaughter finally received her diagnosis as strep and was also given a shot.  The shot was given by Kia.\n\nWhere were all the other nurses that had nothing to do but sit around the desk and chit chat all morning?  For us being the only patients there during all of this time, it should not have taken 2 hours. I don't mind waiting at all if there is a good reason but this particular day and location, there was no reason for this to be a 2 hour visit.  This is what will happen you have a full staff on hand but only a couple of them are actually working.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1575311025373, "text": "Our manager would really like to speak with you more regarding this matter.

I could barely walk 9 out of 10 days. I had to request Xrays. Didn't even address my migraine compliant. No prescription for pain. On 2nd visit, states Xrays showed arthritis. Still no prescription for pain or suggestion for possible treatment (such as stem cell). Instead, focuses on high blood pressure... I can barely walk some days & you want to talk about my blood pressure & tell me to buy a blood pressure machine. Hasnt been high in yrs, including 1st visit 30days prior.. STILL doesnt address migraines & refers me to someone else. STILL nothing for either of the 2 pain related issues. Also fails to fill out my medical papers for work correctly & needed them corrected bc my job doesn't accept Dr. excuses. What he did fill out, he didn't sign so they were useless. I called literally about 45 times, during business hrs, and only got someone 5 times, (which their only open til 430pm, M-Thurs, take an hr & half lunch & are not conveniently located). Of the 5 times someone answered & said I'd get a call back, I got 1. I have the call logs to prove it. Yet, if I immediately call from a different phone, someone will answer. Obviously they screen calls. Fiinally gave up since Dr. refused to correct paperwork as I needed it. A waste of time & money. This office is a joke.

I was told by one of the office personnel that \"for insurance plans with high deductibles we charge $100.\" In my insurance booklet from BCBS it says my Co pay for an urgent care center is $50. After telling her that we have a $300 per person deductible, she told me I was wrong and that my deductible was $7800 or $7900 which isn't true. If I could post photos of our State Employee Insurance Board book from BCBS Alabama it plainly states that we each have a $300 per person deductible per calendar year, I would. We have a $7800 Maximum out of pocket cost for one person and $14500 for a family, but she clearly stated deductible. I'm going to assume they were talking about our maximum out of pocket costs instead of deductible, but even then, that shouldn't be something that urgent care centers even consider.\n\nI went to Eastern Shore Urgent Care Center in November or December and they didn't bill me $100 for seeing the doctor. I paid a $50 copay. I am going to go back to that one even though it is out of my way. Always be sure to look at your insurance booklet and read it every year for updates. There are some doctors offices and urgent care centers that will try to charge you more.\n\nEdit: I went to Eastern Shore Urgent Care center and my co pay was $35. I called and confirmed with BCBS that my deductible isn't in the $7000s. I'm not sure if she misread my insurance or what happened, but I shouldn't have to pay extra for services that my insurance MIGHT not cover. They are basically saying that they are going to charge you extra because you may not pay your bill for services rendered so we will have an account. I would rather go to an urgent care center where I'm billed a Co pay and then sent a bill for extra services that my insurance didn't cover.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1549662264015, "text": "Kelsey Herring, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.

If you don't want to do your job, stay home and let someone who WANTS to work do it for you.  Also, if you have no idea about customer service or how to speak to someone who has a legitimate issue, maybe, just maybe, you should take a class on professionalism and not just rely on the fact that you got the job because someone vouched for you.

The test used (Abbott ID Now) has a near zero false positive rate when a qualified technician runs the test. The AFC clinician I saw also told me that there was no way it was a false positive. However, I was told by a clinician at one of my follow up tests that the only way to get a false positive on the Abbott now protocol is if the sample is contaminated or if samples are mixed up. From this, I concluded that the AFC clinician/technician made a mistake, one that was quite costly for me both financially (I spent $450 in follow up testing) and emotionally (I feared I had exposed my elderly parents). I would recommend using a different clinic for a rapid test.\n\nI was also disappointed in their safety protocols vis-a-vis Covid.

I am an active duty service member. Our family is insured with Tricare Prime which covers 100%. My wife goes to this clinic because the location is convenient and the clinicians are great. Two weeks ago we received a letter from American Family Care stating that the amount of $54.66 has been sent to collection. I was shocked. Called the clinic and they give me the number for billing the department. Call the billing department and one of the lady who happened to be super rude picked up the phone after I waited 45 min told me that the amount of $54.66 we owned is the deductible. I tried to explain to her that with Tricare Prime there is no out of pocket cost at all. She told me to call Tricare and ask one of the Tricare representative to give her a call. Called Tricare, the representative from Tricare said that they are a receiving call center only, they don't make call out to other people. Asked Tricare about that $54.66, they explained to me that the billing department from AFC mess up the claim. Instead of filling the claim under my regular PCM, they filed it under another physician who wasn't a primary care physician at that time. That's why Tricare didn't process the entire claim amount. Instead of reprocess the claim, no one from AFC ever go back to take a look at the claim but instead decide to bill me the remaining amount. Tricare advise me to call AFC and make a conference call while everyone is on the line so Tricare rep can walk someone from AFC billing department through how to reprocess the claim to resolve the problem. Called back to AFC billing department and talk to someone name David. I explained the entire process to him again and he said he will make some note and transfer the case over to someone who can resolve the problem and I should expect a call back either later that day or the day after. Guess what, today is 2 weeks later and still haven't heard anything from them. Tried to call the \"patient advocate\" number from whoever gave the number to Carol Peppers on the comment below and just as I expected \"the number you have called can no longer received voice mail\".

I have been to pediatricians who literally said, \"No that's not the issue.\" Dr. Laubenthal will say, \"I don't think that is it, but you are the mom and God gave you instincts so let's look into it,\" or \"This is why it can't be that\" and gives me lab data or proof that I am incorrect in my thoughts.\n\nI genuinely trust him to assess, diagnose, and treat my family and me.

I now experience zero symptoms.\n\nLacey Quarles successfully diagnosed me with pulmonary emboli when it was thought I had pneumonia. I was hospitalized shortly after and told it was caught \"just in time.\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a805bb4b02ff:0xcb6978f03918ab47"}

Upon making an appointment this week, I hoped that things would be different. They were.....somewhat. I made an appointment for 8:00 in the morning and arrived at 7:40 or so to fill out any necessary paperwork. The front desk staff was friendly and courteous. About 8:05 I was called to the back and thought, \"this is going great so far\".  I was then informed that Dr. Davidson normally doesn't arrive until 8:45-9:00 or so. What in the ever-loving hell!!? Why would anyone make appointments beginning an hour before the doctor arrives? I'm not sure if this is an issue with the scheduling staff or the doctor himself but I find it highly unacceptable. Time is valuable for anyone. They sure wouldn't wait for a patient to be an hour late for the appointment, why should I wait for him? I want to stress that even while listening to my short rant about how F'ed up the situation was, the staff remained friendly and courteous.

Neither of us could ever get a receipt (after we would beg) that matched any of our insurance bills. That may be because they listed us as missing appointments (we have never missed an appointment) or as not even having them!  I had a list of my past two years of appointments and they didn\u2019t have but two of them on their books. Also, one cannot get a response on their portal in five or six days, sometimes not at all. You can\u2019t get them by phone at all so you have to go through the portal for all things. Not a problem unless the staff is as non-responsive as they seem to be.

So frustrating, I may as well have been talking to a robot. You have to pay $60 dollars a year for an online service (that you don\u2019t have to use, because you can still just call if you prefer) and if you opt out of the unnecessary online service then they charge you $10 for every piece of mail they would send you. Ridiculous and unnecessary. I suspect they have too many clients because they don\u2019t do a good job of making new clients feel welcome and taken care of. The CRNP I saw was good, but there are too many layers of unnecessary headache between the client and her. I chose this place because it came highly recommended to me by family, but apparently that was years ago before the new onboarding and client management process, and when I asked why this new process was so terrible, she said it didn\u2019t use to be that way. I was told that my family member was probably \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in to the old system. If the new client management system was truly better, easier, more intuitive, and actually added value for older customers, then why would they not institute it with all their clients?

We are always working for continual improvement at Innova and it is encouraging to hear that you share our frustration with the widespread dependence on unreliable communication methods like fax machines and telephone calls to transfer critical patient information between medical facilities in our community. We strive to avoid paper orders and utilizing faxes, but because so few clinics and hospital facilities locally utilize modern communication methods, we are still forced to send 86% of our communications with other clinics by \"electronic fax.\" This just means that we don't use paper to send the fax, but it's still a picture of a document sent over a phone line as opposed to electronic communication with structured data in a standardized format that increases accuracy and safety.

The have automated a lot of their administrative processes and use technology to their advantage (e.g. having a patient web portal where you can communicate with them, see test results, schedule appointments, etc). The result is that it frees the providers up to focus on the patient rather than paperwork. And their appointment times run like clockwork. Like a 9am appointment is really 9am, and if they are 10 minutes late, they are apologizing profusely.\n\nEvery provider I have dealt with at Innova also gets an \"A\" for bedside manner. Sometimes medical issues aren't easy to discuss, even with medical professionals. However, Innova providers really have a warm interpersonal, friendly demeanor that takes that edge off.\n\nThey also focus on general wellness and health as much as medicine, that is they don't just throw pills at you. They actually have a full time dietician/nutritionist and a wellness program you can enroll in. So if you are looking to lose weight or just not be a generally average unhealthy Alabamian, it's better to do it under medical supervision from people who know what they are doing.\n\nAlso, they take my insurance (Aetna), and their rates/discounts are reasonable, so that's nice too.

These are my reasons behind that. I don\u2019t like coming into a doctor\u2019s office and not be greeted by a friendly face. Instead you\u2019re greeted by a keyosk (however you spell it) walking you through steps to sign in and pay. Next when you are seen, the visits are rushed and I feel that I\u2019m just a number patient on the list,  instead of a person who they are taking their time with to answer any questions or concerns I may have. I have left several times knowing that I did not get the opportunity to address all of my concerns. While I know this is a business, and money has to be exchanged for services, If you are behind on a payment of $10 or whatever, I don\u2019t appreciate being called by a \u201cmafia like\u201d voice message indicating I have 24 hours to pay you, and that I cannot be seen until that is resolved. Lastly, my father was recently scheduled for a procedure. However,  his blood pressure was too high. Stroke level to be exact. Innova was called and they refused to see him at their office even when the nurse where he was called them, hoping that would make a difference.  They claimed there is a balance on his account, which there isn\u2019t. This is very poor judgement on a so called health care professional. Copies of the canceled checks have been shown indicating he was up to date, but they just dropped him as a patient.  I along with the rest family have \u201cDROPPED \u201c Innova as our primary health care facility. Anyone looking for a general practitioner, should never go here. Thanks.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532654563903, "text": "Diedre, We hope you are able to establish with a new provider with which you have a trusting provider-patient relationship. While we cannot discuss patient cases on a public form as you have brought up, I have certainly enjoyed talking to your father myself several times over the past few weeks and was happy to take care of his medical needs. We look forward to seeing him again soon. Medical billing can be a frustrating and confusing issue especially in this time of increasing deductibles.  We deal with this on behalf of our patients frequently and are happy to discuss these questions or concerns with our patients to get them resolved.\n\nOur current practices at Innova include being open on Saturdays for sick visits and for those who work during the week as a convenience to them.  We do not fully staff the office on Saturdays so you will not see one of my team sitting at the guest reception desk in the lobby. My team needs their weekends too! Otherwise, Christine or one of my other team members is at the guest reception desk to greet you.  I regret you have not felt heard at your office visits.  This is one of our highest priorities at Innova.  We sometimes find that we cannot adequately address all of a patient\u2019s concerns within one office visit and in those instances we will ask you to continue to follow up with us until all has been addressed. Lastly, our billing company will begin calling patients after three statements have been sent out without payment to collect that payment for medical services already rendered. We are always willing to set up a payment plan for any amount. Unfortunately some patients do expect to be able to remain current patients and receive medical services without payment thus we use resources such as the AMA and the AAFP Practice Management recommendations to assist us with how best to address these issues.\n\nAgain, we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862132e04d8184d:0xb0d4fc8e9fba4586"}

I didn't get the message, as I never dreamed they wouldn't be in direct contact with me. So, nearly a week later, I get a same day appointment at Innova.  I walk in with a cane. They proceed to tell me they cannot do anything for me. I barely made it there and it's late in the day. I insist there must be sonething to do since I couldn't perform basic hygiene or walk.  So they sent in another and another staff member, as I explained myself over and over I became more agitated and more explicit about what I couldn't do as a result of the blindibg pain. They finally arranged a MRI that afternoon at close of day. I went.\nI hear back next day that my hip is shot and that I need  hip replacement.The orthopaedic surgeon said the year plus old xrays were clearly indicative of hip replacement some time ago  One heels of this news,  then I find Innova has deemed me innapropriate to be their patient. They sent person after person to witness my behavior and to justify their getting rid of me, not as I thought, to find someone on their staff who understood me.\nSo, If you are in excruciating pain, or have pressing health issues for a primary care doctor to manage, I would not recommend Innova. They had been my doctor for months at the time of the incident. They had not consulted with specialists who were caring for me. Then at my most vulnerable, they threw me out. I'm  certain I would have been better off at the ER with some random tramua doctor than to go there and be treated / not treated as I was by them.\nThey rely on their portal, messaging, voicemails emails and texts. A bit hands off for me anyway, that was a contributor to my missed communication and frustration, and prolonged pain.

When Dr. Uptagrafft asked if I had anything I would like her to check out, she didn't hesitate to check into it. She ran tests and did an ultrasound and, sure enough my thyroid was enlarged and, my levels were off. I eventually had to have my thyroid removed. I've heard many people have gone years with undiagnosed thyroid issues because, their doctors were so quick to dismiss the issue as something else without testing the levels or doing an ultrasound to rule it out. At innova they listen to your concerns and, they do what they can to get to the bottom of any issues you may have.

The wait times (in the waiting room and waiting around in the exam room for the doctor and nurse) were as if there were 15 or so patients. I believe there were one or two nurses working, but a woman (albeit a very nice and helpful woman who did her job, or rather someone else's job, well) who's badge said Radiology Tech performed all nurse duties other than blood draw and throat swab. I spent most of the visit wishing I had gone / thinking about going somewhere else. I grew up in Vestavia, and this was one of many poor experiences I've had at that location over the years. About 10 years ago I had a nurse insert the blood draw needle upside down! Meaning, she put it in to where the tip of the needle was pointing towards my wrist. Absurd. I was right near it and looking for a urgent care when I went in this week. It didn't take me long to remember why I stopped going there. Also, I've read multiple negative reviews about Dr. Brentnall, and I'm here to add another. I was there with a cold and an unrelated YI. He asked me, \"Well, about that, we can't still get in to see our lady doctor, right?\" It was very dismissive, rude, and awkward. He really didn't pay any attention to what I had to say. He ordered a step test when I had clearly explained I knew the only reason my throat hurt was sinus drainage. The only thing he did listen to was my self-diagnoses. After much wasted time and unnecessary labs, he came in with a prescription for an upper respiratory infection and a YI - exactly what I told him I thought I had.  Overall, he made me uncomfortable and wishing I'd seen any doctor but him. Spare yourself, don't go to this office!

This was a truly baffling experience, and you should only come here if you want you symptoms ignored or to be immediately referred to an allergy specialist for cold / strep throat symptoms.\n\nHere's a quick list of things that Dr. Brentnall did or said to prevent me from ever coming back here again. I came in after my cold symptoms worsened for 5 days with no sign of improvement plus I had developed a bad sore throat and dizziness:\n\n- He treated me like a child. He grabs the instrument to look in my mouth, ears, and nose. He stares at me for a second then says, \"I can see better if you open your mouth.\" Are you serious?? How about you ask me to open my mouth? For all I know you're going for my nose!\n- \"your nose is red. Looks like you're bothered by the ragweed\". Proceeds to talk about an allergist he recommends and a medication etc. I have had allergies since I was 13, and they are under control. I know what allergies are, and this is not allergies. How about my nose is red because I've had COLD SYMPTOMS FOR 5 DAYS!?\n- He never asks about my symptoms. I had to force them on him by blurting them out when he walks in for the 4th or 5th time he's come in the room (usually to talk about allergies some more). He dismissed them all as either being allergies, my IBS (which is also under control), or a side effect of medication I've been taking for 6 YEARS! I have never had a negative reaction to this medication. I know it can start at any time, but what are the odds of all of these things happening at once rather than I actually have a bad cold, or the flu, or something else?!\n- He sat on the bed with me twice.... I was very uncomfortable. He should have grabbed a chair since there were practically no other patients in the entire office.\n- I cannot count the number of times he talked about allergies or particles in the air.\n- He tried to trick me into taking allergy medication. He vaguely described what it was when he listed the meds, and never said it was for allergies. I only found out when the pharmacist mentioned it. I already take a daily OTC allergy medication. I DO NOT HAVE AN ALLERGY PROBLEM!\n\nI'm really curious to know if he treats all of his patients this way or if it is just the female patients. Also, does he get some kind of kick back from the number of people he refers to this allergist?? My boyfriend and I left that place completely furious. Every time Dr. Brentnall left the room, we would rant to each other. I believe the staff could hear us through the door each time, and I really hope they did.\n\nI will say the only positive was the pharmacist. She was knowledgeable yet eager to learn when I told her I needed gluten free medications due to celiac. And there was no way I was going to get that allergy medication filled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889220ea1374f87:0xf88c51cd3ebb99d0"}

The pain finally got so bad that it is shooting up his leg and he is having trouble walking so he decided he had to go. The appointment was a little over $180. The nurses didn't know how to use the computer system. They asked him the same questions and what his name was over and over. One of the nurses smelled so badly of body odor that I could smell her as I was following her down the hall. My friend was gagging while she attempted to take his blood pressure. It took several tries. Finally, we got into a room. The doctor (Caroline Feist) came in and asked what the problem was. She seemed skeptical like she did not believe him. I'm sure she sees many people seeking pain meds and is therefore skeptical, but he never asked for pain pills. He described the problem and how it was affecting his job and how it developed. She touched the area of his foot, lightly, with two fingers (no thorough exam) and sent him to get x-rays. Once the x-rays came back, she told him they didn't show anything and that there were many reasons he could be in pain (she didn't say what any of these reasons were). He asked what he should do: sturdy shoes, orthotics, compression, ice? She said to do whatever he would like to do, wrote him a prescription for anti-inflammatories, and said to go see his primary care physician. He can't afford another doctor visit. Now he has lost a day's wages plus $180 for nothing and will not be able to pay his bills. Dr. Feist demonstrated a lack of empathy and professionalism and strong skepticism throughout the visit.

People shouldn\u2019t make it a habit to ask to lay down somewhere is my point.)I was checked on periodically and offered some water. The nurses and doctor were all very kind and thorough.

She went to get the doctor, but not before finishing her text. She took too long, so I rushed my mother to the back myself.\n\nAt this point, I was surprised that she was even conscious, but we made it to the doctor whom I begged for help... and was completely and utterly unwilling to help due to the fact that they had not finished processing our paperwork.\n\nI was convinced that my mother was going to die, so I gave her mouth-to-mouth\u200b in hopes that it will give her enough air to dispurse the mucus. She was able to cough up enough to allow small short breaths of air, and I begged again for them to help her. They still refused, and suggested that I take her to the hospital. There was a chance that my mother would not make it to the ER, and would suffocate before reaching the ER, but the doctors here would rather let a woman die in front of them instead of bend the rules of their job once.\n\nI was able to get my mother to Shelby Hospital before she suffocated, and she was given an inhaled medicine that the hospital physician told me that an Urgent Care Center like American Family Care should have already had.\n\nBottom line is that if you care about your safety and the safety of your loved ones, go someplace else.

However, I have been seriously disappointed the last few times I've been to this facility. First and foremost, the Friday before Easter, I was ill and needed to come in for antibiotics. My fiance and I arrived at 7:15 only to find them closed. AFC used to be quick- in and out in an hour. As I write this I've been sitting here for an hour in the lobby. Haven't even been called back to triage or a room yet. Not to mention, when I checked in and paid my copay the receptionist tried to discourage me from being seen. \"If you get tired of waiting, we will refund your money.\" I asked if there was a long wait, she stated that the doctor was only seeing seven patients at a time and that there were seven in the back already and \"five thousand\" in the lobby. After this, I watched the same receptionist pseudo turn away three more people, discouraging them to check in because of the \"long wait\". All three left, one a teenage girl with her mother, limping and in tears. If people come here, they obviously have a reason. This is a facility that is designated to help ill and injured people, and if that impedes your off time, then so be it. Most people in the working world have to stay late from time to time. Good workers still do their job. Also, the doctor may only be seeing 7 patients at a time, but there are more than 7 rooms in the facility. Instead of having people that are already unwell sit in the uncomfortable lobby chairs for hours at a time, they could move people to the vacant rooms so they could be more comfortable. Even still, this location always seems to be this busy so why on earth is there only one doctor on staff? Makes no sense. The last few times I have been in this facility for either me or my fiance, we have had to wait for at least two hours. There was one occasion that we didn't get out until almost 10pm, at which point I would have had to drive 25 minutes to get to a pharmacy that would be open and able to fill my scripts. I've been to Shelby ER and have been taken to a room faster than this. More to follow....\n\nUpdate: 1.5 hours. Still in the waiting room. Still with two patients in front of me.\n\nBack in a room. Angelise triaged me. She's a doll. Best part of this experience so far. She has great communication skills and was still upbeat even with it being 8:45 by the time I was triaged.\n\nTook me another hour to see the doctor, Dr. Habert. I could tell what the holdup was when he spent a lot of time chatting with us in the room. I didn't mind that so much. Its better than seing a doctor for less than a minute when you wait for hours. What I did mind was being told that my diagnosis, walking pneumonia, was a result of dairy products. Now, to be clear, I didn't have an issue with this and I heard him out at the time, but by the time I got home, I researched it, and couldn't find any correlation or any research to support his statements... He was very nice and had a great bedside manner. But maybe we shouldn't be misinforming patients?

My grandmother had fell causing her lip to bust open and was in need of stitches, so this medical facility was the closest and hopefully cheapest choice, But on arrival i was treated with such disrespect. I checked her in and give the nurses my grandmothers information and helped her back, but i wasn't allowed any further, so I go to wait in the lobby and waited for an hour. I go to ask how my grandmother is doing but the nurses acted like they didnt know what i was talking about so i ask how much longer was it going to be and they ignored me so i go back to sit and waited for another hour. I go up to ask about my grandmother again only to be given the same response as before, I get frustrated so i go out to check on my car, and as i was trying to come back to the lobby the doors were locked. I was locked out in the cold and had no idea what condition my grandmother was in so I knocked on the door until a nurse noticed and she just stood there staring at me. I wave her over but she ignored me and went back behind her desk.I dont know why i was treated like this but i can only come up with that my skin color wasn't white (all the nurses were white). It was 15 degrees out so i went back and waited in my car. A few minutes go by i see a cop car come by and he parks in front of the building like he got a call, and then i see him looking around the whole building for somebody (im guessing me). But i stay in my vehicle until he leaves. After all that i see my grandmother finally come out after 4 hours of waiting. Again i illiterate: i dont know why they treated me like a second class citizen but i guess its cause im not white.\n\nIn summary: This medical facility locked me out and called the police on me for my skin color.

I had what most would call a toothache. I, however,  called it the forces of nature trying to rip out my insides through a small opening in my exposed gum.  Anyway, I am also a Medicare patient who cannot just up and make an appointment with a dentist or oral surgeon like everyone else.  I have to get any dental procedures approved through Medicare, which by the way doesn't happen the same day (usually a 72 hour turn around, even then you are not guaranteed approval).  I had an infection and had eaten an entire bottle of 20 Alleve in about 48 hours.  I entered the facility expecting just average level of concern and kindness.  What I encountered when I got there was anything but that!  The front office staff was so nice and professional!  However, the best was yet to come!  The nurse who called me back and took my vitals was just such a lovely young woman. The EPITOME of professional, kind and sympathetic that one would look for while in pain visiting ANY doctor's office, but often never receiving.   Then, Dr. Pike entered the room.  I have seen Dr. Pike before while I was sick, and he was always professional.  Maybe, I am being swayed by the amount of discomfort I was in, but this doctor acted as if he were a concerned family member!!    I was SO IMPRESSED WITH MY VISIT FROM THE SECOND I ENTERED THE BUILDING UNTIL I LEFT!  I do have a PCP who practices several cities away.

So I was being given two shots as treatment YET NO LABS HAD BEEN DONE. SO what exactly what she treating me for? Strange to recieve shots before labs....and then she never even came back in the room...the medical assistant walked in and mumbled something about take your meds and went to leave. I had to stop him and ask him what medications I was given and what my test results were. He then had to go and ask the NP and try to get an answer and came back and mumbled ok follow me...next thing i knew i was being pushed out the door and i had no idea what meds i was given or where to pick them up. I stopped him and he had to go back and ask the NP AGAIN....all of this could have been prevented had she seen me and given me the results to begin with like a dr should. he comes back 20 min later and tells me that my meds got sent to calera and they got them changed to alabaster. only thing i was given was a Zpack. i was miserable for several days and could not sleep so i finally went to another urgent care and recieved the care i needed. I was also told I had a raging UTI and that zpac would not touch it....so they gave me Bactrim....so the NP ran all these tests on me and even my urine but didnt follow through.  I will not be back.

I tried to continue to use AFC alabaster but after this experience...i WILL NOT. and I will be putting this review on google.\n\nDecided to give them one more shot....went to visit last week because I was extremely sick....i mean EXTREMELY......imagine my surprise when the same NP came in ...and provided the SAME horrible service...talked down to me like I was an idiot....same responses as my last visit.....same meds....no blood drawn....left me in the room for over 2 hours for two simple tests and then nothing.....just came back in, gave me a shot, and pushed me out the door. I am done with this place. I will never be back and it looks like that is the same for alot of people because there was no one in the waiting room...never saw another patient while i was there...

Normally, if I end up leaving a review it is because I have experienced a dissatisfaction on numerous of occasions. Which, in this instance, is accurate yet again. Main Street is considerably close to my home and therefore mine and my families first stop. However, over the passed several months I have been very ill on-and-off. After being sick for nearly a week, I finally decided to make a trip to just try to get better. I was tested for both the strep and flu. However, both came back negative. This is a typical situation result when I come here. The last several visits I have been diagnosed with a \u201csinus infection\u201d, upper respiratory infection etc. When their PA told me last night I was negative again for flu and strep, with full knowledge knowing I 100% have both, I got incredibly frustrated. I told their PA, after she said it was probably just a sinus infection, that every time I come here that is what they diagnose me with. I have had to pay multiple doctors bills because of their misdiagnoses and having to seek out another doctor to properly diagnose me. To which each time, when I get tested elsewhere, it comes back positive. They said they gave me a \u201cshot\u201d to help speed the pain in my throat, and it is 5:30 in the morning and the pain in my throat is so severe there is ringing in my ear now which has woken me up in even more pain. So, once again I will have to pay ANOTHER doctor to diagnose me with what I know I have. This is incredibly exhausting. I don\u2019t know if it is malfunctioning testing machines or the lack of actual experienced doctors, but the fact that I have been awaken in such severe pain and body aches let\u2019s me know I once again did not receive the treatment I needed. With all of that said, the PA who was there did call me in a prescription for both the flu and strep after I complained I was tired of their diagnosis's continuously being that of a \u201csinus infection\u201d. I know if I let a good 48-72 hours of these medication stay in my system I will get better.

I also had a severe headache which I assumed was associated with the dehydration and flu. I am quite sure the nurse practitioner could hear the rattling in my back whenever she listen to me breathe, however, she did not order an x-ray to see if I had pneumonia or walking pneumonia. I have been running 102 to 103 fever for the fourth day as well. The fever had gone down when I went in because I had just taken Tylenol before going. She gave me a prescription for some little pill for my throat and a pill for nausea.  She did nothing for my dehydration. I should\u2019ve had an x-ray to see if I have pneumonia so that I could\u2019ve been given an antibiotic. I feel like it was a complete waste of my time and money. I had to sit and wait a long time very sick in a waiting room full of sick people basically be told nothing more than I already knew and left there was nothing to make me feel better. I told her that I did not want to leave there under those conditions; however, that is what happened. Now, tomorrow I am probably going to have to go to another urgent care or emergency room to get the care and attention I need.  The receptionist was continuously sending people away telling everyone that came in after I was there that it was just too long of a wait so everybody would leave and say they would come back later. Possibly, they might\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the amount of people they had, however, when I got there I asked how long the wait would be and she told me there was only four people ahead of me. I cannot explain their service, but I really go to a doctor and have never been to an urgent care, but this was certainly not a good experience for me. I am a 63 year old female and you should never play around with the health of anyone much less someone who is older.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1515103887932, "text": "Patricia, I am so sorry you did not have a great experience with our clinic.

As a former RN, Legal Nurse Consultant, Nurse Investigator and Forensic Criminal Evidence Analyst, I\u2019ve dealt with many physicians and their staff. I arrived in extreme pain from a pulled muscle in my back. I have been covered by UHC since 6/23/18. My cards won\u2019t arrive until Monday. I explained this to the young man at the desk (Luis??) and the young blonde lady who came to \u201chelp\u201d later. I had my membership and group ID in hand and even called United Health Care 5 times in front of them and on speaker for verification. UHC gave them the number to verify the insurance, only they couldn\u2019t complete the process because they had no idea what their OWN tax ID number was! They needed this to complete verification through the automated process. After much frustration, I called UHC customer service back and the kind lady spoke with the man at the front desk DIRECTLY. They insisted they HAD to have the physical card. She explained they only needed verification and there was no more information on the card than what we had already provided (my Member ID number, the group number, and my Drivers license.) However, they DID need their own tax ID to complete the automated process which neither of them knew and neither bothered to investigate further (perhaps asking the doctor?!) Frustrated by their ignorance, she finally suggested I go elsewhere for medical  attention and mentioned for all to hear she had NEVER heard of anyone needing the physical card when they were clearly verifying coverage for me. I will NOT return and rest assured this will be all over my social media accounts as well. I did not appreciate their lack of caring or basic knowledge.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1531758427687, "text": "Maggie, I am sorry that your visit was not satisfactory.

Since it was after hours, and I did not want to wait hours in the emergency room, I decided to go to the Urgent Care Twilight on Opelika Rd. Upon checking into the location, the receptionist and staff were very short to answer any questions I was having. On top of that, their bedside manner was terrible. I could not even walk on my own because of the swelling and pain, to the point where I was leaning on a friend. Seeing us struggling, they did not have the decency to offer to help my friend who was trying to support me. They actually made me stand at the counter and fill out paperwork, instead of letting me sit down to finish filling everything out in the EMPTY waiting room. The staff did not offer any wheelchairs/crutches/anything to steady myself, forcing me to walk from the check in, to triage, then to a room.  Once I was FINALLY sitting on an exam table, they had taken X-rays and arrived back shortly saying it was \"just a sprain\" and it \"should be fine in two weeks.\" Then they wrapped my ankle in an ACE bandage, charged me $150 (w insurance), and STILL did not offer any assistance in my mobility. On top of all of that? Months later, it is still swollen and I am still having difficulty with my ankle. I went to go see another doctor, and turns out, my ankle was fractured, not sprained.

Because of their error, I was billed $200 extra. After long waits on the phone with BCBS, I found out the story above.\n\nAt 9:30 am today I called Stopwatch to ask about how we could have been charged if we confirmed at the front desk that we were covered. They told me they would contact billing and return my call. When I didn't hear back from them in 30 min, I stopped by the office to ask in person about the error. After waiting for 20 minutes in the waiting room, I ended up calling the billing office myself and actually having to pass my phone to the receptionist to get their error fixed. After all that, they admitted fault and adjusted my bill.\n\nMy kid was sick when I went in to talk about billing, so I thought I might as well have him seen now that the billing issue was worked out.\n\nWe waited a reasonable 20 min, they did a flu test, and released us with an RX called in to CVS.\n\nI had to call twice, but they finally said they were resenting my RX. I assumed it'd be ready in an hour.\n\nWrong again. After trusting them to call in my prescription twice now, I went to Walgreens around 12:30, only to have them tell me that it hadn't been called in. So I had to call the office a FOURTH time now, and get them to actually call my prescription in.\n\nStopwatch forgot to cancel the RX at CVS, so I had to call CVS for them and ask them to cancel that prescription so that my finally called in RX could be filled at Walgreens. I got my kid's medicine at 1:30, after sitting in Walgreens for an hour for a prescription that was supposed to be called in and picked up. My sick kid fell asleep sitting up because of how long we had to wait.\n\nDragging my sick kid all over town and having to wait multiple hours because of Stopwatch's errors makes me positive that I'll never use this Urgent Care again.

The nurse was very nice and thorough. Then I met the doctor. I didn't catch his name, as he didn't introduce himself.

These two things had absolutely nothing to do with why I was here and it left me feeling embarrassed and ashamed. My primary care doctor is who I would talk to about those things, not an Urgent Care doctor. I would understand if it had anything to do with why I was there, but it had nothing to do with it.

After sitting a long time, dr came in asked what my symptoms were. Told him. He then looked in ears, nose, throat, listened to lungs. Said I have a viral infection, then asked if I had swab test done. Said yes. He left to check results, came back said they were fine. If I wanted him to prescribe medicine for cold, otherwise over the counter medicine would work. He left room. Tech came back in with a script for Alahist, information on upper respiratory illness with wheezing, walked me to check out. I checked out at 3:15. 2 hours!!! For a 17 minute test, 5 minutes with doctor. Terrible since my husband was sitting in lobby and saw people come in & leave before I came out. The script was useless since pharmacies don't carry that medicine. It would have to be ordered, available on Monday! Pharmacist said to get 3 over the counter medicines that contain what Alahist has in it and take that. Problem is they all have different duration times. Spent night up coughing, no rest. Today I'm still coughing, low grade fever, sore throat, green mucus now. Ribs hurt from the deep coughing, added Tylenol for fever also. 1:45 minutes of being ignored.

If you're sick, don't bother going here. I went in at about 11:00 and I was the only patient in the lobby. I signed in and paid my $20 copay the woman at the desk insisted I had to pay, even though my insurance card (which I handed her to look at) says \"copay $0\"). I am brought back pretty quickly by a nurse who takes my vitals and I have a low grade fever. I get seated and the doctor comes in decently quick, but she is cold and seems to be standoffish. I tell her my symptoms and she looks at my ears, throat, and listens to my breathing. She quickly orders the flu test and walks out. The nurse student says that the test will take about 15 minutes and she swabs my nose. I wait for a total of 48 minutes until some other nurse walks in, hands me a paper that says Influenza Type A on it and tells me to read it. She then walks right back out without seeing if I had questions (which I did!). While I waited, I could hear the nurses and doctors sitting there talking about their lunch plans and weekend plans, not doing their jobs. Also, after about 20 minutes of sitting in the room, I hear the nurses start talking about how my flu test was positive, and they were being super loud about it. That is a HIPPA violation! I then wait another 15 minutes for the student nurse to walk back in and give me my perscriptions and school excuse. Not once did anyone bother to come in and tell me I had the flu and bronchitis or to see if I had any questions. On top of it all, I heard the doctors outside my door arguing about whether or not I could continue to take the Tamiflu with my iron pills, and they still never told me if I should or should not take the Tamiflu and my iron pills. These doctors couldn't even tell me if my medications would conflict or react with the perscriptions they gave me! Overall, my experience was unprofessional, excessively long, and completely rubbish.

I was quickly taken back as very few people were there.  Once in the back I was swabbed for strep.  When the doctor came, he stated I did not have strep.  He Check my ears, nose, and lungs and told me I had drainage that was making my throat hurt.  He never looked in my throat.  He gave me a steroid shot and a week of amoxicillin. Over the next days I got worse.  After visiting another doctor, it was determined  that I had a bacteria in my esophagus and needed to be treated with a different class of an antibiotic.  Here is my review:  after a $50 co-pay, the doctor spent less than 2 minutes with me, doing a very poor job of considering all the possibilities for my sore throats and just treating me like I had a sinus problem.  He never looked at the back of my throat to see that it was not inflamed and the problem with further down in my esophagus.  I will never go back.

You see, I came in Saturday for urgent care, and they told me is need to get a referral from my doctor in 72 hours, and my primary care doctor gave me a paper to bring to your front desk. I tried to take care of it over the phone, seeing as my PCP submitted the referral through the internet, but the front desk girl had \"no idea what to do here\" and kept putting me on hold to speak to someone named Erica. The first time was 20 minutes, then I hung up and called back, because this is something front desk ladies have been able to do at other medical offices. The second time, the front desk girl got snappy with me, explaining that there was a waiting room full of people waiting JUST for Erica. I explained to her that I'd had to receive COVID-19 testing this morning, and I didn't want to risk bringing the paper in, but this was a time sensitive issue, according to the paper this very office gave me. She told me I needed to stay home and wait on hold. I waited another 10 minutes on hold before I got in my car. I came in wearing a mask and explained to the front desk lady that I needed to give her the paper, which took all of like 20 seconds. I asked her if this could have been done over the phone, and she told me OF COURSE. I showed her where I was still on hold on my cell phone, making it over an hour on hold to get to Erica. So, I'd like to thank Erica and the sassy front desk lady for potentially helping to spread COVID-19, by putting me in a position where I either had to come in (despite potentially having COVID-19), or risk getting stuck with a bill I could not afford, due to their lack of time management.

Total time: 2 hours 30 minutes!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1513808598873, "text": "Hi Diane,\n\nWe're sorry your experience was not satisfactory! Our goal is to always get our patients in and out within an hour. We are reviewing your chart so we can follow up with staff to see why your visit took so long. Since we are still new there in Mobile, I'm sure they're working out some kinks to make everything go a bit quicker. We hope we will have another opportunity to help you and your family feel better fast!

I was skating at the skating rink (thinking I was alot younger than I actually am), fell extremely hard and landed on my finger.  I came to this urgent care at 8:40 p.m and the website and sign said they were open until 9:00. All of the lights and signs were turned off when I walked up to the door. Although the lady at the desk initially saw me I stood out there for several minutes. Finally she came out and said they saw their last patient at 8:30. I told her that I just needed someone to look at my finger to tell me if it was definitely broken and she said they couldn't do it. Honestly I just want her to read this so that she knows how much she let me down.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553612401447, "text": "Hi Michael,\n\nI am so sorry for your negative experience and we will certainly be following up with our staff and take appropriate disciplinary action.
