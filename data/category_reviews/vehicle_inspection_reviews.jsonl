I brought my BMW X5 there to have the water pump replaced. They replaced the water pump, but damaged other parts on my vehicle while doing the repair. I was quoted $360 labor to replace the water pump. I called to check on my vehicle later that evening, and Yvonne said that her technician was having a hard time installing the water pump and that they had to charge me an extra hour worth of labor. Who fault is that? I told them no way, so they only charged me the $360 that I was originally quoted. However they did mentioned that my car needed 2 more repairs and quoted me $563 for one and $440 for the other. The $440 repair was for a hose that was damaged while they were changing the pump. The hose cost $40 from the BMW dealership and they said it would be 4 hours of labor, which didn't sound right for a hose. I called 3 other independent shops and was quoted $130 for the same repair parts and labor. The $563 was for a hood latch and cable, the parts at dealer are $80. Yvonne also said it would be 4 hours labor. I called several independent shops and was quoted $200 for parts and labor. I guess 4 is there magic number.

Again in the morning I take it back. Again they check it send me on my way 30 minutes later car hot again. I call and was pretty much brushed off and was told that they fixed what they thought was the problem. So as of right now I've been charged all this money car still running hot n they acting like it's cool I came in with 1 problem which has still not to be resolved. I will I'm so disappointed I travel alot for work and I'm in Alabama all alone no family I came here expecting a1 service seeing that it's connected to a napa but to spend this type of money and my issue not be fixed I'm so disappointed.

They replaced the battery and alternator 500.00.  Two weeks later she is getting warning lights on the dashboard. Fearing that it might be more problems, when she came home for a wedding, I called Greystone Auto and took it in for a diagnostic. In less then 30 mins, results were in; defective alternator(new) . The folks at Greystone called the Atlanta shop and coordinated an under warranty replacement. That was a blessing not to have to worry about my daughter having a malfunctioning car while living there alone.\nI have always gotten good service and fair prices here. I have had at least 5 repairs done there and never a complaint.\nThanks Brooke and all the folks there for easing our anxieties.! Now I have another review to write about that Atlanta shop \ud83d\ude21!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889160b980004b5:0x21b3e6e8311ec771"}

Unfortunately we were slammed this morning so we apologize if we were not able to get to you sooner at the counter. We were not able to install this for you because you bought the part through Autozone and for legal reasons we must install our own parts in the shop. We would never discriminate or take advantage of anyone based on their gender, the reason we could not help you is simply because the part was not purchased through us. If you'd like to discuss this further, feel free to call us at the shop. Thank you."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889160b980004b5:0x21b3e6e8311ec771"}
