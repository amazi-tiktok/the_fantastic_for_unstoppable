I had an issue with my computer charge port so I dropped it off to get it diagnosed for repair. I was later told it was the DC jack needing replaced and the repair would cost 150.00. I was blown away at the price so I decided to think on it. Shawn told me the part alone cost 50 dollars. I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue. Additionally I found the part on eBay new for less than 20 dolllars. Not to mention the fact that the diagnoses when they originally took it apart would have been an extra screw to replace the DC jack which he tried charging me another 100 bucks. All together a very bad experience and I would rather avoid this place at all cost.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507037043493, "text": "sir we dont use ebay parts\nsorry for the drive being left out\neverybody makes mistakes\nand the diagnoses you was informed about up front\nu did not have to leave it'\nsorry for ur inconvenience"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892928318bc5bf3:0x74cb69ce96d94207"}

I hired him to repair the circuit board in my welder. Paid him for the job, which only half of it was done. Asked him to replace all of the capacitors on the board. He did not. He left a diode that he had cut loose. The soldering was the worst looking hack jobs I have ever seen. He picked up the board and was paid $90 initially to check it on the machine. I had to drive to Dothan to retrieve it from him and paid the balance of $145. Installed the board and the welder has no output at all now. Originally agreed upon price was $220. When I got the board back the diode was never reconnected, the solder joints were ridiculously poor. And the welder still does not work. He came out and wanted another $25 to \u201ccheck\u201d the board again. He came and \u201cchecked\u201d the board again. He said there is another bad part on the board. How could there be another bad part if he checked the whole board. So after seeing the poor workmanship displayed. I asked for a partial refund. He said no. So now I am out $235 and my welder still doesn\u2019t work. If I had only known that he couldn\u2019t do the job to start with, I would never have hired him to do it. This guy does not know what he is doing! Please save your hard earned money. Seek out a professional.
