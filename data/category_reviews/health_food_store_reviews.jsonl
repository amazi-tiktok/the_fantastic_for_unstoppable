The reason I'm giving you 3 stars is because your sales service seems to be misinformed and quite rude. I came in today (5/30/17) for creatine monohydrate. I left with nothing. The young girl running the store today asked why monohyrdate and when I voiced my \"opinion\" of this being the most researched and proven form of creatine I was scoffed at. This was baffling because I assumed her to have experience being the only one present in the store. Anyone with experience in the fitness industry knows this statement to be factual. The National Center for Biotechnology and Information as well as the International Society of Sports Nutrition have published many medical journals/articles regarding this. Okay, so maybe she was trying to sell me another product, fine I understand it's a business. It doesn't stop there though. Then she proceeds to tell me that another product creatine glycerol phosphate is superior to creatine monohydrate and all of Metabolic Nutrition's products have been evaluated by the FDA. This was quite concerning. First of all, you are misleading people. The FDA does not regulate dietary supplements. I showed her on the bottle where it clearly says \"These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to treat, cure, prevent or diagnose any disease\". I explained this by referencing the H.R.4771 - Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014. My point behind this was the only time the FDA steps in for supplements is after they have been to the shelf in stores and caused problems. She informs me that the act did not stop Pro-Hormones from being sold and asked if I was going to run and tell on them for selling them.. REALLY?? Furthermore, she had no knowledge of how the other product was superior. She told me she believed this product to be better because of what other customers have told her. Hearsay and reading the label, assuming it to be factual is not very scientific. If you want to sell a product this is not the way to do it! Additionally, I would like to say on my last visit to Absolute the service I received from Jordan was excellent. He was quite experienced, friendly, and informed regarding the products we discussed. Overall I probably won't let this incident stop me from shopping here, but in my opinion misleading people from the truth should not go unheard and if you don't know the truth perhaps you shouldn't be speaking.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496194866647, "text": "Hi Mitchell,\n\nI'm very sorry to hear your experience with us today was a negative one.

Our sign, placed in front of the door where you actually have to read it and go around it to access the door states, and I quote exactly: \"ATTENTION - IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MASK OR FACIAL COVERING, PLEASE STAY OUTSIDE. WE WILL CURBSIDE YOUR ORDER. CALL 334-277-9925.\n\nThe sign also states: \"DUE TO THE RISK OF CONTAMINATION, ALL SALES ARE FINAL - NO REFUNDS.\"\n\nYou were not refused service as you have incorrectly stated - you were refused entrance to the INSIDE of our business since you had no facial covering. You were given the option to our curb side service - which you refused to take advantage of. We provide a nice, socially distanced safe outside sitting area for those without masks or facial coverings to use. We actually have a large amount of customers who prefer the outdoor curbside service and delivery option.\n\nWe require this of everyone - regardless of race, color, gender, religious or political orientation. Why you consider yourself some elite exception in that you feel that you have some special entitlement, are better than all our other customers,  and can disregard our store policy, which has been in effect for many months now, I do not know - and there are no exceptions to our store entrance policy. We are a privately owned and operated local, family business - and we set the store policy here.\n\nYou are not entitled or above all our other customers who follow the store policy and are very, very happy to be able to shop in such a sanitary, healthy and very friendly 32+ year service and community oriented business\n\nAll of us wear our correct facial coverings all day long. We do take short breaks from wearing the coverings when not in the store to allow for C02 reduction and etc - but are right back on when back inside the store.\n\nFunny, but no one here remembers anyone of your mask intolerance issue trying to come in. What ever - there is an outside curbside service area for those reading this post who may have some type of facial mask/covering issue that can benefit from this incident, and know there is an outside curbside service option for them.\n\nWe  hope you find your happy place to shop. We are extremely busy assisting our correctly attired and extremely satisfied multi-generational customers."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a2e56267227:0xff334b082af99c2c"}

I\u2019ve seen them grow into a welcome presence in the natural homeopathic all in one stop shop they are today. They offer so much more than vitamins & minerals. Fresh organic sustainable food, and dry goods that rival any large grocery store. I\u2019ve bought probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins, minerals, alkaline water and so much more. They offer local products too, like honey and candles. The personalized one on one service they offer is above and beyond any local store. They are kind, compassionate and helpful to anyone asking questions when faced with so many choices. Anything and everything they ever suggested for me helped me so much. Now, with the Covid-19, they are asking people to wear masks in the store or plan to call ahead and order what you need and they will bring it out to you, curbside. People complaining they cannot wear a mask have the alternative to call from their car, make an order and literally in seconds they bring it to your car. I also have health issues where I cannot breath if I wear a mask. I ordered a couple minutes before reaching their store and had my purchase soon as I pulled into the parking lot. I don\u2019t understand people thinking the store staff try to push only the products that they use themselves. They have not done that to me in all my times in store. Well. That doesn\u2019t include the time they suggested some tasty tea, though. All in all, there\u2019s not another place around that offers what Healthwise Foods does. Check them out for yourself.

Healthwise is the store you have been searching for!\n\nI have shopped at Healthwise for over 15 years. The owners stay on the leading edge of knowledge related to health and nutrition. They are always available to assist you with answering your questions. They have never rushed me and they take the time to answer all my questions. I trust them for their extensive knowledge of nutritional and holistic treatments and practices.\n\nAdditionally, I trust them to validate and verify that their suppliers are actually providing the product identified on the package. Many large chain stores and grocery stores sell brands that are nothing but sawdust and powder. You can be confident you are getting the product on the label. They also sell grass-fed beef and other meat products that are healthy for you -- not full of hormones and antibiotics.\n\nThe owners require their staff members to train on which herbs or supplements would be the best solution to address whatever health condition you are trying to treat. The staff is very friendly and they are right there to help you if you have a health related question, or you can't find a product you are looking for.\n\nI realize the are other health stores in the local marketplace. I have stepped into some of them as I was driving around town. I was curious about their knowledge of health and nutrition, the suppliers they purchased from, and the prices they were charging for the different products I regularly purchase. I could not find any store who could match the knowledge of owners and staff at Healthwise. The range of products were usually not as extensive as Healthwise and the prices were comparable to Healthwise.\n\nI trust the owners of Healthwise and the quality of the products they sell.

I\u2019m in 50s and trying so hard to stay healthy and keep my mask on in public. Where I live in AL, today we had the highest COVID spike on record. None of your three servers had masks and looked oblivious to my question (polite) why they didn\u2019t. We are in the middle of a pandemic. I stated this concern on their ig and they blocked me. As they say below, posting on their ig concerns is not in their opinion acceptable. As any business knows,  social media is where people can comment positive or negative concerns. If companies delete anything that is not glowing it shows a refusal to truly address customer concerns. Why not publicly state your official policies. Any successful co will allow feedback \u2014good or bad\u2014 so long as it\u2019s not vulgar.  This refusal to care about customers health,  and then to not reply reasonably to feedback is not acceptable. There is no admission in your reply to me that there is any policy re this public health matter. Im appalled as a franchise that you allow this and I\u2019m quite upset. I was a regular but no more. It appears that teenagers unmasked are calling the shots. If you are in the food industry in AL and watching the news you need to realize that this is unsafe.These unmasked kids have parents and grandparents and can be asymptomatic and pass it on to them, others and your customers. The employee stated \u201cwe don\u2019t have to wear them.\u201d  You are now saying they do?? It\u2019s not clear. Did you change your policies yesterday? Was the employee making that up?

Some of the cashiers know us and it's sometimes hard to decide which checkout line to choose...I want to say hi to all our WF friends! WF has this awesome policy that if a product rings up incorrectly, you automatically get the item for free. The cashiers sometimes take this one step further---any complaints we've had about something we've bought (we bought some expired hummus once...we were overcharged once...etc) have been taken care of with a replacement---no questions asked. Also, WF is willing to track down and order items you're interested in. Not only that, but they then tend to keep that item in stock! :) The only thing I can't give a positive review of is their buffet. While there are plenty of options at the buffet---even for vegans, the food just isn't that good. And it's a bit pricey. Twice we have eaten there, and twice we have been disappointed.

By now, it's been open 4 months or so and I will assume has hit its stride.\n\nThe hot bar/salad bar area is definitely below average.  It's been the same dried out meat, sweet potatoes and other southern items ever since it opened and the variety is lackluster at best.  Did I mention the meat is always dried out?\n\nThe labels on the hot/salad bar are not always there and I don't trust the ingredients.  The stir fry obviously contained vegetables that weren't on the label - I believe bamboo shoots.  Coupled with missing labels, the degree of confidence in the food is mediocre.\n\nThe asian rice bowl and mexican food sections are decent as well.  It's a bit disappointing to me that they use dark meat chicken for both places.  Again, the meat did not look fresh either.  At the rice bowl, they couldn't answer questions as far as ingredients for people with food allergies.\n\nLastly, the selection in the actual store itself is significantly smaller than other Whole Foods in Atlanta and Nashville.  While not every special snowflake request can be satisfied for food allergies, their depth and breadth of gluten free products was disappointing.  No gluten free croutons and other limited options are not what I would have expected in a Whole Foods.  The new Walmart neighborhood market had an equally competitive selection for less price.\n\nSo overall, compared to other Whole Foods, this one is.. bleh.
