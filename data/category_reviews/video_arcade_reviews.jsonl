The kids didn\u2019t get setup and playing until around 1:40 (leaving only an hour to play).  At 2:40 the kids we sent into the party room to eat pizza and open presents.  At 2:50 the guy came in to inform us that we had to be out of there within 10 minutes.  Keep in mind that we paid for 2 hours of playing for the kids and it took 45+ minutes before they all could start playing. The guy that was working informed us that it normally isn\u2019t this troublesome and he wasn\u2019t sure what was wrong  ( we even had a PC crash in the middle of a game within 5 minutes after we finally got it up and running). I will say the only positive to the experience was how nice the staff was but for $275 I expected to at least get an hour and 40 minutes of playing time before eating and we only received maybe an hours worth.

I came here with my girlfriend and it makes a great date night or a cool family night out. The staff is super fun and helpful. The restaurant is also super good. It's not just cheap arcade food, it's super fresh and made right in front of you! Highly recommend whether you're into video games or not! They really have something for everyone; 6 Solo Virtual Reality Booths, 2 Multiplayer Virtual Reality Booths, a ton PCs, 7 XboxOnes, 7 PS4s, and 2 Custom Virtual Reality Racecars!! The restaurant has custom made pizzas, subs, salads, wings, soft drinks, 20 beers on tap, and a few wines too!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN243hWZup0llhJuoxiJrVJGvuKobJVa0uORIU6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBBCkReFiwysRsBH-8fTKeXGzxWHw5y5g6sVax=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi1lBcq5ThDYOdSFPCJsU4AyAXWSKTi94lc2I9=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGOFNtQVqXNInQYmgISiArWQc5G2GoymKxe853=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwxc6o__fLKDeYX5KHxO9nxFvNJm1q5uAGMg-h=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1580536527066, "text": "Thank you for your review!

The bar service is great, but the food service is a joke. One person in our group had to wait over an hour for a personal pizza turns out they had given her pizza to someone else, another waited over 40 minutes for wings and only got them because they went up to ask about them and was told they had forgotten. Our table had also gotten cluttered with a bunch of glasses and plates and had asked for someone to come clear it off but no one ever came. Love to bowl here but will definitely eat beforehand.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb6158566ef7:0x44ad879c3f9b25c8"}

He's also constantly working to improve his business and make sure everyone that walks in the door has a great time. He also runs a pretty dope YouTube channel called Nerd Torch TV.\n\nThe store is organized and managed extremely well. There are several rooms dedicated to different types of gaming. There is a room for tabletop games, another for rhythm games like Guitar Hero or DDR, and other rooms dedicated to console games. There's even a PC built for gaming. Multiplayer games are very popular and this is a great place to find people that love to play Smash. I don't think I've ever been to the cafe when there wasn't someone playing Smash or Mario Cart. There's a great community built up around the cafe as well. All of the cafe members are invited to a GroupMe chat where you can get updates on events or just chat and hang out.

They use HTC VIVE headsets and controllers that are wired to the ceiling so there's minimal cord confliction. When you're renting a station (out of the 4 or 5 available), Susanne and Bryce assisted my brother and I with making sure everything was comfortable and adjusted properly for an unhindered experience. The headset and controllers felt clean, so it would be safe to assume they're properly maintained. There's adequate spacing to go with virtual reality setups of course, and oddly enough that also works in favor for social distancing during the pandemic. The staff also enjoy looking for new forms of entertainment to accompany the VR experience, such as planks of wood for you to walk on during tightrope VRs games. Aside from the VR stations themselves, they also have more space available for other parties and what not. You can also rent out the facility ahead of time for a closed group.\n\nWhile my brother and I had visited the location to see how we felt about VR at all, we in fact ended up enjoying our time there and got to see the lengths of dedication the staff had for their services. We paid $50 total for the both of us for an hour (during their Tuesday to I believe Saturday discount), which feels a slightly expensive but not too heavy for the occasional visit.
