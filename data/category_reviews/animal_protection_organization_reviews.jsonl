He needs some one who knows how to train him because he can get really excited when he's happy and we could not afford professionals. He's kept in crate overnight from 10pm to 6/7 am. He eats 3x daily 6-8a, 1p, 6-7p. Purina puppy chow. He's walked one hour after eating. And will scratch at door if he needs to \"do his business\". He's gonna get really big, but he's a sweetheart. He's a lab/pit mix. He received 2 rounds of puppy shots, dewormed, chewable nexguard flea & tick/heartguard for heartworm prevention at Gadsden Pet Clinic. He's a whole lot of joy and much work for a family that includes a baby the same age as him. We only allowed him in the living room as he grew and we were in a different part of house doing school work. Husband works 6 days a week and with an infant and 3 little ones I was exhausted.

This happened three times within two days, and then no one answered every time we called after that. I went to the shelter to see what the issue was, and one of the staff told me that a rescue that re-homes dogs throughout the country came and got her to take her to a no kill rescue to  save space in their shelter.

But after 5 months we felt it would be best to find her a good home a home with a bigger yard an someone that's younger. She was house broken all shots an chipped a great puppy. So today I just wanted to check to make sure they found her a good home see if I could bring her toys an if she was still there have some play time. They open at 10 am I call no answer I leave message no call back I call again for the next 2.5 hrs no answer. So I drive to the center went to the front desk an the lady ask if she could help me I said yes I drop off my puppy an I was-------- she cut me off an told me once I signed that paper she could not give out any info. Thanks for making me feel worst an all I wanted to do was to see what else I could do.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528995107775, "text": "Mr. Pearson, we are so sorry you had to give your puppy up. We understand things happen. That is why we are here, and as I type this, we have already taken in 11 since opening at 10am. Fortunately, we average about 50 adoptions each month and try our absolute best to save everything we can. Because of the overwhelming number of animals that come in to the staff of 8, it was set forth years ago that while you are welcome to stop in or check Facebook for those up for adoptions, the board and staff have the policy in place that once surrendered, we cannot personally discuss updates. With such a small team and upwards of 4000 souls coming in each year, it would be impossible to speak with every family. We hope that you are off to a great Summer and that you will consider adoption in the future. We, along with other area shelters, appreciate those that come back, once situations change. Have a safe Summer, sir."}, "gmap_id": "0x888a3c9fa16c132f:0x4a8d12750fd21da"}
