I reiterated the need for the pumping as we had holiday guests and really who wants to ask their guests to do their business in the woods. I was told they would be out Thursday. On Wednesday my 13 year old and I put gravel going to the RV to make sure the truck wouldn't get stuck with heavy rains. Not exactly a fun chore. On Thursday I called to see when the service truck would arrive only to be told that it wouldn't be this week at all. I explained that this had inconvenienced me, 13 year old, and a 91 year old and I would like to know exactly when they will provide the service. Chad then proceeded to tell me essentially.....we were out of his way. At this point I've decided to go elsewhere. Horrible customer service, lack of concern, and apparently unable to show up.

Our account is a residential weekly pickup of recyclables and garbage, and we switched to them last Fall 2019 because we were really taken by their salesman -- probably not the salesperson described in some of these reviews. Since then, we've had reliable pickup every single week, including holidays. Every time I had a billing question over the phone, I received great service (special shoutout to \"Tori\") and pleasant conversation. This current week was the only time they missed a pickup, and a call to Tori clarified that, not surprisingly, they are not picking up recyclables because of the current pandemic.

There's a reason that certain companies in this area have been around for literally 5 decades, and it was done by building a clientele through RELIABLE, FAIR PRICING slowly instead of lying to people about services / going door to door price gouging other companies until they raise the prices after those companies go out of business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fb390038f77:0xfdf085053b546d73"}
