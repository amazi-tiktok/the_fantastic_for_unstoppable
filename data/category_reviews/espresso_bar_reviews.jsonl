At other foodservice locations in the same building and operated by the same company, not even students are charged for water glasses. That one event does a good job summarizing the apathy and disregard the employees have for their customers. Another critical issue is that this location doesn't accept Starbucks's own rewards program, which is extremely annoying after having signed up for the program just for the convenience of the location being in the same building that I work for.
