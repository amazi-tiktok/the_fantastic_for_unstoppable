I have been a patient over 10 years.  Lynn and Amy work the front office and provide excellent service and dedication not only to Dr. Pugh but to his patients.  Since the front office is open to the lobby you can hear every conversation these ladies have with patients, insurance companies and staff. It has never been anything but professional.  They greet every  patient coming in the door with a smile, good morning and how is your family.  They call and get appointments for patients with specialists, they contact insurance companies to find out what your coverage will be for needed dental work and about visits that aren't paid for what ever reason.   Last year I had a bill that was not paid by my insurance company $1,500, I called them and they said it wasn't covered and would be my responsibility.  I paid the bill.  Amy called me about a month later and told me that she had contacted the insurance company and sent an appeal she got the bill paid and now had a refund check for me!  The office had been paid by me there was no reason for Amy to do this but she went above and beyond her duties to help me get my money back.

I told them I will call my insurance comapny to check this,then if I have to pay this extra,I will.

Because of this my pain threshold is high so if I say something hurts it really hurts. My previous dental office was aware of this yet the hygienist chose to ignore the pain I was experiencing. After speaking with the office manager I decided I would not complete my appointment and later called back and canceled any further treatment with that practice. I called my insurance company and located the office of a previous dentist that I loved and I am so glad I did. I called Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace and even the interaction over the phone was pleasant. Whitney was able to schedule me an appointment quickly and educated me on the processes and procedures and what to expect. I could hear her smile through the phone. The day of my appointment, the entire staff was absolutely wonderful! As a new patient for the practice I knew I would have paperwork and would probably be there for a while but as soon as I finished my paperwork my hygienist was waiting for me. Chelsey greeted me with smiling eyes (she had on her mask), explained the process in depth and after reviewing my x-rays she recommended the best next step to help with my issues. She listened and made sure to understand what I was experiencing and throughout my appointment she made sure the process was not causing too much pain. With tender swollen gums pain is to be expected however if the hygienist knows what they are doing the patient will experience minimal pain. Chelsey knows what she is doing! She took a potentially mouth throbbing, tears running uncomfortable situation and made it a pleasant and educational experience. I went in with my mouth feeling awful and because of what Chelsey did my teeth feel so much better. Because I am a cancer warrior my teeth and gums have gone through some major changes. Chemo, radiation and long term medication has caused damage that I thought was going to take radical treatment to repair but Chelsey explained how to minimize further damage and what to do to get me on a path of recovery. She was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace, you will not be disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621012488256, "text": "Wow to that wonderful review!

They use Transworld System collection agency when Tonya makes a mistake with your treatment plan and tells you your insurance will pay half and you pay the other half ($560) and then it turns out TONYA read it wrong but expects the patient to pay for her mistake you will get turned over to a collection agency! I liked Dr. Bentley and was very disappointed she let her office manager get away with dirty office practices, so I had no other choice but to find another dentist for my son and I. Tonya wouldn\u2019t let me speak to Dr. Bentley she twisted what happened to fit her narrative and let Dr.Bentley think they were doing me a favor by cutting the bill in half when all along Tonya knows this is on her! And she sent a $240 bill to collections on a procedure that wasn\u2019t even done correctly (we were told my son didn\u2019t need a crown turns out he did but because of Tonyas error reading our policy which is her job by the way we never went back to Dr.Bentley after getting a $500 bill in the mail no phone call Tonya knew I would be upset and she knew exactly what she told me) and the tooth had to be extracted after all of that! So NO  I do not recommend you go there! Not because of Dr. Bentley but because you cannot trust Tonya to do your insurance and billing correctly! Do you have an extra $1000.00  laying around when you get a surprise bill from Tonya? When I asked Tonya why she didn\u2019t catch that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover that procedure she said to me well neither did you! Wow!! Tonya claimed to have gotten an approval for the procedure when all along root canals weren\u2019t covered within the first year of coverage (so that was a lie to cover her mistake) I would have thought an office manager and the person who is supposed to verify insurance would check that first thing! I have never had this happen before over 30 years of taking myself and 2 kids to the dentist! So there you have it!

Unfortunately with insurance they always have the disclaimer that it is an estimate and not a guarantee of payment.  As a courtesy we strive to help our patients by handling all the dental billing rather than collecting all payments up front for procedures creating the hassle for the patient to handle all billing to his or her own insurance.  It's a partnership where we rely on what the insurance provides us and what the insurance provides to the patient about their own coverage.

A technician cleaned my teeth, the dentist walked in for a cursory review, said fine and walked out. The charge was almost $100 more than my dentist, also, my dentist cleans my teeth, not a technician. We come to Orange Beach for six weeks very year,  but never back to this place.\n\nYour reply to my comments discussed, among other things, COVID-19 virus. I visited you last fall, long before this  COVID-19.  Your fee was not my main concern. The last time a technician cleaned my teeth, l was in the military. I guess things are different in Alabama.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596400819600, "text": "Charles, thank you for the feedback. We are sorry that your appointment was unlike what you are accustomed to. Many years ago, dentists actually did clean every patient\u2019s teeth. Now, in most offices, a teeth cleaning is performed by a trained dental hygienist, while dentists and their assistants perform a wide variety of procedures on each patient in their chair, from fillings and crowns to dental implants and extractions.\n\nDental hygienists complete schooling to not only be able to perform dental cleanings, but to also spot issues in a patient\u2019s mouth. Hygienists alert the dentist to potential problems that could lead to restoration work down the road. They are also the ones that teach your at-home care, and help you with problem areas that need improving like flossing, how to brush and sharing information about the right products to be using. Hygienists are licensed by the state and are required to complete a certain amount of continuing education every year. Hygienists at OBFD always take more than the required amount of CE hours to benefit our patients.\n\nAt Orange Beach Family Dentistry, we pride ourselves on using the most up-to-date training and technology from x-rays that use the least possible radiation, intra oral and extra oral cancer screenings on every patient, and the highest quality instruments and products, all in an environment that is comfortable and inviting. Not to mention, all of the extra precautions we have implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic, such as air purification systems to capture and kill viral particles, UVC lights to kill the virus, extra PPE,  N95 and KN95 masks, and disinfection of every room way above the requirements of OSHA.\n\nHowever, Dr. Lee has been careful that all of the extra costs associated with COVID 19 have not been pushed onto patients despite the highly inflated prices of PPE and disinfection supplies. If a patient does not have dental insurance, we offer an in-house membership plan which discounts all of our services.\n\nIn the case of this review, it sounds like the major concern was the cost and not the quality of care. As you pointed out, you have a dentist in your hometown willing to provide some level of service for a lower rate that you are satisfied with. Thank you for your patronage and we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a064474746535:0xa4e70150be002f0c"}

I tried reaching the office for 2 days and the phone was forwarded to another number. Nobody called me back. On the 3rd day somebody finally answered the phone. The unfriendly receptionist on the other end said they would only be open until noon and the office would be closed until jan 2 for 2 weeks for the holidays. They could let dentist take a look then. I told her I couldnt wait that long and didnt want to get an infection. She reluctantly let me come in. I went in and the dentist redid my fillings. Upon leaving receptionist said there would be a $75 office visit fee. I had paid $800.00 previously for the failed dental work. I told her I didnt feel like I owed her any more money. She insisted I pay it and furthermore said she could have charged me again to rebuild the teeth. Personally I would fire any body who spoke to my clients that way. She should be terminated. The dentist seems kind enough but I question the quality of her work and definitely think she should get some new employees for her office that return phone calls and treat customers with kindness and respect. I will not be returning to orange beach family dentistry!\n\nRESPONSE TO YOUR REPLY TO MY REVIEW....\nObviously you are not the owner of Orange Beach Family dentistry as you refer to the dentist in the 3rd person. Yet another lie. You are the same flunky receptionist who was rude from the start and continues to be online. As for the original good review I left I have an explanation for. Since you used a ridiculous analogy to explain your rudeness and incompetence I will also reply with an analogy so maybe it will be easier for you to understand.\n\nImagine you go on a first date with someone and you think it went pretty well. Then you go on a second date and find out what a liar and cheater she really is. You then wish that the first date never happened. That's a lot like the reasoning for my first review. I have no dislike for Lauren the dentist, everybody makes mistakes. But you should own up to them and stand behind your work. I do hold her responsible for letting you handle her business and respond to her google reviews. It's definitely a mistake and I'm sure In time you will be terminated because your smart mouth is bad for business! Furthermore letting dogs run loose in your office and letting them lick peoples hands while they are in the dentist chair is unsanitary and just plain stupid, not to mention a health code violation.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1577680972270, "text": "Frankie, Thank you for taking the time to voice your opinion again after the positive review you left us in the past. Because of privacy regulations, we can\u2019t discuss any specifics about your comments. However, we are committed to providing you the highest quality care, and we take your feedback very seriously.\nAt Orange Beach Family Dentistry, we pride ourselves on answering and returning patient phone calls in a timely and courteous manner. When the office is closed, an employee always has an \"on call\" phone and calls are returned immediately. All of the roadwork on Canal Road has caused Mediacom to go out occasionally and the phone lines go down for brief periods. However, it is rare that this happens.\nDr. Lauren Lee takes great pride in using the highest quality products & techniques when treating patients. Every case is unique with its own set of circumstances. Not every patient agrees to ideal treatment, which sometimes means a not ideal outcome.\n\nIf your car tire has a hole and the recommended solution is to get a new tire but you decide to patch it instead...will you be surprised if it keeps going flat? You can use all of your money to keep patching your tire over and over, or you can spend more money for the ideal solution of getting a brand new tire.\nAnd if you go to a car repair shop and get a tire patched up, will it not cost the shop money for materials used? How much does it cost the shop to add new air and new materials? Some customers may get their car fixed but threaten to write a bad review so that they don't have to pay for the service they received. Other customers are rude to the employees of the car shop, & the employees would like to charge the customer triple the amount, but instead they smile & give 5-Star customer service."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a064474746535:0xa4e70150be002f0c"}

We could have \"charged\" $1000 for the work you had done, and we would have been paid the same and written off a higher amount.  In fact, we typically have to write off ~33% of everything we do.

Cindy did my cleaning, if you can call it that (bloodbath might be more accurate). The pick kept slipping and gouging my gums and it was extremely painful. According to her, my previous dental hygienists didn't do a thing to remove the plaque from my teeth because she announced that my mouth was in terrible shape, and didn't I know that I was supposed to brush my teeth regularly? When she started in on flossing and waggled her blood-stained fingers in front of my eyes, I got dizzy and started crying.\n\nDr. Peters came in next and said, \"I hear you've been having some trouble! Did you know you're supposed to brush and floss your teeth? You have to be good about it, or else your teeth will end up looking like this...\" at which point he gestured to a horrifying picture mounted on the wall featuring blackened and rotting teeth. He told me that my teeth shouldn't be so bad for someone my age and the cleaning shouldn't be so painful unless I haven't been taking care of them. People, I have been seeing dentists twice a year throughout my entire life, keeping up with my regular cleanings and x-rays, and no dentist has ever been this critical of me. I think Cindy was rough and careless, and defended herself against my crying by saying that I had terrible and highly sensitive teeth, and Dr. Peters took her at her word instead of asking her to leave the room and talking to me alone.\n\nBetween the condescension from both of them and the heavy-handed pick wielding, I will never ever recommend this practice, nor will I ever return there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c63473f0a7:0x3a08d1ab8b3a429e"}

I recently cracked a tooth, and I was referred to a local dentist, so I decided to give them a try. Folks, just because someone has a fancy office does not mean that they are a reputable business, at least in my experience. It is not typical of me bad mouthing a local business and I will keep their name out of this review, but they are an embarrassment to the noble profession of dentistry. When I was seen by the hygienist, she responded, \"Oh wow that is bad, you will need to have that tooth extracted immediately\". My initial thought was \"I didn't realize that a hygienist was also a doctor of dentistry\". Then when the dental assistant took the x-rays, her response was identical! What made matters worse the doctor backed up what they said and wanted to extract the tooth right there and then!!! I was concerned and confused so I asked what the cost would be. They brought in the \"closer\" with the three options. Just yank it, yank it and create a cap with a bridge like a denture or the option that I would probably have chosen, yank it and have an implant which would have cost over three thousand dollars, oh, by the way they have a company that will finance.\nThanks, but no thanks!\nSo, I walked out and I waited, maybe too long because I got a bad abscess. Now what do I do?\nI researched and talked to many folks. I decided to give Southern dentistry a try and thank God I did. They got me in the next morning. Everyone that I came in contact with was very professional and friendly. From the receptionist to the dentist. The dental assistant took the x-ray and told me that the doctor will be with me shortly. Most of my experiences with doctors or dentists are that if you have an appointment be prepared to wait an hour or two before someone sees you. I was seen within a few minutes. Dr. Jessica Robinson was great, very professional and to the point and explained everything in detail. She recommended against extracting the tooth. She believed that the tooth can be saved. Her recommendation was to perform a root canal with a crown at a cost of less than a third of what the other dentist recommended! Very short and to the point treatment plan. NO FINANCING NEEDED!\nHow refreshing and what a great place. For once a dentist that understands CUSTOMER SERVICE! I highly recommend Southern dentistry. You will not be disappointed.\nRAVING FAN", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626896010651, "text": "Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a42208bd7a8c1:0x31556a24d6a98934"}

{"user_id": "112224890650932522378", "name": "Alyssa Stellmaker", "time": 1624936690983, "rating": 3.0, "text": "This review is in response to a request sent to me after a dental procedure and included a side note that a review of less than 5-stars should be called into the office rather than placed online.  Dealing directly with the office was unresponsive. I\u2019ve been a patient at Southern Dentistry, with Dr. Nebrig, for 3+ years, with numerous procedures performed. I don\u2019t expect perfection; but, when a business won\u2019t/can\u2019t get you in to see the dentist for pain related to work that he performed and waiting too long could cause further or more serious damage, those little, previously forgiven imperfections compound.\n\nCons:  scheduling and communication.  Can\u2019t get in to see a dentist; even as an established patient, for a dental emergency, or to get a newly placed crown adjusted. If there is a problem with dental work that was completed there-such as a crown that\u2019s too high, pain/possible tooth infection/root canal needed after dental repair 3 weeks prior but persistent pain when chewing, the office will, literally, tell you that they are \u201ctoo busy\u201d to see you. You have to schedule a regular appt, which is many months out.  Neither pain, facial bruising, nor new pain at the contact tooth will matter. One of the assistants who places crowns will ignore a patient\u2019s cry of pain in hopes of rapidly finishing the crown fitting on a raw tooth. When the crown felt a little high during it\u2019s placement, the assistant didn\u2019t dry the tooth before using the chalk paper and told me to wait until I wasn\u2019t numb and to give the teeth time to adjust; they\u2019d move around a bit and I could easily come back in to get it adjusted. The amalgam fillings have a rough/sandy texture that leaves the tooth constantly feeling dirty.   The wait time before work/cleaning begins is often 45-60 min.  If insurance covers at 50%, you overpay before the work is done at a 40% coverage. This policy is left to the patient to discover. When questioning the math for the estimates and lack of refunds or j completed work, they say they will reimburse the difference after all the insurance claims have paid.  After all of the work that\u2019s been done, I\u2019m aware of only one reimbursement.  Perhaps, the overpayments were applied to other procedures and they forgot to tell me. My insurance claims for one procedure showed that I had overpaid Southern Dentistry by something like $86 and the front office confirmed the same amount a couple months after the claim. When I was at my next procedure and asked to have that $86 reimbursement applied to the current procedure, the office said I had $8 owed to me and my \u201cinsurance must not have paid fully for an X-ray or something.\u201d  (They didn\u2019t apply the $8 toward the current procedure or give me the money back.) Providing patients with a break down receipt that shows the portions the patient and insurance paid, and the refund owed to the patient would enhance trust and clarity.  At one appt, the office was in such a hurry to get patients out the door that they skipped my annual X-rays and said they would do them at the next cleaning, in 6 months.\n\nPros:  Dr. Nebrig has a charismatic and laid back, jubilant personality. He does a great job numbing the area that will receive work and calming an anxious patient.  He takes pride in and enjoys his work, and completes the procedures quickly.  Same day crowns drastically improve an unpleasant and time consuming dental procedure.  The office location is convenient. Silver fillings aren\u2019t used.  The hygienists, assistants, and dentist are friendly and gentle.  The sport-top water bottles provided  after a procedure exemplifies attention to detail and patient needs. The facility is clean. The office accepts a lot of different insurances. The business wants patient feedback.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626896853017, "text": "Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a42208bd7a8c1:0x31556a24d6a98934"}

I was a little upset that I had to call to reschedule my appointment, originally for 4/6, (due to COVID)... I guess I just thought that the patients in pain, would at least get a call FIRST to reschedule any important procedures - that didn't happen. Thankfully, I called in late April & was able to get an appt for today, 5/27. I get there at 10:20, my appointment time, let them know I'm there, only to be told, \"You're appointment is scheduled for 11:10\". This was due some type of system issue they were having (understandable, not their fault). BEFORE they take payment, she goes over what they are doing today + how much it would cost. I immediately asked if that price included the nitrous oxide gas (my cost $50). She said no and amended my new payment to include the gas. After waiting for way longer than usual, I was called in and told, \"I'm sorry, the truck hasn't delivered the oxygen\".\nYes, I had about 2-3 panick/anxiety attacks in the chair but after 2 hours of crying, it isfis .... for now.\nNow, I'm in lots of pain and I can't even begin to describe it ... I can't open my mouth + chewing is OUT of the Question!!!!\nI really hope Dr. Nebrig and his staff makes this right bc I thought I FINALLY found a dentist that I can trust + does good work at good prices.\n***********************************************\n(August 2019) Dr. Nebrig and his staff are MARVELOUS. The environment is very relaxing. I was called back as soon as I arrived (literally no wait time in the lobby - not used to such a quick call back once I check in at other facilities I've visited in the past \ud83d\ude43). I was greeted with smiling faces and just felt \"Welcomed\". The girls were the most amazing assistants with my VERY FIRST root canal! They went over + above to ensure I was in as little discomfort as possible. Sidney even brought me a blanket while I waited on my crown to be delivered. Dr. Nebrig has an amazing bedside manner and is very kind and considerate. The staff called me the next morning to check and see how I was doing.

I am so happy that we were able to work things out with your insurance, so that you can continue your dental treatment. Thank you also for coming in and talking to me. Great to see you again!!\n\nHi Jesse. I am sorry that you are having problems with YOUR insurance company. I have many, many patients with BC/BS insurance whose services are paid for by BC/BS. Please know that with BC/BS there are many, many benefit levels on these individual plans. These plans are elected and paid for by your employer or yourself but reimbursed at different rates. The higher the premium results in better coverage. We have found that some plans pay very well while others cause the patient to pay more in principle than what is actually received as a benefit. Due to the confusion and the large number of insurance plans we call the insurance company as a courtesy to verify coverage for all new patients before seating them for treatment. With the information given to us from an insurance company like BC/BS we quote patient portions and offer advice to maximize benefits, but we can only be as accurate as the information that is given to us. Unfortunately, in this healthcare business there are times that claims are denied. Insurance companies are in business to be profitable for their investors. Usually, with additional patient information, documentation, charting and pictures that we obtain on your first visit, the claim can be refiled once we know why the claim was denied in the first place. If you bring your Explanation of Benefits to the office next week, I personally will help you resolve this so that you may be reimbursed or I will offer a refund that resulted from any error made by my office. I look forward to hearing from you next week. Sincerely, Ren\u00e9 A. Talbot, DDS (256)881-8181"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb0df2ccd01:0x8b39f086a9aaa930"}

From the moment I walked in until the time I left was nothing short of amazing. This facility is very clean and the staff was amazing. Everyone was very nice and very attentive.

She listens to me, answered all my questions and made sure I knew everything I need to know once I went home. I absolutely love her and hope I can get her on my next visit in 2 weeks.

You are kept fully aware through every single step of the procedures so much that they are actually teaching you about your teeth. You are encouraged to ask questions along the way so you can fully understand and deepen your learning for proactive care in the future. Rhonda was fantastic at facilitating this. A valuable asset for sure.\n\nThe facility itself is nothing less than cutting edge. So cutting edge that in every attempt they will reduce the total amount of visits and time spent in the chair in total (as they understand going to the dentist is not typically the top of the list for most people). There\u2019s even a screen on the ceiling so, if you wish to, you can watch and see everything that is happening while they explain it.\n\nIt is like being at a 5* hotel- but at a dentist.

Well let me tell you the receptionist is nice and caring she was consistently staying on top of everything. She was making sure the patients that were on the move up list were able to get moved up as soon as there was an opening.\nI had an appointment a month out to get my wisdom tooth pulled, but I was assured if there was an opening available she would call and let me know.

The pain persisted after placing the permanent crown (on the second try, and it still did not look great on the X-ray).  I gave up on you as a dentist after the third or fourth bite-adjustment that did not solve the problem.  On the most recent visit (after my new dentist told me to go back to the person who placed the crown to get it re-done), you said that this crown is \"perfect\" and told me to go to an endodontist.  You also mentioned that you had told me before that the root could be damaged from previous tooth decay - you had not told me this about this specific tooth in the past, only a different tooth on which you had already performed a root canal.  According to the endodontist that did perform a root canal, the roots were in good shape - there is a crack in my tooth underneath the crown, which was the source of pain whenever debris got in the crack and irritated the root.  Whether this crack was because of a poor bite when I first got the crown or something else, I guess I'll never know.\n\nZero Stars: You lied to me.  I am listing several instances here, in no particular order:\n\n1.  As I already mentioned, you did not discuss this tooth and its root with me in the past as you stated at the most recent visit.  The assistant at that visit even looked for it in the chart notes and could not find it .\n\n2.  After the insurance claim for the crown was denied the final time, I asked you about the dentist's narrative on why it was necessary that should have been included in the files that were sent to the insurance.  You said you typed a full page for this, your receptionist said it was a few lines handwritten.  Neither of you could find a copy to provide to me.  When I was filing the appeal to the insurance company a few months prior, I asked if there was a narrative, and was not made aware that such a thing existed.  One or both of you lied directly to my face.\n* If you did not file anything because I was on the \"patient appreciation plan\" which states that you won't file insurance while I'm on it, you could have told me that and I would not have had an issue.  This was why I filed insurance on my own after paying you for the procedure, expecting them to reimburse me the covered percentage of what I paid; admittedly, I did not realize the amount of paperwork and effort needed for this.  Instead your office told me that you did file all the needed paperwork, which the insurance company never received.\n\n3.  I'm not even convinced that this crown was necessary (and there apparently is no narrative to state that it was).  Your office seems to put a higher priority on crowns and other high-dollar work than on fillings, which seems backwards to me as I would think that you would want to do a filling as soon as you find it so the tooth does not get bad enough to need a crown.  Another tooth of mine which you said would need a crown (which I never got from you because the pain on the other side of my mouth never stopped) currently has a filling from my new dentist.\n\n4.  You said an endodontist can remove and save the old crown to place it back on later.  This is incorrect, both endodontists I visited stated that they drill through the crown to perform the root canal.  This may not have been intentional, but I'm counting it as another lie.\n\n5.  After I got the root canal, some porcelain chipped off of another surface of the crown.  I called your office to ask about what material the base metal is (and if I should worry about corrosion) and was told that ALL the crowns you perform are pure zirconium and not porcelain-on-metal.  When I asked how that could be if mine clearly has exposed metal, the person on the phone got quite defensive ... like accusations of lying (perhaps not unfounded) is a common phenomenon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600008293148, "text": "David, I'm sorry you are unhappy.

However, respecting your privacy, I don't want to elaborate on what I think your experience may have been.\n\nUpdate: David, I am so happy that you have found a new dentist with a relationship that you have confidence and Trust in!

I went to Dr. Cook for options and after extensive discussion decided to put a new post in and a temporary crown so my dentist at home could then replace the temporary with a new crown. But when Dr Cook got into the process he discovered an old-school resin that had been used  to fill the root canal and determined that the chances of success for a new crown were significantly reduced. Rather than continuing with the new post, he simply glued the old crown back in place and suggested that I discuss my options with my dentist at home. Wow... He had the opportunity to charge me for a new post that probably would have been unsuccessful but instead was honest and told me that I would probably need an implant.\nPatient before profits. For me this is something significant and something I was extremely impressed by. On top of all of that, the office was friendly, extremely organized, and seamless throughout the entire process.

They were always mentioning teeth whitening, special mouth wash, special tooth paste etc. I am in the sales world so I get it, but don't be pushy. You can usually tell when a person is uncomfortable about the topics. Which I was.\n\nI received a quote for invisalign about a year ago, and decided to save. They quoted me 1800ish without insurance for that visit. Then this past visit they quoted me 3,325 after my insurance pays 1000. I thought that was a bit dramatic increase especially since my insurance now covers a grand.\n\nI go to my dentist every 6 months. I might go two months over, due to work scheduling, but I go regularly. I've never had cavity problems so 8 months ago when I was told I had 6 I almost fainted. I actively brush my teeth and floss multiple times a day. My family and friends make fun of how cautious I am when it comes to my oral health. I want to keep my teeth so I do care for them.  I was told I didn't floss enough and that I needed to start when I asked how it was possible to have 6 cavities. I felt like i was being degraded.  So I started brushing 3Xs daily and flossing after every meal. When I came back 8 months later (2 months over because of a work scheduling issue)  I had 4 more. Only then when I almost started to cry did the Dr. ask about my medical history. I have severe acid re-flux. Apparently that can cause the cavity issue. He then up-sales me on some ORA-Care mouth wash and told me to use it until my next visit. When I return to the next visit if I have additional cavities we will re-evaluate. I'm not sure that I would want to wait another 6 months to see if i get additional cavities even while using the mouth wash.\n\nWhen I went to schedule my filling appointment they told me I had to pay a percentage of the $250 cost before they scheduled me. I told them that I didn't have the money even though I did, and decided right then I would go back to Dr. Sonja Gill's office.\n\nI felt this office is only concerned about the money that goes into their pocket. I get businesses have to make money, but I have never not paid them. Even when I missed an appointment I paid them a $55 no show fee with no hesitation. I felt like I was their personal ATM.\n\nI will never go back to this practice again. I am going back to Dr. Sonja Gill where I am greeted with a smile, and they don't hold out their hand for your credit card every time you walk through the door.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583345035967, "text": "We apologize and will be contacting you to see how we can make it better for you."}, "gmap_id": "0x886268e976bb6b43:0x3c4d92c0b50a4a2c"}

Content with the service, I decided to have Divine Expressions as my primary and only dental care. And for the most part, it was good. The staff are incredibly friendly, extremely accommodating and very gentle during each cleaning. Not to mention the breathtaking, home magazine worthy office.\n\nWhere it pains me to write is related to Dr. Laurentis Barnett's procedures. Every procedure that dealt with a crown of some sort, always came off. It resulted in me either having to leave work early, take an extended lunch, take a day off and/or come back multiple times that same week. While the staff and Dr. Barnett was very accommodating and flexible with scheduling, the process were still very inconvenient. A particular case was getting an implant for one of my teeth. For starters, the tooth itself was shaped very oddly. It did not look or feel like a normal tooth. It also always popped off, even though the office used dental cement.\n\nWith every visit to either add or replace, I never received an answer as to why this kept happening. Dr. Laurentis also hinted that it was possibly my fault that the tooth kept coming off. I'm not opposed to thinking that I could've been doing something wrong, but after speaking with friends and colleagues with dental implants and explaining to them my daily routine and lifestyle, I was suggested to get an second opinion from another dental professional.\n\nI sought treatment elsewhere and unfortunately had to pay for another tooth implant. The implant printed from Divine Expressions leaves my new dental office with many questions as they have never seen such an odd shaped \"tooth\". My current implant from my new dentist has been in my mouth for nearly 2 months. I had not returned once for a re-application.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to defame or deface Dr. Laurentis Barnett, it is simply to write a review I felt needed to be written. I wish him and his office the best of success and hope that maybe this review will leave some food for thought. I'm glad there are a good number of patients that are satisfied with his service.

They didn't even know which tooth that I had a root canal on in there office just 1 month prior (this happened twice). One time I called, I was asked what the doctor told me on the last visit I went in.....this is disturbing considering they should keep record of what the doctor says each visit and overall what is actually going on. Also, it would seem smart to keep record of what a patient says for the reason they are needing to see the doctor again so that there is an overall knowledge with other office staff on the situation/patient.

He truly enjoys his craft and has a passion for teaching others about the dentistry profession (he's won a ton of awards). Personally--I don't even need to see the awards to know that he's an outstanding dentist. The rest of the staff there are friendly and are excellent about answering any questions and keeping you at ease in the dental chair. Dr. Vega and his staff's strengths have an outstanding ability to remain unflappable during procedures. I was incredibly impressed when Dr. Vega did a root canal resection on me at his previous practice. Dr. Sauls & Dr. Vega form one of the better tandems of dentistry in the Commonwealth and the Madison area should feel extremely lucky to have not only two outstanding people--but outstanding dentists as well. I'd recommend Dr. Vega to my own family--and I actually have. I've got nothing but fantastic things to say about the staff and I will be a Madison Family Dentistry patient as long as I can find employment in the Charlottesville area for the remainder of my life.

First, my insurance was filed differently than my previous dentist and my husbands dentist did.  My medical insurance was filed against.  I was quoted that I would pay $35 for the procedure.  The bill was more like $135.  The billing lady called me multiple times about insurance rather than handling it while I was in the office.  I work during the day.  I can\u2019t sit on the phone and wait for someone to figure this out.  I had a procedure done on the  left side of my mouth on a Monday and the following Monday I was scheduled for more work on the right  side.  I experienced some tooth sensitivity after the first procedure which was a normal side effect.  However by Monday (next procedure due), I was still having sensitivity.  I couldn\u2019t have the right side worked on while I still couldn\u2019t chew food on the left side.  I called to reschedule the appointment Monday morning first thing.  I left voicemail never was responded to and finally after 4 calls got the receptionist on the phone.    I was told I would have a $50 fee for canceling the appointment with less than 24 hours notice.  I didn\u2019t cancel the Friday before because I hoped the sensitivity would be gone by my appointment on Monday.  There is no way to cancel a Monday appointment on Saturday or Sunday.  I said go ahead and bill me if that\u2019s your policy.  Then the receptionist without consulting a dentist tried to bully me into coming to the office.  I didn\u2019t want to come in get billed for an office visit for them to look into something that is a normal side effect.  I finally had to say just bill me the $50 and I\u2019ll find another office to fix the other issues to get her off the phone.  There\u2019s no telling what I will end up paying for the first procedure since it wasn\u2019t filed on my insurance correctly.  It is a shame that bad office staff ruins the experience with an excellent dentist.

Thankful my insurance company is investigating this and allowed me another cleaning appointment with another dentist next week. I hope the next dentist will prove their scam that my teeth were never cleaned!

By way of x-rays and gum probings, we determine the  oral health of all patients that visit our office. Based on these findings, we then give a written diagnosis and proposed treatment for the patients to sign .\nWe have great working relationships with our patients as well as the insurance companies due to this protocol.

If I could give no stars I would. I have never been to a place that was  unprofessional as this one. The doctor that was working when I went the 1st time is no longer available and they did not even tell me , I had to ask. I made an appointment to get a crown. They said that it was fine. Remember I had previously been to this establishment. I also requested to have a cleaning but was told that I could not get both done at the same time. As soon as I get there I was already upset, they told me that they had to look at my tooth first and than proceed. I was under the impression that I was getting a crown, no one told me this over the phone and I know I needed one because it hurt and I was ready to pay for one. Instead they cleaned by teeth and looked in my mouth and told me what I needed. I let them contact (LHI) because I am in the military and they would cover some of the cost. LHI contacted me and told me they would NOT ALLOW balmoral dental to do any treatment; which should of been a red flag but I still needed my crown and would use different insurance to do it.  They gave me a cleaning and they scheduled me a another date to get a crown. I went to my appointment and I sat waiting for 20 minutes. I would of left because 10 to 15 minutes is enough time to wait and I was going to reschedule. I finally get in the back and I am talking with a entirely different doctor that has not seen me before. She looks on her screen and says you were here last year in March last and I was like no. What happened to my files. Clearly she did not know how to work her own computer because she did not click on the right date which I could see on the screen, than I told her what they did last time and she tells me I didn't talk with her so she does not have a clue what happened. SO I am really upset because there wasno communication between her and the other doctor. Than she explains to me whats going on and I told her that is not what happened and maybe she should communicate better because I was not going to pay for services that she didn't know what she was going to do, and on top of all that failure to tell me that they had to take measurements for my crown.  I asked why didn't they do this the last time. This was my last straw and will never ever go back to deal with this and hope no one has this issue.

He performed laser dentistry on her gums to give her a bigger smile, used the KOR whitening system to give her a bright white color to her teeth, and put on two new crowns that he gets from a lab in Hollywood, CA.

I scheduled my appointment with the dental rep and asked what I could expect. She told me to plan to be there about an hour. They would clean, polish and then give me the Sheer Whitening treatments. Wow, I thought, pretty good prize. I proceeded to ask what kind of whitening treatments they used, 5 day strips, ugh, I thought, oh well.\n\nUnfortunately, I arrived for my appointment about 10 minutes late, however, not intentional. The receptionist was a bit unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because I was late. Shortly, a dental assistant came to me with a clip board and 5 pages to fill out. I completed my basic information and soon realized they were wanting more info than was totally necessary to claim a prize. I began scanning over the pages and stopped immediately. They were asking me everything from signing to consent to pay for the charges they would render to me today and insurance could not be filed to authorizing them to obtain my dental records from my current dentist. I proceeded to the receptionist and told her there was obviously a mistake, I was asked to fill out patient paperwork and that I was only there to redeem my gift certificate. She told me to proceed completing the paperwork so that they could keep it on file. I looked at her in disbelief and sat back down placing the pen under the clip. I guess she signaled the assistant who came out and retrieved my paperwork. I waited for over 30 minutes before they called me back. I followed the assistant back to a dental room and she handed me a box of strips and about 5 minutes of instruction. Do you have any questions? I said, \"Are we done?\", she said yes that's it. Hmm, so they led me to believe that the cleaning and polishing were part of my prize when really they were going to bill me for this when they were finished. I guess I didn't fall for their trap. Talk about deceitful, a good reputable business does not do business this way. I will not be back. I will still use my strips, but could have got them at Wal-mart for $12.00. What a joke.

I'm not scared to go back.  Heck I'm kinda looking forward to it.  Can't wait to have a good smile and feel confident to show off my teeth again.  Oh and it was very very affordable.

Dr Kennedy and her hygienist, Stephanie worked me in for a quick X-ray & made me feel so at ease and comfortable. After discussing treatment plan I came back a week later  for a procedure. Dr Kennedy and her assistant again provided the utmost care and comfort making sure I was relaxed, free of pain, while enjoying the heated massage chair. I will recommend Dr Kennedy and her entire staff for your dental care. They have totally changed my fear and avoidance of the dentist. I wish I could give more than 5 stars because they exceed excellence in all areas.\nAlso, Dr Kennedy personally called/texted me the evening after my procedure to check on me.

I called on a Monday and received an appointment just two days later on Wednesday, February 11, 2021 at 2:00pm. I was there 30 minutes before my appointment and sent a text (as requested by the office) to let them know I was there.\n\nJada brought out the paperwork I needed to fill out as a new patient and requested I text the office phone number when finished. She took my insurance card and driver\u2019s license to make copies while I filled out the very simple paperwork. The paperwork was basic and took no time at all. I sent a message when I was ready.\n\nShannon was Dr. Rutledge\u2019s assistant. She did my X-ray where the toothache was and talked with me and about my dental history. I was comfortable with her immediately. She explained everything she was going to do before she did it.\n\nDr. Rutledge came in and was INCREDIBLE! He diagnosed what was wrong quickly. I was super surprised to find out I had a cracked tooth! He went over all options with me and we chose the best plan for me. My appointment with him was set up as a consultation only and I was afraid it would be a while before I could get in to have the work done he suggested but boy was I wrong!\n\nCasey is the wonderful lady who is in charge of checking out Dr Rutledge\u2019s patients and she set up my appointment for m, MONDAY, February 15, 2021! I only had to wait four days to have the work done! Casey is a ROCKSTAR!\n\nI will return on Monday, February 15, 2021 to have a crown and possible root canal. I\u2019m not nervous at all.

I was reluctant, because it wasn't giving me any pain or problems, but I had it replaced.  After the replacement, the dentist said he needed to replace his own work (no charge)  so he did.  Then I started having a lot of pain from the 2nd replacement.  He worked on it a 3rd time.  The last time I went in, he expressed that the whole tooth needed to be crowned - lest I eventually need a full root canal.

My son has been a patient at Deerfoot Dental since his teeth really started coming through. We left a message after hours and Dr. Grovestein called us back! He asked us to text him photos of my sons teeth. We sent the pics and he called us back. He reassured us that it probably wasn\u2019t as bad as it seems and he would meet us at his office the next morning. So he opened his clinic for us on his day off! I mean who does that? He gave us instructions to care for the tooth, we made a follow up appointment, and left. Needless to say..our sons tooth looks great. It actually straightened out almost back to its original spot. We went to our follow up appointment and got the good news that his teeth looked great and to just keep a watch on it.

I woke up one morning with a lot of pain and swelling. I went in and they gave me some antibiotics and ask I return to have the tooth fixed on completion of my antibiotics. The service from this visit was great!\nI returned on completion of my antibiotics and that's when the trouble started. They decided I needed to get a root canal on the tooth. It was still very sensitive and painful. The hygienist was very general when taking x-Rays and getting me into my room. The dentist came in and put a bit of numbing medication on my gums. The shot was done before the gum was numb and he started the dental work before the tooth was numb. He would not stop no matter what the hygentist or I did. I walked out of the office in tears and it wasn't until I got to my car the full effect of the numbing medication kicked in. The office staff and hygentist all seemed very upset about how the doctor did this.

From the moment you walk into the door or even a phone call you are instantly family. The doctors, is specially dr.
