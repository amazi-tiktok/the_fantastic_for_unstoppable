He was diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed Foxalin, which is Dexmethylphenidate. Its suppose to be a mild stimulant to the central nervous system that help control hyperactivity and impulse control. My grandson was only taking one dose in the morning to help him with hyperactivity and paying attention in school, his dosage was increase without proper assessment of the side effects of this controlled substance on a seven year old. After a day at the park with my grandson and my great nieces,while driving home my grandson tried to jump out of my car literally. I ran off the road while holden him with one hand hanging out my car and trying to whole the steering wheel with the other while my nieces yelled,we all could have been killed. When I did get off the road safely and got him back in the car he was asking me was I real,and was his cousins real. His heart was beating so fast I could see it through his shirt. When me and my daughter took him to Southeastern Pediatric to see his doctor she didn't seem to be concerned at all by this horrible event that me and my grandson and my nieces had experience. Her lack of sympathy or empathy for what had happen with my grandson due to the side effects of a controlled substance that she prescribed to a seven year old is beyond my comprehension. My grandsandson may just be another patient to her, but he means the world to me. I still think about what could have happen that day if I had lost my grip and he had fallen out my car. I give all my thinks to the Lord for saving me my grandson and my nieces, it's only by his Grace we are alive. My grandson is no longer on Focalin, and if I have anything to say about it he will never be put on another ADHD med.

They told her that it would cost 70.00... When I asked to speak to the young lady, (Amber or Amanda) she got on the phone and I asked how come they didn't give her an option to pay before she left.  This ______ said, \"We don't see ANY PATIENTS without them paying upfront... I let her know that MONEY was a problem however you just don't send a baby however when in fact they are suppose to be seen soon after coming out of the hospital... She then gave my grand daughter mother the phone back without saying anything...  I then told my grand daughters mother to leave because at this point I felt like we were taking my PUPPY to a veterinarian and not my grand daughter to a pediatrician... To me they made us feel like she was an un-necessary animal that we just wanted and not what we needed.  We will now do business in Columbus and not even worry about this Pediatric Center...

I started with dr. Stubblefield  and his nurse Erica. Both are absolutely wonderful and the reason I stayed so long. They care about your child interact with your child and really get to know your child. When Dr. Stubblefield left we stayed because of nurse Erica my baby loves her and the other staff although they treat you like \u201cjust another patient\u201d they were \u201cok\u201d. However my daughter medicaide expired the letter was sent to a old address I did not know until I was trying to make a appointment because she was sick. They actually refused to see her unless I payed cash up front. Now they know good and damn well medicaide would go back 3 months and pay that bill, if not bill me and I can pay it at a later date but at that time I just did not have it. Bottom line after 10 years you refuse my sick child over paperwork!!! Really???? They did not offer me any solution or try to work with me in any way they just did not care. So at this point it is time for us to move on and find a Dr. office that at least cares about their patients.\n\nUPDATE\nWe got the medicaide taken care of and started the process to change her Dr. In the process she ended up getting sick again. I had to make an appointment with this Dr. office one last time because she was not currently a patient at the new Dr. office. While I was there I wanted to get her medical records to kinda speed the transfer process along. When the African American receptionist (sorry I don\u2019t know her name) asked me what the problem was I explained. She was very apologetic and asked me if I could talk to I\u2019m guessing the offer manager. She as well as the rest of the staff was apologetic and she informed me it is against their policy to refuse a sick child and she wish I had to talk to her when this was going on.

The recording also stated the on call doc was at Jackson Hospital so I called and they put through to the same office I was just standing in. They put the nurse on the phone and she told me to come back to the office for treatment. I am very displeased with this office and if I didn't work 40 hours a week, I would stand outside their office with a sign that says \"Un-Professional Pediatrics! If you can find another office for your child, please do. Let this office be your last resort. The docs are nice but the front desk staff is awful and they set the atmosphere for your whole visit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a681ecc1ae3:0xbcc87ee2345c31fb"}

However, she no longer owns TFM and it seems like the greedy corporation take over has ruin what was once a great doctor's office.\n\nI showed to an appointment recently that was badly needed, as I had some concerns about me health including new issues. I had no prior contact with the office in any way before my appointment or was told nothing at previous visits. But money is what they wanted. I had no idea I had a bill, but the first thing they told me was \"you can't be seen today\" and then go on to tell me about the bill, which I offered to pay on, but I didn't have my cc with me at the time and offered to pay when I came back in a few days to get blood work results.\n\nThey gave their spiel about how doctors need to get paid too, and would I work without expecting to get paid, and blah blah blah. I' believe people deserve to get paid for good services. After all, I had been coming there for over 10 years and paid ever single bill prior, so why would anyone think I wouldn't pay this one. I've my own business before, I know it's important to get paid.  But shouldn't human decency and kindness be the first form of communication one starts with instead of the \"I want my money first\" attitude?\n\nFor me, I felt abandon by a doctor's office that I had been coming to for years. That I trusted my children with. I was given zero notice before being told I couldn't be seen. I was over due for certain treatments that I have to see the doctor or nurse to receive. I had concerns about my blood pressure and other issues that were important to prevent increased medical problems. I didn't want to hear their spew about \"working for free\" or we have to be paid to continue services, I wanted to hear. \"Ok, what can we do to help you out? We're here for you.\" Treat people like this first I guarantee you will always get paid.\n\nOr at the least I wanted the bare treatment until I had enough time to find another doctor for treatment, but I wasn't even given that. Yes, they offered to see me again, but made it clear I was going to have to jump through some hoops and pay, always with an emphasis on getting paid, never about what I thought doctors first priority was supposed to be: to do no harm an give their patients the best medical care they can ( not for free of course), but a good doctor put's people first. Dr. Burdette always did this, but this new corporation or whomever owns Taylorville Family Medicine now, IS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY AND COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT YOU.

Today I had an appointment scheduled with her that I had been waiting months for, my appointment was at 3:15pm at 3:00pm I received a text that said they were running behind and my new appointment time would be at 3:31pm and that they would text me again before my appointment to confirm. At 3:30pm I received the same text. I went ahead to the appointment because I needed to be seen and I would just wait in my car. When I went in and checked with the receptionist she told me that I was 45 minutes late and that they would have to reschedule my appointment. I showed her the texts and she said that they only sent the one text that was generated when I did not show up for my appointment at 3:15pm. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE!!!!  I was very upset, she told me that it would throw them completely behind to try and see me and that she talked to the owner and he said that I would have to reschedule. There was absolutely no one in the waiting room. While telling me this a woman walked in and said are you still open? She said yes and checked her in for bloodwork. But they can\u2019t admit their mistakes when it comes to texts that cause problems and let me be seen. They then sent one of the medical assistants out to talk to me. He was VERY RUDE AND CONDESCENDING, after telling me that I should have come and checked in at my appointment time he went on to tell me that he was always at least 15 minutes early for ever appointment he has ever scheduled. When I told him that was foolish for me to come and sit in a reception area for an undetermined amount of time in the middle of a pandemic-he told me I could have waited in my car. When I told him that I was working and felt that was ridiculous he told me that he was a single parent to 2 children whose mother had died and that he had to be both parents to his children and still keep his appointments and go to work everyday to support them. This all in a raised voice that apparently carried. When he finally stopped his tirade, or I could have possibly interrupted him to tell him that my husband passed away in 2012 and that I also have 2 children that I have had to raise myself while working and keeping appointments and yes I raised my voice too. At that point, the nursing staff came out and told me to leave and that the owner would call me. That I was upsetting the patients in the office. Really??? I have always been at my appointments, I have watched this office deteriorate over the last couple of years, I like Dr Burdette but it is clear from all the things that have happened and from the way they have treated me (and others if you read the google reviews and not all the five star reviews they have on there site which I am positive they solicit and approve) that Dr Burdette has absolutely no control over what happens with her patients. I am certain that the owner will never call me and if he does it will probably be to tell me not to come back. Which he doesn\u2019t need to do because I will not be treated like that and will find another doctor. One that actually cares about the needs of their patients and does not treat them like they treated me today. I am extremely disappointed in Dr Burdette, I feel like after 10 years she should have at the very least - have talked to me herself, but she did not, I feel very sad that she cared so little for me as her patient but I guess I just misjudged her as well. This is not the first problem I have had with them but it will be the last. The NP\u2019s there miss a lot of things and you almost never see Dr Burdette unless you specifically ask to and then things like this happen. I expect them to not release my records without a fight also. Please think before you make an appointment here and please don\u2019t put yourself in risk if you feel that you are not getting the care you need and deserve at this or any of their clinics. I will be reporting all of what happened to me today to my insurance company and to the state medical board.

Instead of this \u201c Nurse Practioner\u201d listening to the severity of my symptoms and etc she wrote me for a med, said this is for anxiety and just as good as the Xanax....

When try to talk to her all she done was smirked and showed no interest of the severity of my problem!!! That\u2019s how people end up dead so to suicide a lot of times is bc no one cares, starting with healthcare! I begged her to please go speak with the Dr a quick sec for me bc for me, yes it was an emergency but no. U will have to schedule make another copay and so on.

OT, PT, Speech etc etc. all the doctors fax his physician so he can fill them out. Never had a problem, in the beginning. Called spoke directly to his nurse and had stuff done fast and efficiently. This is the only reason we see him. But in 2018, suddenly it is $10 for him to fill out forms. Hmmm...little double dipping.....they told me I could make another appointment and he could fill them out then. really??? So pay you a copay, then you get paid by my insurance for the visit....or pay you to sign your name (because all is already filled out) to each page for 10 a page.\nAnother weird charge. We had an emergency (death in the family) and had to leave for FL. Didn\u2019t even realize till we got back that our daughter had one pill left of her medicine. Called and left a message (cause getting someone on the phone is a worse chances than the lotto) about this. Low and behold two hours later they call and say that it will be $20 to do rush and pick the RX up today. Seriously??? A medicine she has to take everyday to function, that events out of my hand happened and they tell me this. This office is all about money. I\u2019ve never had an office charge something like this. I can understand missed appointment fees. But a rush fee?? Fill\nOut form fees....a performance that is part of your job? Seriously??

I asked if I could make an appointment for the next day seeing that they could see her condition, but was told no that I had to call back after 9am which would mean another day from work and her being out of school. The lady at the counter said \"We do this because sometimes the child will feel better the next day and the parent would cancel the appointment.\" I am thinking so what? I am sure they are not lacking in patients. But she saw my child with blotches on her face and arms and hands and could see that it was not going away over night.

The place was disgusting. The floors and chairs were smeared in god knows what and their wasn't a hand sanitizer station visible in the place.  Upon intake my child was given a large dose of Tylenol (even though i had just given him some 2 hours before) the dose was 3.75 ml even though our sheet from pediatrician says weight gets 2.5ml. and he was given a dose of Benadryl and we were sent back to waiting room. After an hour or so we were taken to a room where the billing representative came immediately to collect my 100 copay and then an hour later we saw a resident who snottily corrected me when i called him a nurse. He asked some questions looked him over and left. I didn't see anyone again for hours. I was by myself, my child is an infant and i needed to use the bathroom. the only one was in the hall. The bed had no rails to leave my baby in, there was no nurse visible or that answered the call button to assist and the bathroom had no table to lay him on so i could use the bathroom. After a few hours the doctor comes in with a nurse and informs me that my child is allergic to tape (where they taped his eyes down for surgery that morning) and he has sensitive skin. And that they were going to give him a dose of Benadryl to help the swelling. I said NO you just gave him Benadryl on intake and a very large dose of Tylenol. They were like oh we did? Sorry.. I pointed out that the Benadryl did not help and his eye is looking progressively worse and that if he was allergic to tape wouldn't both eyes be like this?  They informed me they weren't going to do anything or run any tests and to follow-up with regular doctor tomorrow. They would however do a flu test to appease me. I know he doesn't have the flu and after 30 minutes i paged the nurse to ask if we can go home and have the flu results called to doctor the next morning? They said they will tell the nurse and send her in to talk to us. Never showed up. Flash forward another hour and 45 minutes. Flu negative and we can finally go home. Vitals and temp never checked since intake and no bloodwork drawn. Nothing. The next morning my child breaks out in the roseola rash. Thanks for nothing Children's.

I don't want to ever in my Life step back into this ER as long as I'm breathing because I work in Healthcare as well & our Mission is to always make sure the patient is taken care of. Nurse was Great! Check-in Great! Wait was Ok! The Escort to the room was Great with a Smile! The Patient Coordinator was Great! Dr. Anna White is Horrible & I will write & call Patient Advocate to complain.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb82e602809:0xf4200c41f2c591b6"}

Front desk staff are friendly, helpful, and courteous. Water fountains and restrooms are quite clean (even to a neat freak like me), and separate wait areas are offered (and enforced in a nice way) for sick visits, well visits, and even a newborn waiting area.\nOverall we could not be more pleased with our experience, and it seemed obvious to both myself and my husband that Dr. Johnson followed a true calling to become a fantastic pediatrician.

(Eastern Shore). I love the dr's and the staff. My biggest issue is the disorganization and lack of training to staff who sets appointments. I used to go to the Fairhope location about 35 minute drive from my house because I was new to the area and was unaware of their Spanish Fort location. Over a year ago I had shown up to the Fairhope location like so many times before and they said they accidentally set my appointment up at the spanish fort location. I was one frustrated because I had not taken enough time off work to drive in circles nor could I miss the appointment. But I was happy to know there was one only 5 miles from my house! So I started going to that location for the remainder of the year. I thought I had made the error and called the wrong location and didnt think anything of it until yesterday I called at 8am when they opened and needed to make a same day appointment for my daughter who fell very ill. I googled the clinic and called the Spanish Fort office by the phone number listed to the location I wanted to set my appt with. (little did I know they do not have separate phone lines!!! so please PLLLLEASE PLEASE beware when your setting your appt!!!) . She told me she could get me in at 210 and I happily accepted the appointment.\nSHE NEVERRRRR mentioned this was an appointment for Fairhope, nor did she say \"which location would you like to set your appointment for\". I think if they are going to have 1 receptionist for both locations this is soooo CRUCIAL!!! It is a huge disrespect for peoples times! I thought I was only taking 1 hour off work to run my daughter 5 miles from my house, but it ended up being a 3 hour venture!\nI was scheduled to get my windshield wipers fixed after the drs appointment right by their clinic and was not prepared to drive very far. (and I ended up missing my car repair appointment!) My windshield wipers had broke. So I had to drive 40 minutes in a huge down pour shaking and crying because I was so scared and unprepared to drive in a heavy down pour, but it was also crucial my daughter was seen and didnt miss her appointment. Had the receptionist been trained to advise ALL CALLERS that they have 2 locations I would have set my appointment up for my windshield wiper repair before the drs appointment so my daughter and I could safely travel to our destination. So since the receptionist is not trained to advise callers that she sets appointments up for both locations and needs to confirm which location your setting your appointment for then please please please do her job for her and ask her where is she setting your appointment up for. Though I did tell her I love her Spanish Fort location and she disregarded that, I feel it maybe crucial to make sure you have her repeat the appointment location more then once to be on the safe side and to save you over an hour driving back and forth to the two seperate locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6821aca248df:0x7d06818a147feba9"}

I tried our primary care provider first who didn\u2019t have any openings that afternoon and upon their referral I called Urgent Care for Children on 280.  I was informed I could be a walk in our schedule an appointment time online so I opted to schedule a time because general that means you don\u2019t have to wait as long.  I arrived for my daughter\u2019s appointment early to complete any necessary paperwork since we\u2019d not been there before.  I signed in told reception we had an appointment he looked and confirmed but then said this: \u201cI know you have an appointment but....\u201d. Wait what?  Why would you say that to a mom, who took the time to fill the forms in online and make an appointment?  \u201cI know you have an appointment but\u201d there is a walk in, \ud83e\udd14 yes there is but I made an appointment for which I showed up on time.  So NO, it is not acceptable to say this to a mom and who has a kid with fever in your waiting room with who know what the others in the waiting room have.  We are in the middle of flu season and multiple other viruses and I made an appointment and those with an appointment come first especially when I walked in at the same time as said \u201cwalk-ins\u201d.  Needless to say he was not apologetic for dismissing the fact I called ahead and made an appointment and came at that time.  And for that I would give 1 \u2b50\ufe0f, the nurse and Nurse practitioner were what drove the rating up.  They were pleasant and helpful, my daughter thankfully only had a virus so we didn\u2019t end up with meds and thankfully nothing else she may have been exposed to by not being taken back when she should have been.  But that\u2019s my rating for all it\u2019s worth.

They answered all of our questions and truly gave us the best care we couldn've asked for! The facility was very clean and the receptionist and nurses were all very kind. We are in town visiting family for the holidays, but we will definitely go back if ever the boys come down with anything again while visiting the area.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1515030158837, "text": "Thanks for the review.

It was so wonderful to find an urgent care facility that is strictly for children! Many ER\u2019s are ill equipped to deal with children so it was so reassuring to know we\u2019d be seeing a Dr whose primary focus was pediatrics. The waiting room was very clean & colorful, it had two big screen TVs with children\u2019s programs playing, smaller tables and chairs for the children, and well lit with large windows. The receptionist was extremely helpful and kind (which is rare these days) and answered each and every question I had enthusiastically,and not as though I was an intrusion on her time. She offered a pack of goldfish crackers and Gatorade to my grandson & I noticed many other varieties of snacks and even pedia-Light that was available for the waiting patients. Including check in, paperwork, & waiting to be seen we sat maybe 15 minutes total. An added plus was they informed us that my grandsons records for his visit that day would be faxed to his regular pediatrician in our hometown so they\u2019d be aware of his visit. The nurse who called us back and took vitals was very kind and gentle and listened to all our concerns without interrupting. The physician we saw was very informative and thorough and answered each and every question slowly and completely. They have a lab on site so we were able to confirm, during our visit, that he had the flu. It was very nice that all paperwork and co-pays were done beforehand so we could leave immediately following the examination. I highly recommend this facility and hope they continue to offer the same service in the future.

Upon arrival there was no one at the front desk. I had to ring the bell and wait several minutes until I actually saw a worker. Once a worker finally appeared she asked us to sign in and have a sit. She came back and got us checked in. We waited to be called back. Once we were  called back we sat in the exam room for over an hour. No one ever came back to check on us. I stuck my head out the door to see the nurse/front desk receptionist had left to get what look like a prescription & was just returning. She told us the physician would be in shortly, but that never happened. We ended up leaving without being seen. Common courtesy is everything. If a patient has been waiting for awhile it doesn't hurt to check in on them from time time. It helps with letting them know they haven't been forgotten.\nSigned,\nA disappointed mom", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539710490183, "text": "We\u2019re sorry to hear that you had a less than positive experience during your last visit to our Trussville location, Johnisha.

I was out of their door by 11:20!! And while everyone made sure to move through what had to be done efficiently and quickly, I did not feel rushed and or that they didn't answer my questions. I recommended this office to anyone that is looking for a primary care doctor!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888912c54dfad43d:0xc9fcfdecc2c57596"}

I will never go back again and I urge you not to either, From one mother to another, its a very sad feeling to have your little one in your arms asking for help from the doctor and he look you right in the face and say no their doctors will not see you because you transferred your records; you are no longer part of this group, so go to ER.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c92c8950f73c1:0x1e788289b0d4f6c1"}

I was a patient in this practice with Dr. Cochran since birth. When I had my two children, they began seeing Dr. Klemm. I have not had an issue until recently. Their father and I are divorced, so the kids are on his insurance. Last year, one of their policies was showing two plans for my daughter, so Tricare wouldn\u2019t pay due to them requesting OHI, but there was not another plan in existence to give info to them. There was an outstanding balance due to this. I personally called the billing department multiple times. Each time, I was assured a note was placed on the account. Their father was deployed, so I had to call the insurance companies trying to resolve. Since I was not his wife, it was required for him to speak regarding this. I gave all notices and information to their father as well as HPA billing. He stated that he also called and spoke to the billing department at HPA regarding the situation at hand. Yesterday, I called HPA to make a sick child appointment for my daughter. She has been treated with allergy drops by an allergist, so this was the first time in over a year we\u2019ve had to make an office visit. I was transferred to the billing department after making the appointment. The lady, Evelyn, stated that if the balance was not paid in full by the end of her appointment, a dismissal letter would be issued to Dr. Klemm, releasing both of my children from the practice. I questioned hadn\u2019t their father contacted regarding the matter, because I was notified he had. She showed no care whatsoever. When we arrived for the appointment, I paid the balance in full. I requested and received a copy of my check showing the payment was made. Not even an hour and a half later, I received a hasty voicemail from Evelyn stating that she saw where we did not pay the balance, so she had discussed with Dr. Klemm the situation, and he would be signing the dismissal letter, and the decision would be final. I immediately called back when I received the message, but Evelyn was out to lunch. The lady I spoke to on the phone was very kind. She apologized and assured me, she would take matter into her own hands and remove the dismissal letter. She stated checks stay downstairs at the front office until Monday morning, so that\u2019s where the disconnect came in due to them having a new system, and this balance was from the \u201cold\u201d system. I called back over an hour later requesting to speak to Evelyn. I was placed on hold for a matter of time, and the kind lady returned to the phone, apologizing that she hadn\u2019t told her in person the payment was made, but now she had, and everything was taken care of. It\u2019s very unfortunate to experience this, as I feel the need to find care elsewhere for my children if possible due to this situation. If in the future insurance has an issue again, and the billing department will not step in to resolve or give any guidance in a resolution, will this happen yet again? Just know, if you choose this practice, stay on them about having the correct insurance information. After visits, I would follow up to ensure the claims were filed correctly, and there is no balance. If there is a balance, request every piece of information to ensure it truly is an expense to you, and not an oversight for an insurance issue.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ca5e803629f:0x490049feb8aaf8ff"}

Huntsville Pediatrics Associates was a recommended doctor group by some of my neighbors.  After multiple phone calls to the staff inquiring how to get my family in their care and some technical difficultly filling out the online application (it took me four hours to get this done because of compatibility issues), I was able to submit my application.  The issue I have is after multiple phone calls to the staff, not once did anyone indicate the patient list may be full.  I spent hours completing their requirements, only to be informed that I would not be accepted and could try again next month if I desired. I understand being full, but why waste my time.  I spoke with Kerrie, the new patient coordinator, who was extremely polite and seemed sympathetic to my predicament, but was left with no options.  I believe everything happens for a reason, but if it is this process driven and cumbersome just to try and become a patient, how difficult is it to get an appointment or try to settle an insurance claim?  Feeling a bit frustrated and dissatisfied with the level of misinformation associated with this practice.  The two star rating is for Kerrie.  She was the only bright spot in the entire experience.

I have 45 more min. 30 min later I go and ask her why they cant just notify people when the doc is this far behind for which she had a sarcastic answer, Can I come back tomorrow?\nThe nurse comes out huffy and takes me behind the door of the waiting room. I proceed to ask. Where else besides the Doctor is it acceptable to wait over an hour with no explaination?? Well the Doctor is running behind what could we do about it??blah blah I got very condescending with suggestions and passionately expressed my dissaproval for not just letting me come back another day the first time I asked. blah blah Come back tomorrow morning.\nI knew things might be icy, but I was told that I hurt the nurses feelings and I explained my side of the story calmly. The doc says she agrees with some of my suggestions and maybe they could explore some technological solutions. I express to her that I was never upset because they were behind but the total lack of consideration for my responsibilities I had that day and the poor conflict management skills.\nNow my poor 11 year old child who has no dog in this race is forced to make a new relationship with a physician right at puberty  because I had a bad day and lost my temper and talked down to the nurse!!!\nNo conversation, No phone call, A certified letter!!

It\u2019s split into two sections, one side for family care the other for pediatrics. I appreciate that there\u2019s a sick area and a well area with toys for the children to play with while waiting. I also appreciate that there\u2019s a tv with cable for the sick ones to stay entertained. The pediatric patient rooms are decorated in cute themes and have toys for the kids. But the buck stops there for me.\n\nDr. Shrestha didn\u2019t have the bedside manner I would expect with kids. I brought my 8 year old in for an issue and the way she spoke with her was as if she was very limited on patience, and almost as if she was scolding her. My daughter picked up on this and didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to her the rest of the time.\n\nBringing my one year old in for her \u201cone year bloodwork\u201d was fine as well. Until they stuck my baby in her arms 2 times and started to go for her feet until my husband told them \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Finally, with one more stick (that\u2019s totaling 3 now) they got the blood they needed and my baby has since been terrified of any medical personnel.\n\nSince we weren\u2019t happy with the office my husband and I have transferred care to HPA, where so far we are happy. I\u2019ve sent over HPAs medical release form for both of my children two times now. The first time I was told \u201cYou have to use our release form.\u201d No. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m required to use a HIPAA compliant medical release form (which HPAs form is) and you are required to release my records to the designated party. This was in February. Here we are at the second week of April and HPA STILL has not received my kids records. Now, my blue card is expired and the best part is there\u2019s mass confusion between the two offices on what shots are due to my 19 month old. The two offices have different shot schedules and we can\u2019t get PCPFM to send records to HPA so we can figure out what to do!\n\nI\u2019m SEVERELY annoyed and disappointed in how inefficiently this office is ran and the incompetence of the staff there. I\u2019ve done my my part. I\u2019ve crossed my T\u2019s and dotted my I\u2019s, so what\u2019s the issue?\n\nIf you are considering this place or this physician to see your kids I have one word of advice.

Dr. Levin and Dr. Stansell have been seeing my children since birth and they are all teenagers now. The doctors are very professional and the nurses are as well. I have had nothing but excellent service since I first came to this practice with my first child who is now 18. I highly recommend this pediatric practice. They work to schedule you in and also will accomodate on Saturdays if needed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919795f05354d:0xe92408786cde6f95"}
{"user_id": "114052527881829073403", "name": "Charity Moore", "time": 1547814735270, "rating": 1.0, "text": "I brought my son in for wheezing several times in the past year and always left with the diagnosis of RSV (despite only being tested once and not being in daycare). He's not 2 years old yet, but with frequent respiratory infections, an extensive family history, seasonal allergies and sleep apnea that required surgery, I knew he had asthma which he was refused treatment for because of his age. I called the office on December 12th for a referral to a pulmonologist because this round of difficulty breathing and wheezing was taking fairly long for him to recover from. It is now January 18th and I have yet to receive a phone call, letter in the mail, postcard, telegram, pigeon carrier, a follow-up phone call ANYTHING in regards to the requested referral OR any concern for my child's inability to breathe properly. I received a phone call that Dr. Albert wouldn't be available for his 2yr appointment and was asked if I needed to reschedule, when I expressed my concern about the service I received (or lack thereof), the nurse informed me she'd \"look into what happened\" to see why no one had called me back. That was Wednesday. It's now Friday and no one has reached out to me. Luckily enough, I had scheduled an appointment for Alabama Asthma and Allergy and got a confirmed asthma diagnosis with daily treatment, a rescue inhaler and a nebulizer to treat his frequent RSV in the month I waited for that referral. I will be calling the medical board to seek answers as to why his symptoms were ignored despite his documented medical history. There's also special cause for concern that with his premature birth, he was administered vaccinations that would increase his likelihood of developing respiratory infections. None of the staff discussed that or the possibility that he may be immunocompromised due to his prematurity and frequent respiratory problems. There was no information provided on the vaccinations he received in order for me to provide informed consent. It wasn't until after speaking with the doctor at Alabama Allergy that this information was presented to me or even discussed. Take your children elsewhere as this staff shows little to no concern over whether or not your child can breathe.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919795f05354d:0xe92408786cde6f95"}
