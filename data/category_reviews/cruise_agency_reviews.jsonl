Imagine my surprise, when we fished with Captain Dan aboard the Explorer. What a difference! The Captain put us on fish, and knew when and where to move to keep the action consistent, and stayed out a bit longer than planned to ensure everyone had a good shot at a catch. The crew, from First mate Jason to Julie, Steve, and Ashton, the entire team was first rate. They were fun, lively, VERY helpful and worked hard to keep lines in the water and made sure everyone was attended to, with bait, and fish removal as well as quickly fixing tangles, and kept everyone fishing.\nBy far the hardest working, and most attentive crew in Party boat fishing.!!

As we walked up the stairway to the upper deck to view the dolphins there were no benches or any permanent seating just the cheap white lawn chairs you buy at Dollar General. This not such a big deal but very in professional looking. Second of All as soon as we sit down in our lawn chair we noticed there were way to many people on the upper deck for the amount of chars provided. This was due to the lower deck witch is enclosed and air conditioned smelling like raw sewege. We not talking about a little stick, it was so bad not one person could stay inside and by the end of the trip the smell was leaking out of the lower deck and was ingulfing us on the stairway outside on the boat.This was my chief complaint just due to the fact I have 3 small children that use the bathroom a lot and I was having to go in and out of this stink a lot!! Also could have seen more dolphins from the beach and we had got a lot more close to the dolphins the day before fishing. It was hour into the trip before we seen a dolphin 200yds away.

There was ample food for everyone!\n\nChicken, pork, salad, mashed potatoes, pasta, grilled vegetables, dinner rolls and strawberry bread pudding!  There is a bar onboard and you can enjoy an alcoholic beverage with your lunch.\n\nCompliments to Chef Jonathan!  Two thumbs up!\n\nIt was a very smooth ride and we enjoyed seeing the sights!\n\nThe Staff is very professional and polite and assisted the passengers boarding and departing the Perdido Queen.\n\nWe will recommend the Perdido Queen to our American Snowbird friends!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1530358719294, "text": "Thank you for cruising with Hudson Marina!

Took us to the end of the bay and said he wasn\u2019t going any further because of waves. We literally sat there and watched other dolphin boats pass us to go out. Saw two dolphins fins. That was it. Paid $60 for 4 people for nothing. After tour, spoke with captain about how disappointed I was. He didn\u2019t care. Called and spoke to manager and they were rude to me. Waste of time.
