Donna Crossley uses a procedure that I not had before and it is phenomenal.  If you have had electrolysis before or have never tried it but need something to help with unwanted hair, I highly recommend Skin Deep Electrolysis.  You will be so happy, and hopeful, if you do.  Donna will explain the entire process thoroughly with you.  Explaining the difference from other forms of electrolysis with what she uses. I have even found the blend method to be less painful than what I have been having.  This past summer I had to look for another Electrolysis.  I did not know Skin Deep Electrolysis was here in Madison.  In October it had been four months since my last electrolysis session and at that point I was getting so very desperate.  The growth of hair was causing extreme stress that I thought I was going to have to resort to shaving.  Then I was told of Skin Deep Electrolysis.  There has been such a turn around for me and my facial hair problem.  I will forever be grateful I was guided here. Thank you Donna for what you have done for me and just understanding.

I am also a fellow Electrologyst, and I am very picky on who I let work on my body! I trust Donna completely!!! We drive back-and-forth many hours to work on each other, and she has always been a blessing to me! Donna goes far beyond any Electrologyst I\u2019ve ever met in being clean and sanitary! She uses only the best equipment to make sure everything is clean and safe. She is also an RN, so her medical knowledge in how the body works, along with her desire to understand all the equipment, every probe, every wire, and how everything functions with your hair growth system is absolutely Amazing!!! She teaches me more and more each day as a coworker, as a client, and as a friend. I highly recommend Donna at Skin Deep Electrolosys to everyone in the Huntsville area!!! You won\u2019t find anyone who cares about your skin and hair removal needs like she does.

The business is clean, pretty, and comforting. The chair that I sit in as she's working her magic is super comfortable, her equipment is top quality, and I love the music she plays.. so relaxing. Donna is super sweet and extremely knowledgeable about everything electrolysis and skin care!\n\n(fyi.. I used to go to a DIFFERENT electrologist in Franklin, TN who basically robbed me of my time and money. That other lady was super rude, and almost made me lose hope.. She wasn't very knowledgeable about what she was doing. Her technique did nothing for me; the hairs would grow back in a few days... So be careful, not all electrologists are legit!! Or at least she wasn't for me)\n\nDonna, however, has given me hope back that I can get this hirsutism finally under control. The technique that Donna uses works! It kills the hairs, and it takes quite some time for new hairs from the new cycles to appear. And when they do, I can tell that there is already less. She is lgbt+ friendly, and also knows quite alot about PCOS, so don't be afraid to reach out to her business if you're looking to kill some hairss!!\n\nI'm so extremely grateful that I found Skin Deep Electrolysis!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581992723939, "text": "Thank you Martina.
