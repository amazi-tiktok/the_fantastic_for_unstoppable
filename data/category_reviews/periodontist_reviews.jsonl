Because of this my pain threshold is high so if I say something hurts it really hurts. My previous dental office was aware of this yet the hygienist chose to ignore the pain I was experiencing. After speaking with the office manager I decided I would not complete my appointment and later called back and canceled any further treatment with that practice. I called my insurance company and located the office of a previous dentist that I loved and I am so glad I did. I called Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace and even the interaction over the phone was pleasant. Whitney was able to schedule me an appointment quickly and educated me on the processes and procedures and what to expect. I could hear her smile through the phone. The day of my appointment, the entire staff was absolutely wonderful! As a new patient for the practice I knew I would have paperwork and would probably be there for a while but as soon as I finished my paperwork my hygienist was waiting for me. Chelsey greeted me with smiling eyes (she had on her mask), explained the process in depth and after reviewing my x-rays she recommended the best next step to help with my issues. She listened and made sure to understand what I was experiencing and throughout my appointment she made sure the process was not causing too much pain. With tender swollen gums pain is to be expected however if the hygienist knows what they are doing the patient will experience minimal pain. Chelsey knows what she is doing! She took a potentially mouth throbbing, tears running uncomfortable situation and made it a pleasant and educational experience. I went in with my mouth feeling awful and because of what Chelsey did my teeth feel so much better. Because I am a cancer warrior my teeth and gums have gone through some major changes. Chemo, radiation and long term medication has caused damage that I thought was going to take radical treatment to repair but Chelsey explained how to minimize further damage and what to do to get me on a path of recovery. She was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace, you will not be disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621012488256, "text": "Wow to that wonderful review!

They use Transworld System collection agency when Tonya makes a mistake with your treatment plan and tells you your insurance will pay half and you pay the other half ($560) and then it turns out TONYA read it wrong but expects the patient to pay for her mistake you will get turned over to a collection agency! I liked Dr. Bentley and was very disappointed she let her office manager get away with dirty office practices, so I had no other choice but to find another dentist for my son and I. Tonya wouldn\u2019t let me speak to Dr. Bentley she twisted what happened to fit her narrative and let Dr.Bentley think they were doing me a favor by cutting the bill in half when all along Tonya knows this is on her! And she sent a $240 bill to collections on a procedure that wasn\u2019t even done correctly (we were told my son didn\u2019t need a crown turns out he did but because of Tonyas error reading our policy which is her job by the way we never went back to Dr.Bentley after getting a $500 bill in the mail no phone call Tonya knew I would be upset and she knew exactly what she told me) and the tooth had to be extracted after all of that! So NO  I do not recommend you go there! Not because of Dr. Bentley but because you cannot trust Tonya to do your insurance and billing correctly! Do you have an extra $1000.00  laying around when you get a surprise bill from Tonya? When I asked Tonya why she didn\u2019t catch that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover that procedure she said to me well neither did you! Wow!! Tonya claimed to have gotten an approval for the procedure when all along root canals weren\u2019t covered within the first year of coverage (so that was a lie to cover her mistake) I would have thought an office manager and the person who is supposed to verify insurance would check that first thing!

It's a partnership where we rely on what the insurance provides us and what the insurance provides to the patient about their own coverage.

They followed all safety measures against COVID and I felt very safe. Dr. Lane has a great chairside manner. Very caring and does not rush his exams. He makes recommendations and provides advice on maintaining healthy gums. My hygienist, Kathy, does a terrific job in analyzing my gum health and cleaning my teeth. She does an extensive cleaning and ensures I am comfortable. Staff is friendly and personable. Insurance filings with my primary and secondary insurance usually go without a hitch. If there is an issue, they work hard to resolve. They are good enough to file for me even though they are not a preferred provider with my primary insurance. I hope this helps in making your decision to see Dr. Lane and his staff.\nMy initial review: Dr. Lane resolved my gum issues. Very personable and not rushed. Answers all questions to my satisfaction.

From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeting with compassion and understanding, and assured that they could fix her crowns.  They immediately scheduled an appoint for that same week to do her evaluation.  In that first appointment, Dr. Wilson laid out exactly what needed to be done, gave us a time frame for the work to be completed with cost estimates, and hand made her a set of temporaries that looked better than any of the final crowns from the other dentists we had worked with.  He performed laser dentistry on her gums to give her a bigger smile, used the KOR whitening system to give her a bright white color to her teeth, and put on two new crowns that he gets from a lab in Hollywood, CA.  I can proudly say today that my wife has a beautiful smile that she is so proud of thanks to the work of Dr. Wilson and his staff at Signature Smiles.

I scheduled my appointment with the dental rep and asked what I could expect. She told me to plan to be there about an hour. They would clean, polish and then give me the Sheer Whitening treatments. Wow, I thought, pretty good prize. I proceeded to ask what kind of whitening treatments they used, 5 day strips, ugh, I thought, oh well.\n\nUnfortunately, I arrived for my appointment about 10 minutes late, however, not intentional. The receptionist was a bit unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because I was late. Shortly, a dental assistant came to me with a clip board and 5 pages to fill out. I completed my basic information and soon realized they were wanting more info than was totally necessary to claim a prize. I began scanning over the pages and stopped immediately. They were asking me everything from signing to consent to pay for the charges they would render to me today and insurance could not be filed to authorizing them to obtain my dental records from my current dentist. I proceeded to the receptionist and told her there was obviously a mistake, I was asked to fill out patient paperwork and that I was only there to redeem my gift certificate. She told me to proceed completing the paperwork so that they could keep it on file. I looked at her in disbelief and sat back down placing the pen under the clip. I guess she signaled the assistant who came out and retrieved my paperwork. I waited for over 30 minutes before they called me back. I followed the assistant back to a dental room and she handed me a box of strips and about 5 minutes of instruction. Do you have any questions? I said, \"Are we done?\", she said yes that's it. Hmm, so they led me to believe that the cleaning and polishing were part of my prize when really they were going to bill me for this when they were finished. I guess I didn't fall for their trap. Talk about deceitful, a good reputable business does not do business this way. I will not be back. I will still use my strips, but could have got them at Wal-mart for $12.00. What a joke.

I woke up one morning with a lot of pain and swelling. I went in and they gave me some antibiotics and ask I return to have the tooth fixed on completion of my antibiotics. The service from this visit was great!\nI returned on completion of my antibiotics and that's when the trouble started. They decided I needed to get a root canal on the tooth. It was still very sensitive and painful. The hygienist was very general when taking x-Rays and getting me into my room. The dentist came in and put a bit of numbing medication on my gums. The shot was done before the gum was numb and he started the dental work before the tooth was numb. He would not stop no matter what the hygentist or I did. I walked out of the office in tears and it wasn't until I got to my car the full effect of the numbing medication kicked in. The office staff and hygentist all seemed very upset about how the doctor did this. Needless to say I did not return to have my permanent crown done at this office and for purposes of all emergencies will seek care elsewhere!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83398ccf29f:0x3b4520c933b799fb"}
