Bree and the team here give: 1) true up front, out the door pricing, 2) a fair amount for trades, 3) no hassle financing and 4) great service all the way around. We appreciated the honesty she gave us from the get go knowing we had been working with another dealership. She never bad mouthed them or tried anything sneaky (can\u2019t say the same for the Big #1) to win our business. She beat them in price and overall customer service. Casey, in finance, was able to get us a deal we could work with, warranties and services we needed and our financing approved quickly. When we arrived everything, to include our bike, was ready to go. When parts we were expecting were not immediately found, Tim, the General Manager, stepped in and started looking and found the part.
