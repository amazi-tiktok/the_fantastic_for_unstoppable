I finally decided I was getting no where on my own and scheduled an appointment. His staff is so friendly and helpful. They were able to work me in fairly quick. I was impressed with their office, their no wait policy and how friendly everyone was. He used ART on my hip, glutes and legs. It took about 4 weeks of visits, but he finally got me back to running.

After finding his contact information on the A.R.T. providers page, I decided to schedule an appointment.  I was initially hesitant, as I live in Pensacola and would need to drive almost an hour to get to Fairhope.  I can say that each and every trip I make down for an appointment is absolutely worth it.  Unlike other practitioners that I've seen, Dr. Justin took the time to listen to my concerns and give me feedback.  I didn't feel like another patient on the assembly line.\n\nI was also impressed with his ability to provide me with some immediate relief.  Using A.R.T., Dr. Justin was able to help me alleviate some nagging hip flexor pain, and also give me more range of motion in my knee, in one visit.  While some follow-up visits are required to completely alleviate certain issues, I was impressed with how quickly I felt relief.  It was also helpful to know that Dr. Justin was involved in the same workout program as me, so he really understood the nature of my pain.  It's nice to be treated someone who appears to \"practice what they preach\" in terms of living a healthful life.\n\nAnd lastly, the staff at Eastern Shore Chiropractic & Sports Clinic is outstanding.  I'm always greeted by friendly faces when I walk in the door and have never had an issue getting an appointment at a time that is convenient for me.  They are honest, and even notified me of a credit that I had on my account that I was unaware of.  I would whole-heartedly recommend Dr. Justin to my family and friends for any sort of sports-related pain issues.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1439669195772, "text": "ThanksJonathan, we really appreciate this wonderful review.

They are amazing women who are genuine, funny, helpful, and most importantly, you can tell they really care about your complete well-being. I\u2019ve struggled with back problems for years and doctors have never been able to properly \u201cfix\u201d me, but after only a few months with Dr. Barb, I am seeing massive improvement in my lower back- pain has been alleviated and range of motion is much better. I\u2019m not \u201ccrooked\u201d in the mornings anymore :) Plus she is so easy to get along with and you feel like you\u2019ve just known her for years, even from the first session. I have also recently added in massage therapy with Robyn and she is extremely talented.

He then proceeded to tell the adult that tried to stop the situation, \"keep that black kid away from my children.\" After speaking with witnesses who are around daily, I find out an entire story was fabricated & instead of this adult speaking to another, he decided to approach a child who couldn't defend themselves.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88897d46ccabfc2d:0xa9459447f5f56620"}

I have so much good to say so I probably can\u2019t make this short. Haha Going to Dr. Browning has been a game changer for both me and my now 4 1/2 month old. We started going when I was 2 months postpartum and looking back I wish we would have gone sooner. It started out with just back pain for me, but I dismissed it because well, I\u2019ve always had back pain and I have just dealt with it and other chiropractors just dealt with the temporary pain but never found the root of it and so it always came back. Well, the pain got worse as I carried a growing baby around and started exercising again after I was released from my doctor after my emergency c-section. My son was also having trouble latching breastfeeding on one side and turning his head to the left. I heard about Dr. Browning through a breastfeeding group in Madison and decided to give it a try. From our first visit, the staff was kind, helpful, and knowledgeable. They even have a nursing mother\u2019s room and the Pediatric room is very kid friendly. After just ONE adjustment we both felt better. Dr. Browning came up with a care plan to treat the root of the issue in my spine and not just treat the pain. After a few adjustments, my son can now turn his head to both sides and he LOVES to go see Dr. B. You can tell she is passionate about what she does and she is so gentle with him.  I love that he\u2019s sleeping better, latching better, his suck has improved, and he has visible relief after every adjustment. He takes the BEST naps after an adjustment. As far as me, I\u2019m pain free in my lower back now and have consistently been feeling better each time I get adjusted too. I\u2019m excited for both me and my son to be feeling better. I\u2019m really sad I didn\u2019t know about Dr. Browning sooner while i was pregnant and I\u2019m excited to see how staying under Dr. Browning\u2019s care helps with my future pregnancy and postpartum journeys.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625278234933, "text": "Thank you so much Heather!

Literally it was better in two days - no stiffness and the knot on the side of my ankle is gone. Amazing! Great job, Doc :) Moral of the story - if you have an ailment, tell Dr. Misty.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596671603388, "text": "We are always honored to take care of entire households and multiple generations from the same family!

I was not ready for Dr's to stick needles in my spine. Nor did I want to start taking narcotics. The pain was overwhelming. I was out of work for an entire week.

I love chiropractic because it's the opposite of this approach and I believe has much better results. My husband has been treated for back problems with noticeable and quick results, I've been treated for back pain and gotten adjustments during pregnancy, my children have been treated for various things including my youngest for colic. From the very first adjustment her colic improved immensely and has continued to do so with weekly adjustments. I'm thrilled! I can't say enough good things about our experiences!

Over the course of my treatment, I've come to know the staff who have always been very kind and professional.  I set my appointments and do not have any issues getting in and out in a timely manner.  Dr. Craig took his time when I first came to him to really assess the situation we were looking at in a surprisingly in-depth manner.  When I first came to Dr. Craig, I was a little worried about the methods that would be implemented. (My dad used to have neck adjustments and seeing that as a kid always terrified me that the neck would easily break with only a little more force.) I'm no longer worried about having neck adjustments as I do trust Dr. Craig now that I know he has my best interests in mind.\n\nNow I am here a year later since I started coming to Dr. Craig and only need to go to essentially monitor my neck condition and make sure it adjusts properly, to see if any new issues arise, etc.  The office is clean and comfortable and the location is easy to access and exit.

Very rarely do I feel the need to leave a review for a doctor's office. But My Chiropracter is AMAZING! Every single person here is so friendly, helpful, and compassionate. They are also some of the most patient people I've ever met. Sometimes it's hard to be patient with me because I'm so scatter-brained, but the staff at My Chiropractor treats me like I'm a part of the family. I'm a very intuitive person, and I can read people pretty well... But I can definitely say, without a doubt, that I know the staff at My Chiropractor genuinely love their jobs. They greet you with bright faces and smiles and ask you how you're doing. They listen and try to relate to your response. They are the epitome of perfect customer service.\n\nDr. Catalfu is so thorough. He asks all the right questions, and listens to every detail to ensure you get the best care possible. He sat with me for over an hour listening to me talk about everything. (Bless his heart, because I'm such a talker, lol.) He's just a genuinely sweet person, and I'm so lucky I found this place. He's also wonderful at adjustments! So many chiropractors won't thoroughly adjust you; they'll just pop your back or pull on your legs. But Dr. Catalfu does everything he can to make you feel comfortable.\n\nI had a horrible migraine for days, that wasn't going away with medicine. So, I started looking for a chiropractor and 5 different chiropracter offices turned me away because I needed an adjustment on such short notice. So, I finally found My Chiropractor and gave them a call. Marilee answered and asked me what was going on. I told her, and she made certain that I could be seen that Friday. She genuinely cared about how I was feeling, and she did her best to squeeze me into a very tight schedule. After my adjustment, my migraine was gone in 10 minutes. I couldn't believe it!\n\nIf you're looking for an amazing chiropractor, give this place a call. I love them! :)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889218619baebed:0x83b90e9321e2c11d"}

Office Manager took all my Insurance info (BCBS Primary & Secondary) She came back to me and said it would be a $30 copay. I informed her that my secondary always pays anything that primary doesn\u2019t. She insisted that I had to pay the $30 that day to be seen. I told her I had had back to back shoulder surgeries with multiple MRIs, Doctor visits, physical therapy etc and have never paid a penny out of pocket. I assured her it would cover everything and asked her to please run both insurances. Her words \u201cYou may be an ethical person but we don\u2019t know you\u201d. That made me feel real cared for and wanted. During our conversation she reiterated multiple times her experience of ten years doing this each time I asked her to please submit both ins plans. Two weeks later she called to say that it was denied apparently due to an incorrect zip +4 code which I did not provide. No problem anyone can make a mistake, even with ten years of experience, correction made and re-filed. Then Twenty days later I received a call saying it was approved and paid in full. Was told I could pick up my $30 reimbursement check in the office. I asked for it to be mailed to me, she said no against office policy, I have to pick it up. I then whined a bit sharing with her that it was a 2 \u00bd hr drive which is very long for a $30 check. She agreed to mail it and hung up.

Not only did she make me feel unappreciated or undesired as a new client but to imply that I was a liar and a cheat, not once but twice is not my idea of a friendly hospitable welcome to the community, which is exactly what we received from our new dental and medical provider, thankful for them. I believe Dr Raley would have been very thorough and Ms Tiffiney (Radiology Tech) was very good and sweet as can be. I called to share my experience with Dr Raley, he listened, thanked me for the feedback and wished me good luck. It\u2019s unfortunate, they lost two new patients, me and my wife.\nSo here we are \u2026.. or should I say go !  Down the road to another office !", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617807976779, "text": "Mr. Hill\nThank you so much for your feedback.  It is indeed our office policy, and legal insurance requires, for us abide by your insurance policy contract and will continue to be such.  We are not allowed to change the insurance policy, to which you have already agreed to abide by.\nIt is unfortunate that you supplied us with the insufficient zip extension resulting in the delay of your reimbursement, however we are glad to hear, with the zip extension corrected, you did receive your full $30 reimbursement from us just as your insurance policy states and we correctly performed.\n\nI believe your frustration stems from 2 common misunderstandings of how insurance is designed.\nFrom the patient\u2019s perspective, smooth coverage of care occurs because there is an underlying mechanism to how that occurs.  The contract you signed regarding your chiropractic care contractually constrains us to take copays.  Your insurance carrier then decides if / how to reimburse.  However, they retain that ability to decide. They do not give that decision ability to the doctor\u2019s office.  They require the office to simply inform / enforce your contract by taking your copay and leaving the decision of reimbursement to your insurance company.\nAlso, although your deductible requirements may be fulfilled through claims from multiple type of healthcare genres, your copays/reimbursement requirements for medical care, dental care and chiropractic care are commonly separate and can be very different.  Your other providers likely acted within their contractual obligations, however we are constrained, by your contract, to work within the realm of the chiropractic agreement which you made with your carrier earlier.\nThose 2 points of misunderstanding on the patient\u2019s part commonly create an environment of frustration for both the patient and the doctor\u2019s office.  Our office manager accurately performed your contractual obligation of your policy perfectly as evidenced by your receipt of the $30 reimbursement we mailed to you.  She did attempt to convey those insights into those 2 common misunderstandings (as you noted) underlying your contract that you signed with your carrier.\nWe perform this equally for all patients (both new and existing) so as to remain in proper relationship with your insurance and in proper relationship with our patients by avoiding favoritism or discrimination against any patient.  This allows us to help as many as possible.  Her 10+ years\u2019 experience pays off for everyone!\nWe are pleased you are here in our community.  You will find our town full of welcoming, good hearted people doing the right things for the right reasons.  Our office manager and radiology technologist are exemplary of that character and that is why they are so highly regarded in their communities, churches, and in healthcare at large.  I am blessed to be on their team.  I know you will be glad you chose Andalusia!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8891ee9e4c501667:0x43e44410f8864361"}

He takes chiropractor care to levels no one has ever heard of in this town. Let's be real for a moment, almost every who's had pain at some point in their life has gone to a chiropractor for help. The standard way of thinking is that if you could just get that elbow to pop back or to have a hip or shoulder reset then all your pain would go away. But it never works, you might find some mild relief but it's usually short lived by a couple of hours to maybe days and then you wake up and say, you slept wrong and it's out again.\n\nWell the team at Invision chiropractic care will teach you how to do address the underlying problems so you can fix it yourself in the long run. Yes you will get adjusted, yes it will probably hurt (Dr. Aplin has a different approach to adjusting that I've ever seen) but I'm a walking, breathing, significantly less pain and overall stress less person than when I walked into his office 4 months ago.\n\nI'll be honest, I have a long history of surgeries to pains and only walked in to this office cause I didn't want to have another surgery and my dear friend suggested Dr. Aplin. I went when I truly didn't believe he was helping. I went when the pain spread to a neighboring body part. I went even though my TOC doc said I needed surgery to fix my problem. 4 months and I never missed an appointment. I can say today that I don't need surgery, my pain is gone and the results of becoming less stressed and worry free was worth more to me than the pain getting better.\n\nBrainTap. Google it. Dr. Aplin introduced me to it and has changed my life because of it. I feel like I have the answer to a life long question that I know so many of us ask \"How do I feel better?\" yes that's generic but let's be honest, everyone is stressing about something these days. But after 4 months of using the BrainTap and doing my homework from Dr. Aplin, I do feel better, lighter able to take on what the world throws at me. It just works!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581024097197, "text": "Lorren - you're a ROCKSTAR!

My daughter was the first of us to use Dr. Mann.  She came in for really bad neck pain and headaches.  Dr. Mann said it was related to what is now being called 'text neck.' In two weeks of treatment she was completely better! Not only that it's been months now and she feels great- and still playing on that phone! The second patient was my son.  We were told he needed tubes in his ears because he had chronic ear infections for months.  It broke my heart thinking about that so I was chatting with Dr. Mann on one of my daughters visits and he told Chiropractic can be successful in treating that without tubes. So we gave it a try (child adjustments are different and very gentle if you didn't know) and low and behold after months of ear infections they were COMPLETELY gone.  We were thrilled- not to mention we saved hundreds avoiding surgery.  The next patient was me!  I do pure Barre and I was having trouble with my low back and knee.  It turns out that I had mobility issues.  Couple weeks of work and my workout is now a breeze. And finally my husband.  He's had back issues before but not quite like this recent one.  He works at a computer all day.  This time the sciatica was going all the way to his foot.  He is currently finishing up his rehabilitation with Dr. Mann and is already pain free!  I am so glad we came here first! No pain, no drugs, we feel great, and at a fraction of the price of surgery.

It looks like it's been said her a 100 times but I wanted to say why my treatments here allow me to say how much I mean that and miss being in Alabama!

I called Dr. Mann before one of my appointments in Atlanta and asked if he would mind talking to my chiropractor (bless him for doing that) Even after an in depth conversation about the type of treatments I was receiving with Dr. Mann in Decatur I still wasn't getting the same level of relief from my Atlanta chiropractor that I was receiving at Advanced Chiropractic.  My neck is just not the same when I go to other places.  I only get to be adjusted a few times a year by Dr. Mann now because of the move and it's one of the worst things about not being home.  But every time  I am in town seeing Dr. Mann is on the list!  Another thing I always appreciated about Dr. Mann's office is there is always a plan.  He doesn't just say 'see ya' at the end of your appointment.  If I am working on an injury I always know when I need to be seen again.  If I am on wellness I know I need to be back monthly.  Other places I have been don't give any direction and it just seems less professional.  Be thankful for what you have here!!! He's the best!

I really thought I got it from my dad but Dr. Mann said a lot of it has to do with lifestyle as well.  I had great results here.  Instant relief, followed by weeks of improvement.  Visits never took that long- barely sat in the waiting room before me treatment begins and I was moved to the next parts of my treatment were with little to no wait.  At the end I did have a few question but Dr. Mann stayed with me to answer my questions.  Nothing beats being able to sleep, wake up, go through a demanding day, and still feel great every day.  I will most definitely keep using Dr. Mann and his clinic on a regular basis.\n\nUpdate 12/23/19-  It has been months since I have had even the slightest pain!

My son's basketball season started up which means lots of driving and uncomfortable locations I must linger in for hours, multiple nights a week.  With the instructions Dr. Mann gave me my back has held up and I have not missed a second of a single game.  They were able to work me in this morning for an adjustment before I hit the road for the holidays.  Dr. Mann even came out to my car to help me setup me seat cushion to keep my back from acting up on the long drive we have to my wife's family gathering in North Carolina.

That's more then my mortgage for what every single other chiropractor has been able to fix and treat in one visit for under $50.00. Please be wise and heed this as a warning.

Health expenses without insurance can be tough, but that is no excuse for your dishonesty in your review. Cameras show your time in the office was approximately 40 minutes; less than 5 minutes in the waiting room- standard for any first visit. Furthermore, we offer the lowest cash prices for new patients in town and also very flexible payment plans.  You were told the prices before you came in. Our cameras even show you were in high spirits until it was time to pay your bill.  And instead of talking to us and working out a payment plan we watched you go into your car and leave this angry review.  Also, what you tried to tell us was \u2018wrong\u2019 with you was actually incorrect and probably the main reason you\u2019ve had to deal with your back pain for years instead of actullay being \u2018fixed.\u2019 While we have great respect for you and your field, you have to remember- you are not a doctor-  for instance a chiropractor in a car accident should heed the EMT\u2019s instructions because that is what they have been trained to do.  You are also confusing your terminology- maintenance is for wellness patients- and is an optional once a month visit for those who have complete their \u2018rehab\u2019 plan to help stay ahead of injuries and reduce wear and tear on the body. Rehab plans are what you were trying to quote. Certain injuries take time to heal and a proper plan for recovery. You are absolutely right Kris- We do things different at Advanced Chiropractic.  We get so many patients who have seen chiropractors that take shortcuts to treat their injuries and the patient continues to deal with pain for years.  Our goal at Advanced Chiropractic is to HEAL the injury. We have found that if we simply make pain go away we are no different than a pain killer or opiate.  However, with our custom made rehabilitation plans you can escape that continued damage, year after year, which is so important as many parts of the body don\u2019t grow back when you repeatedly injure them."}, "gmap_id": "0x886284764f6fef61:0x2058cd07a41eab07"}

Been 3 months now with no issues and with my insurance my care cost harldy nothing.

I have suffered accelerated degenerative disc disease (DDS), spondylosis, and stenosis  in my spine, since age 38. In the past 15 years, my condition has necessitated a spinal fusion (L5-S1), a microdiscectomy (L4-L5),  and a neck (cervical) fusion (C3-C4).       The surgeries were successful with the last neck surgery sparing me from becoming a paraplegic or death. I have been blessed with excellent surgeons and caregivers. I'm grateful.\nI had tried chiropractor prior to my surgeries. The chiropractor worked diligently with me. I also worked hard doing all to help myself. The effort did not help. I would suppose my spine had too many mechanical issues at that time.\nAs I aged, my condition worsened until I was bed fast 18 hours or more each 24 hour cycle. One day as I was laying in bed , the latter part of 2015, I thought maybe I should try chiropractor services again. After all, the surgeries had alleviated some of the worst mechanical problems in my spine. I had 7 primary points of pain. The pain between my shoulder blades was the worse, a grating, stinging type of pain. My thoughts were, If I can knock out 80% of that pain, I would be 30-40% better overall. Also, this pain would mushroom into total body pain, unless I was able to quiet the pain. Laying on ice gel packs would help quiet the pain.\nI obtained the services of Dr. Anthony Houssain at SpineCare.  My first meeting (Jan. 2016) with Dr. Houssain, I laid out my objective. My objective was to lessen the pain between the shoulder blades by 80%.  Dr. Houssain set me on a treatment path to help me accomplish my objective. He was encouraging and very knowledgeable. Dr. Houssain believed he could give me back a part of my life that I had lost.\nOn my second visit,  Dr. Houssain manipulated 3 vertebrates in my thoracic area. I went home and lay down. I had a first, two hours pain free between the shoulder blades. Now, I had hope and believed we were on the right path to accomplish my goal. He has helped me not only to obtain my objective , but to exceed my objective. At times, I do have pain between my shoulder blades. When I experience the pain, I execute the home part of Dr. Houssain's treatment program. Dr. Houssain's treatment program with other tools in my toolbox are sufficient to manage and mostly alleviate the pain between the shoulder blades.\nI love the game of golf. Seven or eight years ago, I was having a good day for me. My son and I decided to play a round of golf. My whole body was in pain after the round. I got home, went to my room, shut the door, and cried my heart out. I was in total body pain and believed I would never play golf again. This was my last round of golf with my son. I did not hit a golf ball for another 7-8 years.\nAfter the pain between my shoulder blades was mostly alleviated and/or pain level lessened, it was time to attempt a round of golf again. On April 19, 2016, I played golf with my son, shooting 89. I was sore, but did not have any serious side-effects. I now play golf, about once a week. I am now able to be up more hours per day.\nMy objective was accomplished with Dr. Houssain's help. In fact, it would not have happened without him. I am not well, but I have a much better life. Will I continue to improve or will the good ride end? I don't know, but I know it been a much better ride since April. I thank the good Lord for putting people in my life to help me, Dr Houssain being one of those people.\nI know every one is different, and one may obtain better results than me, or not obtain as good results as me. But, I always have kept trying to find any nugget that would help me be better. I hope those who read this, will keep trying to find that nugget for themselves. If one keeps trying, they may well find the nugget that makes their life better.. Keep on, keeping on.

I made an appointment with Dr. Hussain at Spine Care & he ordered an MRI which showed my problem was not spurs but Achilles tendonitis & a tear in the tendon.

She was diagnosed with having excess fluid on and around the eardrum, a condition which causes hearing loss and typically causes ear infections. We had taken her to an ENT and pediatrician, and both recommended surgery to put tubes in to help drain the fluid off her eardrum.\n\nAfter her diagnosis, we visited Dr Mix twice a week for adjustments at approx 2 months old. In only a months time, we have seen vast improvement.  Her last ENT visit was a couple of days ago. She finally passed her hearing exam for the very first time in both ears!!! There is still a small amount of fluid remaining, but our ENT detected a noticable reduction in the amount, and has postponed the need for tubes.\n\nWe will continue to seek weekly treatment with Dr Mix, and are so happy that his treatments allowed us a non-invasive approach to restore our  baby's hearing. Dr Mix has been wonderful to work with through such a difficult time. He has taken extra care to go over computer readings with us that have  conclusively shown the gradual improvement at each stage as well. My daughter  has smiled and cooed through every adjustment (no, they don't hurt AT ALL). As a side benefit, one of the computer screenings showed she also had a vertabrae out of alignment which can affect digestion as well. After her adjustments we have also seen improvement in this area also.\n\nParents, DO NOT HESITATE to schedule an appointment for your babies and children at this office. Both Dr Mix and Yvonne are wonderful to work with, and show genuine concern for us at each visit. The office is super clean, and has very up to date equipment too.

The focus of that response is explaining the membership and 2 month commitment which I never asked or said I was confused by. I understand that it takes time for an adjustment to make things better (as I stated I assumed that was the issue at first) BUT after multiple visits the pain should be getting better not worse. It's insane to expect someone to continue treatment for 2 months that is causing pain. In the future, it would be helpful if a business response is helpful and not just say irrelevant things to provide a response.\n\nI was really excited to have a location close to my house and hopeful the frequent adjustments would be helpful. After my first visit I felt great and decided to do the membership to make sure frequent visits was economical for me. You're required to do 2 months of membership which wasn't a problem for me at the time BUT after multiple visits (they give you a few free visits so you can get in twice a week at the beginning as recommended), I was in more pain. At first I assumed it my muscles adjusting to a new and better alignment but the pain lasted way too long after my visits. I decided to go see a different chiropractor group that maybe has more focus on time with patients versus the in and out style of The Joint. Luckily the pain started to resolve after my first visit at the new practice. Unfortunately I wasted money for 2 months of treatment at The Joint where I spent one month in pain and paid for a 2nd month (obligated) where I'm not going. You're also required to cancel your membership in person which is going to be difficult. I think the idea of The Joint is great but I also think the \"drive thru\" style isn't meant for when you have actual back problems or want more personalized care.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1623086212271, "text": "Hi Katelyn,\n\nThank you for sharing and please know we are very sorry that you weren't fully satisfied by your experience.

I have experienced many different chiropractic practices in different states. We just moved here and after a visit to Cornerstone Family Chiro in the area, I was seeking a different technique and a pay-by-the-visit. Cornerstone asks you to pay for the full treatment (mine was months and took all my insurance covered visits and more) and then refunds you whatever you may not use. I didn\u2019t really prefer that. They were nice and had lots of social events but I wanted a more treatment focused  (not that they weren\u2019t, this is just me), so I just googled and wasn\u2019t very hopeful. Dr. Le\u2019s came up and oh my goodness, I could not be happier!!! I want everyone to know! Dr. Le offers many different ways of treating the injury/misalignment (not just an adjustment) and all of it is to help you heal as soon and as quickly as possible. I will absolutely continue to go and am wanting my husband to go too! So thankful to have found a great chiro in the area!!! He was also happy to explain each technique and how it helped as well. Took the time and listened to all my issues and literally treated every single issue. This is not just chiropractic! He even sent me home with exercises to strengthen my back, etc. I can\u2019t recommend him enough. And Amy, his assistant, was present at all times during my treatment and did a great job to help treat me as well! Looking forward to my next visits! I know I wrote a novel, but really, I am so glad to have found a thorough doctor in the area!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1561650819229, "text": "Thank you a lot Mrs. Bowling for taking the time to leave  a great review!

Unfortunately, I won't be returning here due to the way this company deals with their customers financially.\nI saw Dr. Robinson back in October 2017 and again in November 2017. He's always great, he has great bedside manners, and he cracks me up.  Everything was awesome as usual. I paid my copay, was told I have a $0 balance, and was good to go both times. I never like to have balances, so I pay whatever I owe when I see a doctor.\nFast forward SEVEN MONTHS LATER, I get a BILL in the mail for unpaid fees that apparently only went towards my deductable and now I owe $88. I called last Monday and was told I'd have to call next Monday to speak to the billing person, so I waited 7 more days and called today. She went over the bill in detail, including how they even gave me some discount to adjust my bill as if they're doing me a favor.\nI maintained my voice and words and told her I guess I have no choice but to pay this bill, even though you guys waited over a half year to bill me. I told her I was coincidentally planning on coming back to see Dr. Robinson again but now that I got this bill, I'll be going somewhere else. She told me \"well I'm sorry you feel that way.\"\nSo, that's that. I'll miss Dr. Robinson because he's literally a miracle worker, but this billing and the way the company manages their patient's accounts is **extremely** unprofessional.  It does not take 7 months for people's health insurance to get back to you. This is 100% P3's fault due to negligence, laziness...maybe both.\n\nWhat's funny is my husband got a free massage session from them in the mail the same week I got that bill...he hasn't seen Dr. Robinson in over a year.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f544b4c8a7:0x4331ab6555e87ed7"}

I advise anyone who's thinking about coming to this practice to find another Dr office.

After my current pediatrician, Dr. Rivas, advised it was time to transition to an adult provider. During the time he was my provider, Dr. Ginevan worked alongside my psychiatrist to continue maintenance of my ADHD and when necessary, he worked with specialists to manage my delicate GI condition. This included references to appropriate clinics and scheduling of applicable tests ie. Colonoscopy, EGD, etc. I truly trusted Dr. Ginevan and was incredibly grateful to have found such a wonderful physician. I never minded the fact that his office was always moving locations or that his appointments had become a nightmare to secure. I still referred only my closest of friends and family to see him. Always assuring them they'd be nothing less than satisfied with him as they're provider. Those were the old days... in 2013 I moved away to live on base with my then husband. I moved back in 2015 and returned to Dr. Ginevan. He and his staff had undergone a complete restructuring as they were now a part of the mega-merger trend and had merged with the tri-cities health giant Shoals Primary Care LLC. Due to the merger Dr. Ginevan no longer had any of my previous medical records from all of my time spent under his care which led to massive complications to my continuity of care. (I now understand the importance of my responsibility to secure medical history documentation and maintain my own current updated personal medical record.) Also, SADLY, due to the implementation of a governmental-esque standard of operating procedures, it is my opinion that Dr. Ginevan no longer maintained the level of patient care he had became known for. His office staff has always been grade-A; to be commended. If you are considering seeing Dr. Ginevan as your primary care provider this review is for you. In closing I want to say that this review in no way, intends to slander or cause malice. This review is my personal experiential reference/opinions of Dr. Ginevan meant solely for the purpose of socially informing fellow peers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

I ignored that fact and still decided to give the doctor the benefit of the doubt because I could understand things sometimes happen. However, upon my scheduled visit as a first time patient it was for 7:30 am, and I arrived at 7:15 am for new patient paper work. I signed in and no one even showed up at the front desk until my appointment time, where I  then asked for my paper work and filled it out. About ten minutes after that, another woman called me by the wrong name and when I corrected her, I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong. Also, you can not hear when you are being called because the TV is loud, so people are talking over the TV, and I have two ear infections. After filling out my paper work, I was then called back to the window, where I was asked to write down my SSN, but I had already written it down twice on the form already. This told me they obviously were not paying attention to the information they were entering. After this, and already feeling on edge from just the front desk experience, I am called back by the doctor's nurse practitioner who tells me to step on the scale, and with a horrible tone says, \"you're going to have to take some of that off.\" Meaning my purse. I ask where I should put it in case of a designated area, which seem to make her even more annoyed and she replies with, \"I don't know.\" Very snappy. I am a new patient and felt like I was asking a very simple and non offensive question. We then walk to the exam room where she informs me that I would not be seeing the doctor and that he also would never been doing my exams or ever seeing me other than a quick peek in the room. Which, as someone looking for a long term doctor, it does not feel comfortable not even meeting my doctor on the first visit. When I tried to explain that I was uncomfortable with the fact she would only be relaying my issues to the doctor, and that I didn't feel comfortable having my health looked after in third person, and that I didnt understand why they wouldn't tell a new patient to begin with when making an appointment that he or she won't be seeing a doctor. She then got upset about it and told me I could reschedule or abort because she had been doing this for 40 years. Which is fine and I explained to her I was fine with her seeing me, but that I didn't feel comfortable having a doctor diagnose me without speaking with me and knowing me as a person. She gets more upset and I said I think it would be best just to cancel because at that point, being someone who has been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, I was overwhelmed and ready to go home. She proceeded to then say to me, \"Fine then. Adios.\" I feel as if the entire situation was unprofessional on many different levels. I decided to keep searching for a new doctor. I would not advise this practice if you want to get to know your doctor for long term use, or have anxiety issues, seeing as how it is the only doctor's office I have ever been in where the lobby is loud and over packed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

Amanda has cared for every member of my family, from my mom, husband, three year old son, and newborn. Amanda is great with kids and my son LOVES visiting \"Dr. Amanda\". He has no clue he is getting adjusted because he is having so much fun with her. When my husbands back locked up the week of Christmas, Amanda worked him in ASAP despite her holiday schedule. Because of his weekly adjustments, my husband is able to run again, which he hasn't been able to do in years because of his back pain. Amanda also cared for me throughout my pregnancy. I give her credit for my easy delivery! After my daughters birth, she adjusted my newborn and it helped with her colic. You could see the relief in her face after an adjustment.\nAmanda's office staff is friendly and she and her staff are constantly going out of their way to provide excellent customer service. Whether it's scheduling an appointment, or needing to bring the kids with me, the staff is always helpful.\nOne thing that stands out about Amanda's chiropractic care which separates her from other chiropractors, is she is always going to seminars and learning the latest techniques. She is very passionate about what she does and wants to provide the best care possible.

The last time I can remember going to a chiropractor was in 2004 and I honestly never had a bad experience, however, I also never had an experience that  benefited me enough to continue the care.  I became skeptical of chiropractors, skeptical of orthopedic practices, and skeptical of the health industry in some respects.  After unsuccessfully managing my pain due to a shoulder injury, arthritis, and degenerative issues, which all became more acute within the last 15 months, I decided to seek out an alternative to surgery and medications.  Chiropractic care resurfaced as a suggestion to me by a co-worker and I begin to search the local area for a destination to try to combat my persistent and nagging pain and discomfort.   I chose to meet Dr. Kristoffer Johnson based on the hundreds of successful reviews, his experience, and the overwhelming positive welcoming by team members, Bethany and Amy.    They are truly a team that works in unison.  They are truly invested into their patients health improvements and well-being.  They are truly honest, caring people that serve and make a difference in many, many lives.   Another MOST wonderful experience with Back on Track is that a planned number or subscription of visits was not prescribed to me like so many outlets build their potential success around.  \"Let's get you better.\"   I can tell you Dr. Johnson, Bethany, and Amy, more than once, have iterated this as their focus and I am truly blessed and thankful to report that my health has improved.   The combination of therapy services and adjustments is not only beneficial to my physical well-being, it is mentally enabling as well!   On top of that,  I enjoy reading the blog posts on the website and educating myself with what Dr. Johnson's shares through his many years of experience.   After the first week of therapy and adjustments the agony of my discomfort started to go in a different direction.  Halleluiah!   Several weeks of consistent therapy and adjustments is proving to be the best thing I could have invested in for my overall health.   I am confident and positive that I am now \"Back on Track!\"   Thank you Dr. Johnson, Bethany, and Amy!!   I am very much encouraged and looking forward to continuing this health building relationship!  Many Blessings!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

Decompression Therapy has worked for me, I thank God for the staff and Dr. Kristoffer Johnson. On my first visit I was in so much pain, I was dragging my leg when I walked. Not any more, thank you Back On Track Chiropractic Center.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

The location is perfect and within minutes from my job.  I contacted them via email and got a response and appointment very promptly.  When I arrived for my first visit, I was in so much pain and couldn't turn my head to the left side. The staff (Amy and Beth) always greets you with a smile, warm conversations and pleasantries making you feel super special... they are absolutely outstanding professionals.. Also the atmosphere is pleasant, friendly and welcoming...almost heavenly.  Dr. Kris Johnson is an awesome guy!! The fact that you're not waiting around all day to be seen..  He takes time to explains your conditions/situations/issues and recommends a plan of action as to how he will work to get you some relief and feeling better.  See, I took a nasty fall down my basement stairs that resulted in several vertebrae out of alignment. By my third visit, the pain was down 2 scales (from 10 to 8) and now, after my 8th visit, I'm down to 5 more scales with some occasionally shoulder pain but no more numbness in arm or tingling in left hand.  I'm able to turn my head all the way to the left side with no pain and move my neck up and down freely. On top that, I'm  not having to pop pain pills...icing the area once or twice a day does the trick. I didn't intend to write such long review but I am reminded that the Word of God tells us to give honor where honor is due.  I 100% believe Dr. Johnson and his staff really deserve such worthy praises and recognition for what they're doing not only in my life but others everyday.  My prayer is that God continues to bless and prosper them and this wonderful Chiropractic office for many, many years to come.\n\nThank you,\n\nCindi Smith", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

I'm a 30-year old, active female that had never experienced back pain! I had been experiencing a sudden onset of sharp pain in my lower back that became debilitating (a few hours after moving my Christmas tree, or so I thought). I'm a RN, so i knew to do the basics of applying ice/heat, resting, numbing creams, OTC pain meds, massage, etc. Although these methods provided some relief, it was temporarily. I was regaining some mobility, but nowhere near my baseline! I was having pain upon bending, walking, lying on my stomach and back, and even sitting. My coworker recommended that I come to Dr.Johnson at Back on Track. I decided to give it a try because my methods were not working. What a great decision! The customer service i received  was EXCELLENT and the atmosphere in the office was very inviting and calming!  I received my services with little to no wait time, which is very rare for visiting a doctor's office. The ENTIRE staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and encouraging! I received a tour of the facility and how each product/machine worked, education on what to expect, what to do to assist with my treatment upon leaving, and most importantly a remarkable service. I literally went from requiring assistance because of extreme pain and discomfort when sitting up to sitting up without assistance, IN MINUTES!!! Although I do have to return to the office for continued therapy, I immediately felt the benefits of my visit. I'm so thankful I decided to come to this office. Dr. Johnson and his staff literally got me \"Back on Track!\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

His head and upper body were craned backwards all the time. He was nearly impossible to hold or cuddle. By week 4, even more stiff and rigid, he began to show signs that he was in pain and quit using his right arm and hand. He began having what we were perceiving to be seizures any time he was put on his back. We couldn't change his diaper without these seizure-like episodes. He would cry out in pain every time we picked him up. We took him to the pediatrician who made referrals for us to see Early Intervention and an orthopaedic specialist. Weeks went by as we waited patiently on our appointments. In the meantime, our son was getting worse and worse. Each day brought on more pain and he spent all of his waking hours crying. I didn't have time to wait anymore and it was at that point that I began looking for alternate routes. Enter, Family Tree Chiropractic! They were able to fit us in the very day I called (I literally hung up the phone and sobbed tears of joy). During the visit, we placed our stiff, crying, painful, rigid baby who was having his seizure episodes right there, on the table and Dr. Chris began patiently working. He was so gentle that my husband and I weren't even sure anything had happened! That evening however, our son's arm and hand \"woke up\" as we noticed he was spastically moving it by himself for the first time in weeks. The next day the range of motion in his neck was drastically, and I mean DRASTICALLY different. After his second visit, the seizure episodes almost vanished completely and he no longer seemed to be in pain! Fast forward to 15 weeks old, he is growing healthy and has been reaching milestones - something we don't think could have happened with his immobility, rigidity, and pain level. We do not have the words for what Dr. Chris has done for our baby and our family. For those on the fence about infant chiropractic care, I can say that our sweet baby would not be where he is today without it. One million thank you's to Dr. Chris and Family Tree Chiropractic!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0fea32f30b9f:0xb70fdf1840b776fc"}

I did not know this is what I had until I came here.\n\nAs smart as doctors are, no one ever did an x-ray of my lower back, much less any other part of my back.\n\nI went to a sports medicine doctor who diagnosed me with a grade 1 tear on my hamstring.  So I did physical therapy for that and took strong anti-inflammatories.\n\nI then went again and a orthopedic doctor got annoyed with me when trying to describe the nerve pain I was having in my left leg.  He was less than kind and referred me to a neurologist.\n\nThis fellow was nice and recommended an MRI of my left knee thinking I had a tear in it.\n\nThe MRI 4,000 dollars later revealed a knee with little more than a bit of arthritis 'normal for my age'.\n\nSo with no further instructions for recovery, I sought the help of Dr. Jess.\n\nShe immediately did an x-ray which revealed the issues with my spine.  Of course without an MRI, no one can say with 100% certainty I have a herniated disc, but it is with 90% accuracy or so they can say it.\n\nWe had my uncle in law confirm as much who is a neuro and back surgeon.  Now he didn't think a chiropractor was the answer, but doctors and chiropractors have a predictable relationship...\n\nI've done almost all 25 of my sessions now.  When I first went in, I was getting to the point where it was painful to even exist.  I did not want to live some days with the pain I was having.\n\nI am not healed by any means but I feel SO, SO much better.\n\nI am working out my upper body now and pursuing things I thought I wouldn't be able to do again.  I am smart enough to know surgeries are over diagnosed.  Our medical world is riddled with doctors who want to perform surgeries.  People are having to get artificial hips and knees replaced within their life times now.  This is because they are having it done too young.\n\nI cannot say a chiropractor is the answer for you.  I can say that at least I want to live now.  I am not in unbearable pain.  I can function.\n\nMaybe I will have to get surgery at some point.  I don't know.  The fact of the matter is that right now I don't have to.  My insurance sucks.  I could afford this.  I cannot afford surgery.\n\nMake your own decision, but hopefully this helps someone.\n\nAs for the staff and the place of business, it is wonderful.  I love the people and the space.  Dr. Jess is so positive along with Victoria.  Their spirits will lift you up.  They aren't annoying though.  It doesn't seem artificial.\n\nIf you read this far, I'm sorry for making this so long.

Wow, what a difference, decompression has reduced the nagging pain, the first morning after, I woke up because I was rested!  Hadn't done that since...before accident.

Your input is appreciated.\nYour perspective on the first visit is different than most of our patients but significant. The intake paperwork asks the patient to list all their symptoms and quantify their health complaints and instructs the patients to quantify their level of improvement over the next 12 treatments.... That is correct. The reason the paperwork addresses a treatment plan is so patients are aware from the beginning that holistic treatment is not a one treatment panacea, it's not a pill and it's not magic. It is a healing process and the specifics are handled individually with each patient.\nA 20 minutes face to face with a physician is unheard of these days and if you feel that was a short visit so be it. In a 20-minute visit we addressed the entire human frame above and beyond the chief complaint plus acupuncture and tongue analysis. The process didn't stop when you left the office but it continued as the tongue analysis was performed by OUM physicians in California and THERE WERE THREE EMAIL CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFICS. That was a step I take out of true concern for the health and well-being of my patients but it's cases like these that make excellent physicians become callus.\nBest of luck on your journey and next time find something to praise about the next person that gives a damn about your health and well-being"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892927a6c918d1b:0x6fa1927cce21bd5d"}

I spoke with them, and was asked if i was being treated for the pain. I told them not yet, but i used to go to a local chiropractor, and was gonna go back very, very soon.\nI was asked where i went, and when told, the lawyer started laughing, the doctor, and the lawyer have been college for the longest time, and the lawyer sends hundreds of cases to Dr Kaul....Huh, small world..\nMy lawyer knows my doctor..\nSo to shorten this some, i was treated by Dr Kaul over a couple months, and even looked forward to it; talking to the staff, even becoming friends. The fact i felt so much better after leaving left a great association with the habit of going a couple times a week.\nAfter treatment, my papers were directly presented to Mr Moore, and he helped me with my case in a very straight forward manner.\nSo between these two professionals, and their staffs, i felt very taken care of, and confident that i was more than a $ symbol with legs.\nA++", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d12635cecc5:0x80d5f7984d2315ca"}

Dr. Douglas Kaul is very knowledgeable, is down to earth and doesn't pull punches. He shows and explains all he finds on the x-rays, which he takes himself.  He makes you feel comfortable; listens to your concerns regarding your treatment options and plan, answering any questions you may have.  Diane, his nurse, is very nice and engages you; always finding something to say to make you smile.

Dr. Kaul, his associates and staff have great compassion for every person who comes for help.   After your first visit, you will realize the care you receive is focused on getting you up and moving again, as pain free as possible.

Also, they learn your name during the first visit. Dale is an awesome tech and makes you feel right at home. The ladies and gentlemen at the front desk are ALWAYS nice and professional as well.

I found Jason when I was around 35 because I was working a job that required alot of lifting and carrying of a 28 foot extention ladder over long distances about 15 times a day. I had gotten to the point that it caused me such pain to even bend over to tie my shoes that I couldn't take it.\n\nI found Dr Hart at Sturbridge on Taylor Rd. I saw him therethere for a few years and I followed him after he left to start his own practice because he was the most skilled Chiropractor I had ever been to see, but also because of his regard for people and how he saw the way their wallets and insurance plans were treated. What I mean there without going into a full out explanation is, Dr Jason Hart is one of those doctors you rarely find, he cares much more about you and your well being than he does about your wallet.\n\nI'm 45 now and had it not been for Jason and the lengths he goes to for his patients/friends, to learn his craft inside and out like no other.....well I would still be suffering day to day with a great deal of pain.

We came here in hopes of getting our problems fixed, already explaining that we have financial problems and may have to cancel in the future if we get to where we can't afford it. After running this payment program for a month, we got into a bind with bills and found we couldn't keep up with paying over $400 a month just for adjustments. We have a 10 month old to take care of, we have to make sure our bills are paid. We decide to cancel, me and my sister, and were met with almost immediate change in behavior. My last two adjustments, I was rushed out of the building without even getting my TENS therapy. It hasn't been 30 days since we canceled and today, my sister receives a bill in the mail claiming she owes over $900 for several things. I'll make sure I post pictures of this bill with her information cut out. To break this down, we came in on a special $20 that they had going for the evaluation and X Ray. On this bill, she was charged $20 for each. $35 to process the x Ray. $55 for each adjustment. $35 for each therapy session (tens unit). $7 dollars everytime they placed an ICE PACK on her back. It was several of these adding up to $914 and some change. This was absolutely the most  ridiculous thing I've seen from a practice. I do NOT recommend going here, they will ring you for every penny they can get and the mask falls off as soon as you run into financial difficulties. No one should ever be scammed like this.

I never put much faith in chiropractors before, but Dr. Kyle & Renee are different along with the Maximized Living essential tenets.  They take a more Biblical view that our bodies were designed & created by God to function perfectly and to be able to heal itself as long as there is no interference along the spine and central nervous system.  Since I have been going to Lopez Family Chiropractic, I no longer take any prescription anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics or any over-the-counter medicines, but I have not gotten sick at all in the past 8 years.  Many times I have been surrounded by very sick co-workers with colds or flu and I stayed healthy.  I follow the 5 essentials of Maximized Living including exercise, a healthy diet, weekly adjustments to keep my nerve supply flowing from my brain to all parts of my body, and minimizing toxins in my environment. I feel great and have more energy now than I did ten years ago!  Another great thing about Lopez Family Chiropractic is the educational seminars on various health topics, exercise and food tips, dinners & make-over events, and the caring, family atmosphere at the clinic.  I have learned so much to enhance my life and gained information to share with friends and family to help them get on the road to healthy lives.

I have been to several other chiropractors and been dissatisfied with their service.

My back had gone out and I was afraid that I was going to have to go to the hospital.  Instead,  a friend recommended Dr. Thompson so I made an appointment.  Within two weeks of adjustments I felt remarkably better.  One reason I feel so strongly about recommending him is that he is the first Dr. who was more concerned with helping me get better than lining up the next 5 patients.

It really feels like they are just trying to make more money... I don't like to complain but I feel like everyone needs to know. Also the receptionist is very hard to understand!!! I was even willing to wait as long as it took for the doctor to catch up and have time to look at the x-rays but still nobody was willing to help me. At all. They need to be more reasonable. For some people paying for one more visit is really hard. Especially for families with multiple children!!!

The office manager at this business is ABSOLUTELY THE MOST RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL PERSON I HAVE EVER SPOKEN TOO. I came in probably 7 months ago, It was my first visit to ever see a chiropractor, and was in a lot of pain. I paid like $150-$175  that day just because I told them SPECIFICALLY that I did not want a bill in the mail and I would pay whatever that day just to go ahead and get it out of the way. I saw Dr. Jumper and he was very nice and helpful. I thought that I was going to be very pleased with my experience. 6 MONTHS LATER, I received a bill in the mail from them asking me for $35. Soon after I received the bill in the mail I gave them a call to ask some questions about my bill. She began to tell me that I still owed $35 and that the lady that I was working with got fired because of doing stuff like this and not charging me the full amount. I begin to tell her what I paid that day and I asked specifically if I could take care of it the day of the visit. I then asked her if she could just take care of it for me because it was not my mistake it was the employees. Her tone immediately changed and she said \"You still have to pay your bill regardless and if you don't we will be reporting you to collections.\" I tried to explain to her that I am a loyal customer and I just do not think it is right for me to have to pay this and she kept talking over me and raising her voice. THEN, SHE HUNG UP ON ME. Today I receive a phone call from the business and I was on the other line and could not answer, and immediately call back, and no answer. The point of the matter is, IF YOU ARE RUNNING A LOCAL BUSINESS, YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE YOUR CLIENTELE. IF AN EMPLOYEE DOES SOMETHING WRONG, YOU DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED. REGARDLESS. If you are looking for a local chiropractor DO NOT go to this business unless you are wanting to get SCAMMED.

This isn't healthy for anyone. It puts a lot of pressure on your legs, hips and lower back.

All the staff members; Jessica, Lucy, Ashley, Madison, Shannon, and Alex have been exceptionally kind, caring, professional, and are very knowledgeable of their profession. Not only this, but they have shown a great deal of compassion given the pain that I was in.\nI have gotten to know all of them and have grown to like and respect each and everyone of them. Never have I looked forward to any of my medical appointments like I do to Millar Chiropractic. Each time I walk into their office I am welcomed with a very friendly greeting; they make me feel at home with their first words. It is indeed a pleasure to be one of their patients.\nDr. Justin beyond any doubt, is the most knowledgeable and professional Chiropractor I\u2019ve ever been to; and I\u2019ve been to many. His methods and standard practices have been very effective, and I feel like I\u2019m well on my way to recovery.\nOne thing that you don\u2019t find in most medical practices these days is a Doctor who will sit down with you and discuss every detail of your treatment. Dr. Justin will spend as much time with you as you need to ask questions, so that you fully understand how your treatment will progress.\nI highly recommend Millar Chiropractic", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKiASLmlNdJcfLDhZ1YCSVZzJ3htQF8OWLcg7j=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1528226427165, "text": "Thank You"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268e9bbbae44d:0xbab1503fa575b893"}

Well we move to Huntsville in August 2018 and it had been about 5 months since my last visit to a chiropractor.  I noticed one morning that my right arm had numbness and tingling.  This exacerbated to my fingertips over a period of a week.  I went into Fox medical on base; of course, they gave me pain medication and sent me on my way with a referral to pain management.  I made an appointment with Millar Chiropractic because I knew there was something wrong with my spine.  By this time, (around Thanksgiving 2018), I was in excruciating pain and on the verge of wanting my arm amputated to just get rid of the pain.  Dr. Justin sat down with me and listened to my story with great patience and intrigue.  He recommended an MRI, which I got done a few days later at Crestwood Imaging & Diagnostic Center.  Come to find out my cervical disc\u2019s were both compressed and herniated causing the pain and discomfort.  My entire career it was my lower back that had issues, never my neck.  Dr. Justin immediately got me into therapy consisting of cervical decompression, cold laser, and TENS, along with spinal adjustments.  TRICARE does not cover chiropractic care, so working with his AWESOME Staff, they were able to set up a financial plan that fit my budget.  It\u2019s Feb 2019 and I am back at 100%, if not better!  If it were not for Dr. Justin and his amazing staff, I would probably be on heavy narcotics only masking the pain and creating a worse situation for my spinal cord.  I would like everyone to come in for at least one visit and see what he can do or help out with in your spinal health.  I am a firm believer in chiropractic care and how it can help in all aspects of your life and daily functions.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1549380936357, "text": "Thank You Eldar for those kind words.

I was seeing a neurologist tying to get my migraine headaches under control and seeking relief for my back. Of course the first thing he ordered was physical therapy which only complicated the problem. Next step was medication which only turned me into a zombie. Next step I was recommended to a surgeon for consultation. The doctor  walked in the exam room without speaking, looked at my films and simply said nothing here I can help you with and stared to walk out. I stopped him and ask what I was supposed to do? He shrugged his shoulders and left. At this point I was   tears.  My primary doctor sent me to another surgeon. Another extensive schedule of physical therapy. This was before we moved here to Athens last year. I was desperate for relief.  I was looking for doctors on line and came across Millar Chiropractic. I thought after a neurologist, injections, two surgeons and extensive physical therapy it was time to try this approach.  I know this is a lengthy post but I felt I had to go through this first to give a reason for for my sincere recommendation. I made an appointment and so thankful I did. At the end of my consultation Dr. Walbom sent me for ex rays. A plan was made for treatment. The a office staff couldn't be more friendly, they make you feel welcome when you walk through the door. The people that set you up for treatment are always checking on you to make sure you are comfortable and relaxed. I am into my sixth treatment and have already experienced relief. Dr. Walbom talks with me after each session and I couldn't be more confident that I will come out of this office feeling like a new person. I can't say enough good words to encourage you to know this office staff and Dr.  Walbom  will actually listen to you and they care about your pain.

Dr. Klein treated my neck and back pain but also took the time to advise me on the most ergonomic set-up for my job to prevent neck and back pain in the future.

We are a small family business who strives to treat our patients like family, with the upmost care and respect. We have seen amazing results through chiropractic for many of our patients, but it is very true that if we feel something else might benefit them to achieve their healthcare goals (like orthotic inserts, physical therapy, or referring to a medical specialist), we will encourage our patients to seek those treatment options. We wholeheartedly believe in chiropractic care, but we also believe that it isn't the answer for every case that comes in our office---which is why we often recommend orthotic inserts, etc. We do not sell nor are we affiliated with any sort of orthotic insert, we have just seen so many patients respond really well (especially folks whom are quite active or on their feet all day) to shoe inserts which is why we will often recommend folks to try them out \u2014 so sorry if we ever came off as pushy, it was never our intention.

Was told that my pelvis was tilted one way on one side and a different way on the other, subluxations were present in several places, and my kneecaps were not in the proper place. Realizing this treatment plan was going to be a sizeable investment both in time and money I decided to seek out a second opinion. (Honestly, felt kind of like I was at a cattle call with the first guy.) This is how I met Dr. Drew. His diagnosis jived with the first one, but his approach was so much better! First of all, he did not want to do duplicate XRays. He tried to save me money and exposure to radiation by having by having me pick up my first set of XRays from the other place. Secondly, he was quick to say that he did not work miracles but did believe he could help me. His estimation of treatments required was fewer than the other guy, but we were still in for months of multiple treatments per week. I gladly started treatment immediately.\n\nAfter about 3 weeks Dr. Drew advised that I was not getting the kind of relief he expected and ordered an MRI. Kind of freaked me out and I tried bargaining with him explaining that I had actually not been resting and icing like he recommended. He was supremely patient and convinced me to have the MRI. The test showed that I had a congenital condition called Diastematomyelia which had never been diagnosed. My spinal cord was split and tethered. Apparently the condition is rare and we began a frantic search for a neurosurgeon who had actually performed the surgery before. Dr. Drew was with me every step, answering questions, sending referrals, and calming my nerves. This condition left untreated could eventually have caused more loss of strength and coordination, incontinence, and paralysis.\n\nToday I am 3 weeks post op. 2 surgeons operated on me for 8 hours. All signs as of now indicate that the surgery was a complete success. Dr. Drew, through his unwavering commitment to patient care, got this journey started and I owe him a debt of gratitude. The only argument that I have with him is that I believe he is a miracle worker in getting this condition diagnosed.\n\nbtw - Mel is awesome and keeps the office running like a well oiled machine!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481747609736, "text": "Thank you, Ms. Rhonda!
