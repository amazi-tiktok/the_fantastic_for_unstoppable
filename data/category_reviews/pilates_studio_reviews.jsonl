I was (and still am) unable to continue a membership during the pandemic because I have severely immune compromised people in my family. I told them this and they said they'd cancel my membership ... but to my great surprise, I just noticed that they decided to go ahead and charge me for TWO MONTHS - $438 - on my credit card. I received NO notification of this charge at all, and as a result I paid late fees on my credit card. I find it outrageous that in the middle of a pandemic, when people are struggling emotionally, physically, and financially, a business would exploit its clients in this manner.

Early on in my career I had learned the importance of staying in shape.  I found that being physically in shape kept my mind sharp, a real advantage in business.  So, realizing now that I would have more free time I assumed I would work out even more.  The opposite occurred, without the structure of working every day I began to enjoy a leisurely lifestyle.\n\nIt became very easy to just relax and put off exercise until the next day which became the next day and the next day and so on until I quit going all together.  As time went on I began to gain weight and my mind was no longer as sharp.  One day I said to my wife enough is enough I need to do something about this now.  As a longtime client of Studio G \u2013 who along with a chiropractor cured her vertigo- she convinced me to try pilates.  I did not even know what pilates was but I thought something different from what I had always done could be fun.\n\nThe first time I did pilates on the reformer I could not believe the total workout I could do without hurting myself.  In fact, I have been going to Studio G for almost 2 years now, I am now 68 years old and I have never hurt any part of my body.  Something I could not say about my other exercise routines, especially as I aged.\n\nPilates with Genevieve and Ryan at Studio G has changed my life.  I go 2-3 times a week where not only do I have an hour of Pilates but spend another hour being stretched and doing release work.  They even taught me how to walk properly - most people don\u2019t walk correctly and it makes a big difference.\n\nNow, I am considerably stronger, more flexible, have better posture with broader shoulders, I have more energy and mentally I feel GREAT.\n\nGenevieve and Ryan make the experience even more enjoyable as they are just wonderful people who I enjoy being around.  Today, besides my wife and I, my two daughter and son go as well.  Ryan and Genevieve feel like a part of our family as we all spend so much enjoyable time together.\n\nI highly recommend Studio G and their entire team.  Thanks Studio G for getting me back in the game of life.\n\nBob M", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891965b0a72bcb:0x4ef23b7738b92124"}
