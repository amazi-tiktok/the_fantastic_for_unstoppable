Tried calling them  all morning  drove up from  Birmingham  get there  they already sold it  we really was not upset at that   They we\u2019re just rude  when we asked about  it  just short and hateful   We will do business somewhere else", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1612900626731, "text": "Sir, we are sorry that you feel we run a bad business. The ad said first come, first serve. So yes, we did say that the first one to come in with the deposit, got it. Our business hours are posted on Facebook and Google. The only days we are not in the office is on Saturday afternoon/evening to Sunday. We do try to spend those days with family and \"leave work, at work\". We are sorry this has upset you enough to leave a bad review, but we are more than happy to keep an eye out for another repo for you in the future.  Please understand that if we held everything for someone that simply asked how to pay a deposit, we wouldn't sell much, because people do not always show up when they say they will. Again, if you would like us to be on the look out for another repo, please let us know.\n\nHave a great day!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888987d87c82a953:0x414ff0d625d0620b"}
