Let's all remember the employees deserve our appreciation & patience during busy shopping times...and they don't make more money during those times, just more stress while the corporate folks take in the sales profits. Just try to treat everyone with the same respect you would like to receive from them.  And Academy employees deserve raises & more hired staff to create a sales team force!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c40d19dfb2d:0x98f12f478f5c3c31"}

I needed to purchase some steel stakes to secure palm trees that are damaged from the storm. I went to the Montgomery Academy Sports Store and purchased these stakes. I talked with the salesman in the back and notified him of our mission and asked him if they could give us some kind of discount and was told no. I asked him to ask the manager and he did and the manager said no. When checking out of the store the manager was up front chit chatting with an employee and a customer ( doing nothing) and I again asked him face to face if he could help us out and he again said no. All the other companies have been good about discounting supplies. Lowe's of Wetumpka,  Marvins in Millbrook,  Harbour Freight,  Home Depot all have been helpful especially Lowe's in Wetumpka. After being told no face to face I told him I appreciated it and then proceeded to name the other companies that have responded responsibly.

I just went online ordered a pair of shoes stated I could pick up at the store within the hour. I received a call from the store that they didn\u2019t have my item and that it would be best if I canceled my order. That my money hadn\u2019t been taken out of my account. I tried to cancel online but it kept freezing up. I called the corporate customer service waited on hold for over 30 minutes and then they cut my call off. I then called the Decatur store back and ask for a manager. The girl that answered said \u201c I\u2019m a manager\u201d she was short and rude with me . Said they would cancel my order and I would get a email or text when it was taken care of. I did receive it and it stated my money would not be back in my bank account until 7 business days. So isn\u2019t that great!! Academy ruins a Christmas present for my daughter. And has not a second thought or concern for me . I tried to do the right thing order from home social distance for everyone\u2019s safety and this is the thanks I get. I paid for an item last spring $ 700 and basically the same thing happened only difference is they didn\u2019t have my purchased item so I had to buy a $100 higher item of the same kind. I guess you make so much money that I make no difference. So I am sure I won\u2019t be missed. But very poor service and no compassion for taking someone\u2019s money at Christmas..
