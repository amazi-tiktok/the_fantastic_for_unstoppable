I asked around, got bids from 3 contractors and decided on Thompson - professional, price competitive, responsive - all the things I was looking for.  Immediately upon signing, I was given the nam of our  Project Manager and he held our hand guiding us throughout the lead-up and then the actual installation day.  I have never seen a crew so large yet so professional in my life and was impressed to say the least. 07h30 they were at the door and by 16h30 we had a beautiful new roof, the site was carefully \"policed\" for stray nails and other detritus and they were gone.  The next day Keith (our PM) came back to make sure things were done as he expected followed by our original \"salesman\" (that term is so inadequate) Kyle coming out the following day to walk the roof and the grounds and write up a final \"punch list\".  And within 24 hours we had been visited once again this time by a small set of the original crew who knocked out the punch list items in under and hour and then were gone again.
