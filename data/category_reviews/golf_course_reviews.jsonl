We set up a tee time the day before for Saturday. We traveled about 40 mins to the course. It was right off the highway into a gated golf community. Right from the start we were greeted by the staff. Upon entering the clubhouse, I was amazed at the initial set up of the course. My co-worker had to rent some clubs, at which they were very accommodating by giving him a brand new set of Nike Vapors. I had the Coverts 2.0 from the previous year and was impressed at the rentals they provided. We went to the driving range and then the putting green and we were off. Long story short, the course was AWESOME and the view was even better. We found ourselves stopping to take pictures and taking in the view (Which I rarely do on course). What I thought was to be a 6 hr round (because of our relax play at each hole) was a little over 4 hrs. This course is in my TOP 5 best courses I've played in my life, (I've played in the range of 50-60 different courses). I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys a challenge, but also a forgiving course layout. The scenic views are something out of a movie which as to the relaxation of the game of golf. If you are ever in the area, you have to check out this course.\n\nA big Thank You to the staff there at Cherokee Ridge who were some of the top notch personnel a course can have.

It was her holier than thou attitude that made them mad.

This is more of a story of how she can attempt to extract extreme compensation for the threat of a bad review.  From the moment speaking with Alexis on the phone the conversation quickly became \"what kind of compensation will you give me??\"  Meaning she wanted me to refund over $ 160.00 in greens fees because of her threats of a poor review.   I went out to the course and spoke to the gentlemen about the incident.  They were delayed only 5 minutes from their tee time.  My worker could have had a cooler head dealing with customers, but an apology was made and the men appeared to be happy that I looked into the situation. I offered to buy them a round of beers as a friendly gesture.   I am more than willing to accept a one star review than cower to a person trying to extort money in lieu of a bad review.

At one time, one of the top courses in the state, and certainly my favorite.  Played today for the first time in a while, and although the course is nice, it is NOT the experience and condition that it once was.  It appears that they are working hard, but the edges are a bit rough.  Greens good, but slow.  Carts have been allowed to go almost anywhere.  It's a bit like the local good ol' boys have taken over.  I played behind 4 groups of 5 apiece, playing their own ball.  Took about 4:40 to play 18 as a single.  No chance of playing through or an offer to.  Should not have 5somes.  Staff was nice, decent food.  Fortunately,  I came on a Monday for a $50 rate.  If it was weekend it would have been $90!  Tough to justify driving an hour from Hoover.  I will play here again, but not motivated to try again quickly.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889986f224015ed:0xbf2b1e52ec96fa35"}

So then what about the better courses? There are no options for more stars if we're comparing golf course to golf course...\n\nThis is my first time playing this course. I figured after all the \"great\" reviews, I'd try it out. One word: disappointment. I found this course on GolfNow for $40 for morning rounds and $26 for afternoon rounds. I booked my tee time on their last-updated-2012 website and it said $35. I don't know why it would be more on GolfNow...\n\nAnyways, I guess if you didn't include the cart, it would be a decent price for the golf course. It's a nice golf course to just mess around and start learning golf. I can see myself having fun if I'm messing around with my friends trying to outdrive each other over a beer or two... But I don't know if I can take this course too seriously.\n\nThe pro shop employee wasn't really all that friendly either...no good morning, no welcome.... Just a sign here and an 'appreciate it'. Maybe it was too early in the morning for him.\n\nGreens consistently have ball marks. They're pretty fresh too so I'm assuming the management doesn't enforce this. I must've repaired 3-4 per hole until I got fed up with it by hole 7.\n\nThe distances seem inconsistent...so maybe a calibration is needed?\n\nThe course lacks creativity, the greens are inconsistent, some are dying, more pot holes on paths than the NJ Turnpike, bare ground everywhere near greens and tees. Yeah....i don't know if I'm coming back and paying as much as I did to play here. The Robert Trent Jones golf course is about $20 more on GolfNow deals...\n\nLike I said in the beginning, it's a 2-star golf course. I don't know what people review for, but I tried to mix both experience and the golf course itself.\n\nSorry Jimmy, I don't know where you see the great condition on this course...", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoJIgvMmyn63BxOgf2bgFFg0UKr-iBo9NBB0pZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfDM_94-jp4PlrdD2AC17C25RcbUf163q4qlUV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMx_RscR9qvle_e1bFi3BKpf5HpdJQjFMNNZcZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1h1cgZwTJ3mtQbunR56gjt11qSf6pq-B_fKZr=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlv_N2H2N5z-qkvlu63kpeeWiybiykrKs8f7Kh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQHW5FoN9m7XWVceWTwhoh7cnLUWKn6xz60jSa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cd3e7063721:0xc6ec39c736319a86"}
