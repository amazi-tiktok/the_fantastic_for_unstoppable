We are glad that you are satisfied with the work we did on your buildings exterior, windows, and concrete. The rest of the review isn\u2019t as accurate. You contacted us yesterday morning demanding that we come immediately to put dirt back around  bricks that you asked us to clean. The 2-3 inches of dirt that was \u201cremoved\u201d was against the 2-3 inches of brick that you wanted cleaned on your patio. Meaning in order to clean your bricks, we would have to clean the dirt off that was against them. After you told me the problem, which was two days after we completed the project, I informed you that I would get by there to attempt to fix the issue even after knowing we did nothing but do our job. You hung up in my face immediately after me telling you that I couldn\u2019t come in that very moment because we had work going on at the moment, and I like to finish jobs before I move on to something else. It would be very unprofessional of me to leave a customer\u2019s house who paid in advance before I finished their property. Your call was at 10:44 a.m. and you left this review at 11:02 a.m., meaning you left this review before anything could be done to resolve the issue. It was a pleasure doing business with you from start to finish and this review is not an accurate depiction of our experience together. We have worked extremely hard to have a 100% satisfaction record. We have over 100 five star reviews between google and Facebook and have never received anything less than a 5 star in our 4 years of business. We hope to do business with you again one day.

They pressure washed both driveways, some areas of the house, back patio and everything else that needed it.  Here is the reason they have my highest and best recommendation - I needed Richard to clean some streaking off the gutters - he was very honest and told me what he thought he could do and told me that it might not work.  In the end, it worked perfectly and the gutters are almost good as new.  Also, the crew came back a 2nd day and I could tell that maybe the job was larger than first anticipated so I asked Richard to bill me more and he wouldn\u2019t do it - he stood by his estimate and that means a lot.  I ended up adding some money to what I paid because he is the kind of business owner that goes above and beyond to satisfy and is a man of his word.  I love paying honest professionals for great work - you won\u2019t go wrong choosing Richard and I Need Pressuring Washing.  Enjoy your clean, like-new, pressure-washed areas - I know we are enjoying ours!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1560437973433, "text": "Joseph, I can't thank you enough for such an amazing review.

Avoid this poor businessman and his threatening demeanor.  Sad, because he does good work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1523654466398, "text": "Dr. Caldwell,\nI have been thinking a lot about our conversation on Friday and wanted to contact you in hopes of clearing the air between us. I want to start by  apologizing for my part in the direction the messages went. We pride ourselves on stellar customer relations with the main goal being 100% customer satisfaction. As you know, It\u2019s a huge accomplishment in today\u2019s world for a customer to have such confidence in your work that they ask you to return time and time again, therefore I want to express my gratitude to you and Mrs. Caldwell for your loyalty in years past.\nI truly believe that the end result of our conversation on Friday was caused by a breakdown in communication. We all know the numerous ways that communication via text/email can be misunderstood, which is why i try to speak directly with my customers as often as I can. Unfortunately, this is not always possible for me because, as you\u2019ve experienced in years past, we are a small operation and I am present on every project that we complete. That customer is paying for my time and in return, 100% of my focus is on providing them the quality they deserve. While this is fortunate for the customer, it is generally unfortunate for me as well as the potential customers that are in line or have needs that have yet to be met. I can assure that we are constantly looking for ways to improve and already have taken steps to circumvent these obstacles. With that being said, I would like to respectfully respond to your complaints and share with you a few steps we are taking in the evolution of our company.\n\n- We have recently transitioned over to a new database setup in order to submit estimates, send invoices, schedule projects, send out reminders, etc. We will be reviewing the frequency of emails being sent very closely in the coming weeks and months to ensure no one is \u201cspammed\u201d. Until now our main focus in that area has been that our firewalls and malware are more than sufficient to keep our customers\u2019 information safe.\n- This is the first time it\u2019s happened, but your request for proposal slipped through the cracks with this new system we are implementing. I will not allow any potential customer, especially repeat customers, to have to wait 9 days to receive an estimate. Again, one of the kinks we are working out. I was attempting to remediate this by telling you that I would be giving estimates the following day (due to the threat of severe weather we had to cancel a large commercial job) and would be certain to get you a proposal.\n- Meanwhile, In an attempt to be as open as possible about scheduling the potential work, I simply stated that we currently have a 2 week lead time from proposal acceptance to work completion. I let everyone know how long it could be before I start because EVERY CUSTOMER is equally important to us, and we schedule work on a first come, first serve basis.\n- There is only one other exterior cleaning company in Tuscaloosa that operates on the level that we do (experience, revenue, insurance coverage, etc.) and, as you can imagine, \u201cSpring Cleaning\u201d is our busiest time of the year. As of today, both companies have a lead time of 3+ weeks from proposal acceptance to project completion. It is against our policy to offer discounts simply because we are not willing to move someone to the front of the line, just as you wouldn\u2019t appreciate someone being placed in front of you.\n- We do not, & have never, paid for membership into a \u201ccontractor referral\u201d website, such as homeadvisor.com. Instead, we choose to rely on other methods of advertising while also investing a large portion into additional certifications, continuing education, etc. We are glad that you were able to find another contractor so quickly through home advisor and wish you all the best in dealing with that contractor. I would love the opportunity to speak with you personally and more in depth on this matter. Please send your contact info to andy@alabamaprowash.com.

The only places I saw any kind of debris were some spots under the seats that would require removing the seat in order to clean and that is unrealistic. The wash, wax, and wipe down of everything was nicely done. The seats were shampooed and the cleaning of the seats were great but I would suggest getting a plastic film to put on the seats in case they are still damp. Mine were slightly moist (which I understand they won't completely dry in 4 hours) and when I got home my clothes were also a little moist but this isn't a rating breaker for me. I have a white dog that sheds a lot so I was impressed that they were able to clean the car well enough to where I only saw a couple of straggler hairs around the car.

The interaction that you have detailed is very contrary to what our records indicate. While our technician did arrive late due to some issue with our equipment, he in fact communicated same.  At the time, you indicated that, that was in fact ok.\nWhenever we engage prospective customers whether over the phone or in person we always go over their expectations i.e. what they want cleaned and how they would like to see it look. We are then able to guide their expectations based on our own expertise. In your interaction with our technician, Martez, he indicated that your home was in fact badly oxidized and that with pressure washing it may become more evident in some parts than others. He further explained that oxidation is not caused by pressure washing  but in your case it was because of aging paint.  At the end of the service, you indicated that everything was in fact 5 star quality and you did leave a 5 star review to indicate such. It is therefore, quite unsettling that weeks later, you would call making such accusations about our professionalism and conduct thus purposely defaming our company.\nWith that said, we cannot stand responsibility for an issue for which our workman was not culpable. We are truly sorry that we were not able to come to an amicable resolution."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889216488f741b5:0xae1f6de8dd01618d"}

They called me back on the 17th to inform me that a technician would be at my house on the 18th (Saturday) to gather the information needed for the quote. On the 18th of Apr, I received a text stating the technician would not be out to my house until the following Monday. No biggie.  Well Monday came and went, same for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday as well. On Friday (24th of April 2015), I called to see why they had not informed me of the quote and if this is the way they normally treat potential customers. The young lady who answered informed Rebecca ( her customer service skills are lacking, will explain in a few) and she tried to tell me they had called me that week as well as emailed me the quote. I tried to inform her I had not received the call and even scrolled back through my call log to ensure I had not missed their call, well no call logged. Next, Rebecca said  had talked to Mark and they were going to pass on my doing business with me and that they had emailed my quote earlier that week to an email address in which she read to me. While I was attempting to tell her THAT WAS THE WRONG EMAIL ADDRESS, and reason I never received the quote, she with an attitude said , \"Have a nice day\" and hung up on me.   Now, due to their errors/mistakes, whatever you want to call it, they have LOST a potential repeat client. I will gladly take my business somewhere else. They are RUDE, HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS AND I GUESS CANNOT TAKE GOOD NOTES and I GUESS THEY BELIEVE THEY DO NOT NEED NEW CUTOMERS. If that is the case good for them, but given the fact they had incorrect information and tried to blame me the customer, I would not do business with them EVER.  P.S. I even replied to the text they sent me, to inform them they had sent the quote to the wrong email address (they left out 2 key pieces of the email addy), yet to receive A REPLY, I guess they think they don't make mistakes.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1429907380627, "text": "We take great pride not only the quality of our work but our outstanding customer service.

Rebecca did call a couple days after the quote was sent but was unable to reach him. When Mr Davis called today he was very upset and unpleasant.

The front-end still had smashed insects and debris on it that easily came off with my fingernail. That lead me to look even closer. Using a flashlight, I noticed quite a few areas where wax was never removed, where hopefully condensation, and not unrinsed soap, dripped down, leaving behind hazy but obvious lines across the paint. The interior of my vehicle was outstanding, with the exception of the entire front winshield being ignored and unclean. I am just disappointed.

First, you play phone tag with a person for a day then they want to come and measure each square foot of carpet to be cleaned which required me to drive 30 miles to the home,which in the end was a waste of time.

Charging attorney fee rates is ridiculous, you're cleaning carpet for 2 or 3 hours without going to law school for 6 to 8 years. In my opinion he just didn't want to do the job. Also wanted like $1.15 a sq. ft to clean tile with over 500 ft. to be done. Again, it ain't that difficult and those prices must be from New York or Cali.

We accessed all of their cleaning tools which included a complete cleaning of every surface from top to bottom (even windows inside and out), Heavens Best Carpet Cleaning, and the ionization odor removing process. Courtney went above and beyond to make sure our house was sparkling clean and fresh and ready to put on the market! I can\u2019t say enough about these wonderful ladies!\nIf your looking for an honest and thorough cleaning service for a great price look no further than Clean Supreme!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572778885227, "text": "Thank you Ms. Pollie for allowing us to be of service."}, "gmap_id": "0x88625d3acc71b423:0x5172f4b3722d6eba"}
