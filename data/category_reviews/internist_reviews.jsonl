Or since your all about asking questions why didn't you ask if there was another alternative for you since you were breast feeding. Make sense huh!!!! I could go on and on about the ignorance of people to right reviews because they didn't get there way. If you don't like what a Doctor recommends for you by all means find a new Doctor that more fits you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926c244efada5b:0xfa1ff97768a2db3f"}

Writing a review about him not refilling your prescription based only on your \"word\" that pills were stolen from your pill bottle is quite RIDICULOUS! There are rules and regulations that ANY doctor has to follow.Just because you said someone stole them does not mean it is true. (If it was true I am truly am sorry for you.) But once again that is not the Doctors fault and should not have to feel that it is. He has a family to take care of at home and he should not have to and will not have to put his career and income on the line for you. Also if the doctor was the one that asked all the questions why should he pay a nurse to do it?? THAT IS WHAT HE HIRED HER/HIM FOR.  He has a Nurse to get your info, symptoms, and general questions and concerns relays these things to the doctor and he comes in recommends what you need and gets you ready to go.

When I reach out to the office next day to let them know and to voice my concerns on her condition, not once but three times in the same week. I never got a response or a call back from Dr. Foster or her nurse until the third time I called very annoyed that her nurse nor Dr. Foster had called to even check on my elderly grandmother after being in the hospital. Then when Dr. Foster did return my called she set the tone at the beginning of the call with a sister girl attitude which was very unprofessional of someone who is a physician.  You try to patronized black medical doctors, but they don't always provided you with the same experience and level of professionalism of another race. When I explained to her my concerns she was very non-chalant showing no emotional as to the pain and agony my grandmother has been enduring for a week now. The she stated she never got my messages in which I had left several time during the weeek and it displays the unprofessionalism of her office staff which some of her office staff is family and close friends working for her, so that goes without saying the office is very unorganized, unprofessional and incompetent.

Never mind in Texas with my  primary care doctor I was able to get prescription refills without ever having to see such a doctor.

Well as in any place you live there are many good things and there are not so good things that you experience.  We just came across a not so good thing and that is the Alabama Medical Group, P.C.  We were only with this PCM and the medical group for 3 or 4 months when we received in the mail a letter from them dismissing one of my family members.  The letter did not state any reason why only that they \u201cneed to do this from time to time.\u201d  When asked why our family member was dismissed their representative would not provide a reason and on top of that they were rude during our phone conversation.  As a Navy Captain (retired) who has been to many places in this world along with my family who have been with me through all of that,  this has been the most disappointing experience of my career and was upsetting for my family members.  As a result of this,  my entire family has now changed PCMs.  I hope this feedback will help the management of Alabama Medical Group to self reflect and make some changes for the better.

Instead of this \u201c Nurse Practioner\u201d listening to the severity of my symptoms and etc she wrote me for a med, said this is for anxiety and just as good as the Xanax.... IT WAS AN ANTIHISTAMINE!  Wow!!!! They treat patients as idiots!  Just bc people abuse drugs don\u2019t give them the right to judge as they did me and highly discriminated me.  When try to talk to her all she done was smirked and showed no interest of the severity of my problem!!! That\u2019s how people end up dead so to suicide a lot of times is bc no one cares, starting with healthcare! I begged her to please go speak with the Dr a quick sec for me bc for me, yes it was an emergency but no. U will have to schedule make another copay and so on. Mental health facilities are supposed to care but since drug addiction is bad in the WHOLE world, you will be judged. I hope they improve somehow bc I paid copay to be gave suedafed. Ridiculous!  If I didn\u2019t have a chronic lifelong problem, I sure would not of went to a Psychiatrist!!! With over 9 years of records in hand proving all my facts she still didn\u2019t care!! Thanks Kendrick for judging this woman and discrimination against me.  Good news travels but bad news travels faster.  As far as Keith, I have nothing bad to say about him.  He did understand not just medicate, he understood!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1593016959069, "text": "Good Morning, I believe  you have reviewed the wrong practice.

None of the medicine has helped.\n\nUPDATE: This post is from 3 days ago. I called TWICE yesterday about the same referral. I was told I would get a call back, apparently my referral was transferred to a different Dr in their office. Still no call back; I called back again to get the voicemail.\nISO new primary care physician", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

The only way to get them is when you actually see the doctor.. if you forget to get a refill when you see the doctor well your screwed until the next month basically. We live about a hour away from there so we can not just go by there everyday trying to get one refill. Today I called about a refill and have been trying to get this refill now for over a week and eventually instead of helping me they hung up on me. I just am beyond aggravated. My mom really likes her dr and his nurse is so sweet, but it's getting to the point that I'm seriously considering finding her another doctor bc of the fact everything about the front desk is just so unprofessional. When we gofor my mother's appt I'm going to complain about this and try to get a number that is a direct line to my mom's Dr or his nurse.

After my current pediatrician, Dr. Rivas, advised it was time to transition to an adult provider. During the time he was my provider, Dr. Ginevan worked alongside my psychiatrist to continue maintenance of my ADHD and when necessary, he worked with specialists to manage my delicate GI condition. This included references to appropriate clinics and scheduling of applicable tests ie. Colonoscopy, EGD, etc. I truly trusted Dr. Ginevan and was incredibly grateful to have found such a wonderful physician. I never minded the fact that his office was always moving locations or that his appointments had become a nightmare to secure. I still referred only my closest of friends and family to see him. Always assuring them they'd be nothing less than satisfied with him as they're provider. Those were the old days... in 2013 I moved away to live on base with my then husband. I moved back in 2015 and returned to Dr. Ginevan. He and his staff had undergone a complete restructuring as they were now a part of the mega-merger trend and had merged with the tri-cities health giant Shoals Primary Care LLC. Due to the merger Dr. Ginevan no longer had any of my previous medical records from all of my time spent under his care which led to massive complications to my continuity of care. (I now understand the importance of my responsibility to secure medical history documentation and maintain my own current updated personal medical record.) Also, SADLY, due to the implementation of a governmental-esque standard of operating procedures, it is my opinion that Dr. Ginevan no longer maintained the level of patient care he had became known for. His office staff has always been grade-A; to be commended. If you are considering seeing Dr. Ginevan as your primary care provider this review is for you. In closing I want to say that this review in no way, intends to slander or cause malice. This review is my personal experiential reference/opinions of Dr. Ginevan meant solely for the purpose of socially informing fellow peers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

I ignored that fact and still decided to give the doctor the benefit of the doubt because I could understand things sometimes happen. However, upon my scheduled visit as a first time patient it was for 7:30 am, and I arrived at 7:15 am for new patient paper work. I signed in and no one even showed up at the front desk until my appointment time, where I  then asked for my paper work and filled it out. About ten minutes after that, another woman called me by the wrong name and when I corrected her, I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong. Also, you can not hear when you are being called because the TV is loud, so people are talking over the TV, and I have two ear infections. After filling out my paper work, I was then called back to the window, where I was asked to write down my SSN, but I had already written it down twice on the form already. This told me they obviously were not paying attention to the information they were entering. After this, and already feeling on edge from just the front desk experience, I am called back by the doctor's nurse practitioner who tells me to step on the scale, and with a horrible tone says, \"you're going to have to take some of that off.\" Meaning my purse. I ask where I should put it in case of a designated area, which seem to make her even more annoyed and she replies with, \"I don't know.\" Very snappy. I am a new patient and felt like I was asking a very simple and non offensive question. We then walk to the exam room where she informs me that I would not be seeing the doctor and that he also would never been doing my exams or ever seeing me other than a quick peek in the room. Which, as someone looking for a long term doctor, it does not feel comfortable not even meeting my doctor on the first visit. When I tried to explain that I was uncomfortable with the fact she would only be relaying my issues to the doctor, and that I didn't feel comfortable having my health looked after in third person, and that I didnt understand why they wouldn't tell a new patient to begin with when making an appointment that he or she won't be seeing a doctor. She then got upset about it and told me I could reschedule or abort because she had been doing this for 40 years. Which is fine and I explained to her I was fine with her seeing me, but that I didn't feel comfortable having a doctor diagnose me without speaking with me and knowing me as a person. She gets more upset and I said I think it would be best just to cancel because at that point, being someone who has been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, I was overwhelmed and ready to go home. She proceeded to then say to me, \"Fine then. Adios.\" I feel as if the entire situation was unprofessional on many different levels. I decided to keep searching for a new doctor. I would not advise this practice if you want to get to know your doctor for long term use, or have anxiety issues, seeing as how it is the only doctor's office I have ever been in where the lobby is loud and over packed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

We share your feelings about the labs.  Just to clarify, in most cases, as in your case, we review our patient's lab results as quickly as we can, almost always within a couple of days of our receipt of the data.  Then, if the patient requests that we we do so (and not every patient desires that we do), we will share the results on the portal, where they can be seen by the patient directly.  Exactly how the results are displayed on the portal, however, depends upon how the lab sends us the results.  If the lab provides results to us in a structured, computer-friendly format (which we prefer), they will appear in the \"lab\" section; on the other hand, if we receive them via fax, we will forward those pages to the patient in PDF format, which can be viewed on the portal as well, in the \"messages\" section.  We agree it would be much better if every lab provided their results in structured format, but not all lab vendors are doing that just yet.  We are working hard with our lab vendors to make that a reality, and have been for some time.  We expect that in the very near future, virtually all of our patients' results, including labs drawn here at the office, will be received in a structured way (and, in turn, passed along to the patient that way).  We would like to make things as easy and intuitive as possible, and we agree that would help.

Some day soon, they will.  We give each of our patients all of the time they need, and we can only hope that you and your husband have felt that.  We strive to get the right care to the right patient at the right time, and for that reason we have two other providers in our practice at present, an NP and a PA.  They are both quite skilled at treating complex patients, but they naturally tend to see patients for visits that are less complex on average than those handled exclusively by the doctor, and so for some patients there are many times that they may offer a more efficient healthcare encounter.  Consider visiting one of them in the future, and we believe you will find it to be a pleasant experience that you may even prefer.  Every patient will be seen by the doctor periodically as well, and the doctor is always available when necessary.  With respect to the question regarding a return call, we wouldn't want to discuss the specifics of a particular patient's situation in a public forum; however, if there were an urgent matter, we would ask that in the regrettable event that you don't hear back from us promptly, that you simply reach out to us again to check on the status of the issue and to reiterate the urgency of the matter; if there were to be a medical emergency, we would recommend that you seek care at a hospital emergency department and call an ambulance if necessary.

We believe you bring up an important point that we would like to highlight.  It\u2019s true that patients sometimes have a wait to see their doctor or practitioner, and we take no pleasure in it when a patient is upset.  We would respectfully disagree, though, that this is due to a lack of regard for our patients\u2019 time.  In fact, we see it as quite the opposite.  We take our time with our patients.  Most patients have many questions, each of which deserves respect, and we strive to consider each one thoroughly at the time it is asked, rather than asking the patient to arbitrarily pick just one or two and return for yet another appointment at another time to handle the rest, which would delay care for weeks or months and require another trip to the office (and possibly another copayment).  We document the decisions we make together in a thoroughly detailed manner, often in the presence of the patient, which takes some time but improves the quality of care and communication.  We also care for our own patients in the hospital, which makes care in the hospital more safe, comfortable, and efficient. (This also means that the first patient in the office on a given day is probably not the first patient of the day overall.)  Whenever possible, we address routine screening and wellness concerns at each visit, so the patient does not have to wait until the annual \u201cwellness\u201d or \u201cphysical\u201d visit to receive that care; whenever appropriate, depending on the medical situation, we may perform that service on the same day as a visit for specific medical problems, to save the patient some time; the total cost to the patient is the same, and in some cases the total reimbursement to the practice is less, but most importantly the patient doesn\u2019t have to make an extra trip to the office.  We acknowledge that life is full of trade-offs, and some of the ones we choose to make at our practice have occasionally resulted in wait times longer than we would like.  We are continuously working to improve that, and we are absolutely confident that we will as our systems and workflows improve, but the truth is that the vast majority of our patients believe that it has been worth it, and we would agree with them.  We have tremendous respect for our patients, their time, and their concerns, and we are proud to provide medical care in a way that we are confident reflects that respect - even if it\u2019s necessary to wait at times to experience it.  We consider it a privilege to care for you as our patient and hope to see you again soon."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621310f9455325:0x5c077b603254c00e"}

Office and his nurse said the dr. Added these labs and she said they have been having problems with insurance companies not covering them. I asked her why the dr.

They called him and asked for the diagnostic codes and he refused to give them the codes saying there were no other codes that can be given. Well I think the insurance company would know if there were no other codes or not. Anyway I called the dr.

We are generally meticulous about discussing each diagnostic test that we order with each patient, and the reason for doing so. That's important, in part, for this very reason - we can never know with complete certainty what an insurance company may or may not cover. And, of course, our medical decisions are made, first and foremost, with the good of the patient in mind; whether the insurance company decides to cover them, while important, is a secondary consideration. Medical decisions are made between the patient and the doctor, and no one should come in between that sacred bond. There are various different reasons that a test might be felt to be indicated - sometimes to evaluate an active problem, and other times to screen for a potential problem - and the tests and treatments we select are generally chosen according to scientific evidence and/or according to the clinical guidelines that define the standard of medical care in our country. The \"codes\" are used to communicate the reasons for tests to the insurance company; sometimes there is more than one code that could be used for a given test for a given patient (because there may be several reasons a test is ordered at a certain point in time), and other times there is really only one code that is appropriate. Some tests the insurance company may decide that they will never cover, and others they may cover only for certain reasons (which can change without notice). If they choose not to cover a test, it's usually not so much because the \"wrong\" code was sent, but rather because they have chosen not to cover that test for the reason it was ordered. If we can ever provide them other reasons, or codes, that weren't submitted at first because the first set of reasons sent seemed to the doctor to be an adequate explanation, then we will send those additional codes. But sometimes, all of the reasons we supply just aren't enough to get the insurance company to cover the test. Sometimes there are other codes that might get them to cover the test, but these aren't really the \"right\" codes unless they actually apply to the reasons the test was ordered for that patient at that time. We understand you are upset, and we understand why. But we would respectfully suggest that your concerns about lack of coverage are better directed to your medical insurance plan, which may have a different idea of \"medical necessity\" than your doctor, and we would further respectfully suggest that you consider that your doctor is the one that defines medical necessity, and that while the doctor has nothing to gain from ordering more tests, the insurance company could potentially have something to gain from declining to pay for some tests. We stand behind the reasons we order all of the tests we order, and the reasons are quite thoroughly documented in each patient's medical record, and we refuse to let another entity dictate to us what is appropriate for our patients.  We strive to review all the tests ordered and their reasons, but there is a lot that goes on during medical appointments, particularly ones that are conducted in-depth as ours are, and while we also work to ensure that the patient understands very well the plan of care, it's quite a lot to ask the patient to also remember every last test ordered and the exact reason why. While it would be great if the patient could remember all of that, that's really more the job of the doctor to take care of that in the medical record. If we failed to mention a test and the reason for it, we certainly wish to apologize. We would just ask you to consider the possibility that all of the tests ordered may have been discussed with your wife, and perhaps she was understandably more focused on the problem that was bothering her than on all of the screening tests that were also being ordered as part of a comprehensive visit. We consider it a privilege to care for our patients and will do whatever we can to be of service."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621310f9455325:0x5c077b603254c00e"}

Upon making an appointment this week, I hoped that things would be different. They were.....somewhat. I made an appointment for 8:00 in the morning and arrived at 7:40 or so to fill out any necessary paperwork. The front desk staff was friendly and courteous. About 8:05 I was called to the back and thought, \"this is going great so far\".  I was then informed that Dr. Davidson normally doesn't arrive until 8:45-9:00 or so. What in the ever-loving hell!!? Why would anyone make appointments beginning an hour before the doctor arrives? I'm not sure if this is an issue with the scheduling staff or the doctor himself but I find it highly unacceptable. Time is valuable for anyone. They sure wouldn't wait for a patient to be an hour late for the appointment, why should I wait for him? I want to stress that even while listening to my short rant about how F'ed up the situation was, the staff remained friendly and courteous. At least the clinic management has gotten the staff issues straightened out.
