I believed their reputation of being professional and accommodating being that my mom was so far away from home. My mother's transport and burial service went fine. But now, 6 months later, there is still no  headstone on my mother's grave. I've called several times in the last 5 months to ask when they would set the headstone.  Each time I'm either blown off, or made a very convincing promise that it will be taken care of right away. Nothing ever gets done. My family has gone through our first Holidays without my mom, and I'm sure Sunset Memorial has no concern about the numerous calls I get from upset family members that can't find her grave site when they go to visit her. Her birthday is coming up in 2 days, undoubtedly with the same result. No headstone in her memory. The last time I called a few days ago, I spoke to Ben (again) who made it a point to mention to me that \"they'd been busy\" (for 6 months, apparently), \"it's been raining\" (for 6 months, apparently), and he reminded me that they do the headstone \"free of charge\" (which I'm sure isn't accounted for anywhere in my $13,000 payment to them, made immediately and in full 6 months ago).  I deeply regret using Sunset Memorial for my mother's arrangements. She's laying in an unmarked grave, for 6 months now, and Sunset Memorial could care less. If you want people that truly care beyond when the check clears, take your loved ones elsewhere. I wish that I did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928e6ec6017ec5:0xa497d77cfeddbff6"}
