The rigorous academic courses, wide variety of sports, arts, and student government opportunities prepared them very well for college and life in general. Walking into the schools you quickly sense a positive atmosphere. Teachers, administrators and students want to be there and are confident good things are going to happen every day. The school board members serve for 5 years with no pay. Only people with a strong desire to keep improving schools would do such a thing. Our sons weren't all at the head of the class, but every one of them said they were well-prepared, and often much better prepared at the 4-year universities and 2-year community college they attended.
