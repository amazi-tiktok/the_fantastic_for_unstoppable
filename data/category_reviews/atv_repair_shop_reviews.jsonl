I tried to piddle with it but decided that I needed to let an expert handle it since water had gotten in the motor. I had some bad luck with previous PWC mechanics in the area so I was apprehensive. Fred at Advanced Watercraft took it in and diagnosed several issues. It was back running in a week. Me and my kids took it out the day we picked it up and by the end of the day it had taken on water again. WAIT! I know it sounds like they didn't fix it, but I took it back to Fred and AW- he was apologetic and accommodating. Turns out in addition to the items he had fixed, a previous mechanic had routed some water lines incorrectly and caused an additional water issue. Although it was not his fault, Fred insisted that he would fix the boat and he did it at no charge. This type of commitment to service is rare these days.

Joe was EXTREMELY gracious, knowledgeable, friendly and laid back - he's just like a longtime friend that you haven't seen in awhile!  We decided on a white Wolf, full face helmet and alarm system.  The purchase process was very smooth and easy.  Joe answered all our questions and concerns and assured us that delivery could be expected in a few days.  Sure enough, 4 days later we returned to pick up the Wolf - it was all prepared and ready to go - just as Joe assured us it would be.  My grandson was so excited!  After break-in, we returned the Wolf to Joe for fluid changes and adjustments and again had a most pleasurable experience; the maintenance took only a few minutes; Joe even provided my grandson with several shaded sun shields.  It is with a great deal of pleasure and considerable pride that I highly recommend KMG Powersports and Joe Berrer and his staff to any and all who are in the market for a powersport.

This ATV has no trouble pulling the 950 pound trail mower we use on the farm or putting that smile on your face at the end of a hard days work . The 570 has more than enough power for the tough jobs or excitement out on the trail. The best way to describe the Polaris 570 utility edition and Champion Powersports is simple.

Matter of fact the 4 bolts that attach the carburetor were barely  finger tight causing fuel to leak into my air filter chamber. I came home and took it back for another 6 to 8 weeks and had to go sit in the waiting room to have someone actually work on my unit.   A week later after finally picking up my Rancher it wouldn\u2019t crank. A friend told me about Powersports Service Center and  Chuck and the team were amazing. My unit was fixed in three days and the real problem was found and corrected immediately. My Rancher runs perfectly now cranking with the slightest touch of the starter.

The additional items and Alabama mandatory tire sales fee were the only charges the customer wasn\u2019t aware of. The customer was phoned to be informed, but didn\u2019t  answer the phone during the servicing, so that we could make him aware of the extra needed items.  When the customer arrived to pick up the unit, and was presented the repair bill, he was adamant that he wasn\u2019t going to pay for the extra items, so it was offered to remove the items and return his original equipment.  In the end the shop owner marked down the cost of the repair and the shop gave the customer a free tube to help ease the cost of the repair.

I purchased a Hammerhead 250ss go cart second hand and when I purchased it, it would turn over but not start. The owner said the he let the go cart sit up for a year, but it did run but was pretty sure the carburetor needed cleaning. I took it to Basch Brothers in Cullman, because this is where the cart was originally purchased. I told them that I wanted to get the carburetor cleaned  and to look over the go cart for anything else it needed. They called me the next day and said it had no compression. I told them that's odd because when I purchased the cart, I checked the compression and it was at 90lbs. They said I don't know what to tell you but we are only get 60lbs. AT this point I understood they didn't want to work on it and I picked it up and took it to Dr. Joe's in Ensley. They found the carburetor was gumed up and the vacuum line. They return the go cart to me  the next day completely fixed. The fee was only $115 and the work was completed quicker than I expected.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzoMQ-0Sn_gXDNSSlpFz_Ha1sQhTaLMw2IwJle=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891c245bbff6f3:0xee26e49d30554648"}

I asked that he put the good motor on the good bike. We had a gentleman's agreement that I would pay more than a thousand dollars, and that would include two new tires. After looking closer at the tires I had I found that I had two good tires between the two bikes. I tried calling to check on the progress on my bike, but wasn't able to speak with anyone. Phill, the owner tells me, when I went in to check on my bike, that they got trash in my carbs. He had the carbs off my bike and was supposedly cleaning them. When he called me and told me my bike was ready I picked it up and only two cylinders was firing, the clutch was slipping, and the carbs were pouring gas. I took it back  the same day under the 30 day warranty to have it properly fixed. When he called me that my bike was ready and I went to pick it up he tries to charge me another $350.00. I called the police out to try and get my bike, but they said they couldn't get invovled and I would have to pay the money or get an attorney. I didn't trust him to leave my bike any longer, so paid the money to get my bike. My bike is sitting in my yard with the carbs still flooding out. After more than $1,400 dollars spent and I still can't drive my bike. If you value your property, do not take it to Prattville power sports. I'm getting an attorney and going to court.\n\nToday June 4, 2019, I had the pleasure of meeting the new owners of Prattville power sports. I had bought a new battery from phill when he done the work on my bike. Today I found out that the battery he put in my bike wasn't the same battery he said he put in. That it was a cheaper version, but he charges me for the more expensive battery. The new owner pulled out the old bills and showed me the difference and then gave me the battery that I was suppose to have from the beginning. I now believe and tmhave complete trust in the new owners and plan to do my business with them now that I know phill is gone.

We discovered this maintenance was simply changing the oil and spark plugs which can easily be done by me for a material cost of $65.

More than likely fake accounts made to influence the rating on Google.  Look though the reviews of those with real accounts.\n\nWe had mixed experiences. It seems it depends on the mood of the sales folks if they want to be fair or try to score on a huge markup on a sale.\n\nYou will find \u201cinternet\u201d pricing on many of their products and that price seems fair compared to other shops. The problem is when they give you the \u201cout the door\u201d price you will see they jack up the \u201cfees\u201d to more than make up for that good price.\n\nThey matched another dealer on our first purchase.    When I wanted to buy a second machine they quoted almost $7,000 out the door on a $4,697 internet priced motorcycle with original msrp $5,299.   $1,700  in \u201cfees\u201d plus taxes.\n\nJust be aware of the hard sale tactics and watch the dealer fees.  They also want you to buy the massive markup warrantee and finance at 15-25%.  They actually don\u2019t seem to want cash sales.\n\nNeedless to say I drove over to Atlanta and I\u2019ve found several dealerships much easier to deal with.

THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN INEXPERIENCED CONSUMER!\n\nMy 20 year old son purchased a Rancher with accessories including snorkel kit with Bama Power Sports. The salesman asked the service manager if installing the snorkel kit would void the warranty, the service manager said he didn't know but not to worry about it. They would fix it if it messed up. So, it was not disclosed to him that by using the accessories he purchased it could potentially void his warranty. He was however told by the salesman, in front of two witnesses, that Bama Power Sports would warranty it for 1 year \"It doesn't matter if you set it on fire or run it into a lake, we will cover it\".  THEY SAID WHATEVER THEY THOUGHT HE WANTED TO HEAR TO MAKE THE PURCHASE.\n\nThe first time my son took his Rancher out he used the snorkel kit. It got water in it. He looked under the 4-wheeler and there was a hose unattached. Had to be a poor install since it was the first time my son took it out. Honda Warranty will not cover it, snorkel kit, makes sense. But now Bama Power Sports is denying the salesman ever said anything about a 1 year warrant to these kids. Now I know these kids do not know anything warranties so they did not make this statement up. Bama Power Sports allowed my son to leave there thinking he was completely covered and is now refusing to make things right. $1,800 repair.\n\nWe tried to negotiate some sort of deal with them to take partial responsibility but they refused to speak to our attorney or have their attorney speak to ours. We decided we didn't trust these people enough to even work on it. When we went to pick it up they brought it out in pieces on pallets. I just hope all the parts are there. We now have to take it to someone else to fix it.

Let me be clear, I\u2019m not upset that they wouldn\u2019t service my atv. I\u2019m upset that about 3 hours of my Saturday had been wasted and could\u2019ve been avoided by simply telling me their policy over the phone. And the fact that the lady acted as though I had wasted her time. When in actually I feel as though my time was wasted. I\u2019ve bought several parts and dealt with Bama Power sports service dept before this interaction with no problems whatsoever. Not to mention Bama Power Sports seemed to be thankful for my business. I\u2019ve never left feeling as though I wasted their time.

Long story short, they had my bike for exactly a month charged me almost 500 dollars for everything and on the ride home i had the same problem. Still popping and hiccups. Throttle response was great an more power but that's not why i brought it there. So i went home looked at the carbs and the funnel of the carb was cracked. Its suppose to be new parts. Took it back the next morning told him everything an showed him the crack his response \"how did you see that\". My opinion, if you have a real issue with your bike take it somewhere else, but if you need tires or something small, by all means go ahead. Once they fix this ill never go back for anything other than riding gear or the snack machine.

I had been having problems with finding someone to work on my bike.  I have a \u201995 Honda VT1100c Shadow.  No one wanted to work on it because of it\u2019s age & my regular mechanic had closed up shop.  When I spoke to, Ronnie I explained what I wanted him to do.  I asked him how long would it take to complete the job.  He told him that it would be two weeks.  I agreed to that.  He came out to my house in late July to pick up my bike & take it to his shop.\nI waited the two weeks & gave him al call.  He said that he was still working on another bike & he was waiting for parts to come in.  I said, that was fine, I can wait for a few more weeks.  Two more weeks came about & he still hasn\u2019t gotten to it.  So, I just gave up & bought another bike in September.  I finally got a call from him on October 10th & 12:38 pm.  He said that he got it done.  I called him back & asked him how much it was, he said the total was $865.44.   I told him I would have to pick it up in a month. He agreed.  When I got there on November the 23rd to pick it up, he had flattened the rear tire.  He said  he broke the valve stem.  He told me he was going to charge me $75.00 to replace the stem that he broke.  I then asked him if we could start it, he said again, no.  The bike did have to be bottle fed.  So, I took it home.  When I got home I bottle fed it, it wouldn\u2019t start.  I called him & he said that it ran when he had it.  So, I asked him if he could look at it & see if he could figure out what was wrong.  He said that it would be two weeks & he would get $80.00 an hour to fix it.  Keep in mind, I just gave him the previous day, $865.00 in cash.  So, I took the carbs back off.  The only thing he changed was the diaphragms. The main jets, slow jets all were corroded & stopped up. He had the float heights all off.  He even used rubber hose for fuel line.  I called him back to ask for half a refund on it. I called him out on what he did.  When I told him that the jets were filthy & the carb bodies were filthy he stuttered & then told me that I am not getting sh*t back and hung up.  I wouldn\u2019t let this man work on anything.  The review on here before mine had a bad experience & they were there when I picked up my bike.  If I could give it negative starts if I could. These pictures below show what I got for my money. You can see that the bottom of the carbs are green & the jets are old & stopped up.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOikOY_9uySYZgFYs1yCu1pjr8BZtBxgR0_EOs=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhLhKb5HMQDNeqRvZbtmc8KlHnW95v1eurcwvz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfYMTVub6Q4n1Pl1qjaSVW3wzgg-2EQdl5Gce=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOohWrBi_KZuuZs2rloW7fiD3qhVAPjuRE0JFjC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLu6wYyOwVVADFo8rLp4GUUTVDDZj5Ase2sJ2S=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB8ELRalR_eFBXcm4HlSFtTC2gO2l35PHpvTYa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU5e-7LjQrUBNqmroCXFgKbwERuAmEQZdOySBK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgVwuVEVgOaOQnwAqi7YlwXUGSHFWBUeoRahs-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnMu7Z4WXFhh-wL7F6MitbO42L2Uzj1C27niZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2NUFL7xZB2E2_ba96Ko7Bd0NJFJ8rZ-zubAh6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzMI0yG2lwNxnXx4ddN8XuxyydEnCmQ480LnZK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt40-BH5IeCZHmqv2sKSd2wkMdHtAiFDnYzG02=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889bfdd2f410caf:0xf666e3cabfd567f4"}

Big Mistake.  He charged us $3500 plus to fix it.  He was clearly aware that it had set up.  The first time we went to get it, It would not start and the lights wouldn't work.  He ask how long has this gas been in here. My husband said 7 years remember you were supposed to drain the tank for me.  He even wrote it sat up for 7 years on the receipt.  He painted the front  fender with paint that didn't match.  He put a used rear tire on it and called it a new one.  It had dirt and clay mud on it and the bike wouldn't start so where would the mud come from on a new tire? .  We left it with him for obvious reasons.  My husband ask him to replace the bushing in the handle bars since we were leaving it anyway.We paid him in the beginning to change the light covers.  He charged us twice the original one he ordered we found in the saddle bags.    My husband starts home on it today.  The brake light would not go off and the mirror was just spinning. You would think he would have saw that when replacing the bushing in the handlebars. My husband gets to Arab while driving the brand new war bonnet on the fender fell off.  Oil is leaking from a bike that he supposedly changed the oil and fixed the clutch on it.  We paid this man 3700 plus and he didn't take enough pride in his work to even wipe the dust off the bike.  I was using his shop rag to do that while we were waiting to get it running last week.  He literally took it out of my hand.  When I first met him i told my husband he seems like a good Christian person.  Boy was I wrong he might be a Christian.  I have no Idea but good is far from the truth.  We are very upset with the way we were ripped off.\nWe took our bike to another shop because it was obvious that Ronnie did not change the tires, the battery, fix the carburetor or anything we ask him and paid him to do. They could not believe that anyone would say the changed tires when they were literally rotten around the rim because it had set up for 7 years. He really screwed us out of 3700.00 He is a dishonest man. The Battery was 7 years old yet he said it was new.
