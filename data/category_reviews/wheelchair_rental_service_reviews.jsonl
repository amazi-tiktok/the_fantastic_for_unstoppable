As I walked in, there were 2 young girls behind the counter eating lunch. they looked up to see me walk in, and that was the extent of it..  didn\u2019t even acknowledge that I was there with a simple \u201chello\u201d or \u201ccan we help you?\u201d. I walked up to the counter and stood there waiting to be acknowledged so I could ask for assistance, and they just continued to eat and decided I was not worth turning around for.. so after a few moments I decided that this was their customer service at their best and I was just going to have to find it myself.. I finally found the crutches behind me near the entrance (couldn\u2019t see them as I entered the store) as I searched for the right size for my wife, I noticed the size I needed was not marked, but a pair that was in the \u201cadult\u201d slot with no indication of the size.. I finally got there attention by asking \u201ccan you tell me what size these are\u201d.. I guess they REALLY weren\u2019t concerned about me when she responded \u201coh those are $25\u201d. I said \u201cok.. but what size are these?\u201d She walked over and said \u201cwhat size do you need?\u201d I told her 5\u20195 (adult) she looked through them, I guess thinking I was too dumb and hadn\u2019t thought to do the same.. and said \u201cwe have some in the warehouse, but it\u2019s closed, but you can come back on Monday and get them\u201d.  I asked what about these that aren\u2019t marked (clearly looking like the size I needed) oh those are the display, again confirming that she could have the crutches for me on Monday. She was never in her reply\u2019s but I felt like I wasn\u2019t worth their time. I\u2019m a RN at a nearby hospital and you can be sure I\u2019ll be more than happy to pass along my experience with this DME store!

That is not the main issue in this case, however.  Being paid for the equipment is important to us but most importantly is the medical necessity for the items provided.  Medicare has specific guidelines that we must follow in providing equipment that is ordered and if we do not follow them, not only payment is not received but it opens us up to potential Fraud and Abuse issues with Medicare for billing items that the medical records do not support.  Our Store Manager, myself and another clinical person reviewed the records and documents we have received from the physician\u2019s office who is ordering the equipment and what we have so far, does not show medical necessity for the bed and chair.  We have asked for records that do support it and as of date, not received anything that does.  It is not our desire to withhold needed equipment from anyone who needs it, but we are compelled to follow established guidelines that support it which as of now, not supported by records in our possession.  We would be happy to schedule a meeting with the customer and/or yourself, if you are a designated representative, to provide a copy of the medical necessity requirements and discuss how the records we have compares to the requirements.  Please feel free to contact our local store and let us know when a good time would be.
