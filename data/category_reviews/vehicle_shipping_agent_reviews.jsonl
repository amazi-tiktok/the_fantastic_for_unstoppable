The tow truck the police called out to pick my truck were nice and quick, But when they asked where I wanted them to take it to, they seemed a little bit annoyed that I wanted it to go to my home, as I wanted to talk with my insurance agent first. I suppose they prefer taking them to their place or a body shop.\nWhen they unloaded my truck, a good bit of the plastic from the headlight and grill fell out on the tow truck, And the driver just brushed it off into my yard where my truck was sitting. I didn't think much of it, I'd just clean it up in the morning when I went out to take pictures to start working with my insurance.\nI talked to my insurance, They told me because it's a newer model truck,  That they would have someone from their salvage provider come pick it up, I believe it was 3 days later when I got a call from a lady from IIA or IAA, saying that she was about to be giving a driver the information to come pickup my truck and verified my address and the damages with me.\nNot too terrible long after I spoke with her and said ok to having another tow truck company come out, Joey actually called me when he was roughly 30 minutes away from my home to verify my address and that everything was ready to go. He showed up just as he said and came to the door and got me to explain why he was there, And actually gave me the rundown on the process of what would happen if progressive did or did not total my truck. I handed off my keys to him, He went and got  his truck from the street and backed it in to where he'd be able to load it up. Before he backed up into the location, he did ask me if I had septic in the area (I I didn't)  He said he always asks when he has to enter a yard,  Said he's never had a problem with accidentally finding a tank but really didn't want to have to make phone calls explaining a problem!  LOL!\nHe got down under my truck and did his work with some chains, Put it in neutral to wind it up his truck and chain it down. Now, this is where I became surprised,  He picked up every piece of plastic and debris that had come from my truck and put them in the bed. I never asked him to!\nI asked why he did and he said he wanted it to be just as if he and my injured truck were never there. I'm still amazed that there a people that have that mindset.\nWe talked for a few more minutes as he finished loading and chained my truck down, I asked where they were out of and he gave me a business card with everything on it. I'm in Chilton county, So it's not feasible for me to call a company that's an hour plus away,  But he told me that you have trucks all over the place at any given time, And to call if I needed help, That you might be right down the street!\nAs I said early on, I never thought that my best experience in this headache would have been the guy that picked up my truck and towed from my home to Progressive's auction yard. It ended up being totaled,  But I'm loving my new blue f150!\nThank you to Joey and Hank's!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580148883770, "text": "That is so amazing to hear, Brian!

I sat on the road for almost 6 hours with 3 kids.\nWhen I called the place in which my car was to be towed, they said it was never delivered.\nMy vehicle was still sitting on the road even after I was sent a text saying it would be picked up at 4:37-4:52, only it was moved about 600 feet to where we initially stopped. The kids built a pyramid of rocks while playing in the ditch, which was approximately 600 feet to where the car was. Which tells me they loaded it then put it back down.

First off its our vehicle and I\u2019ll call all I need to about it especially when instructed to do so by my insurance company. I was belittled and talked to rudely. Our company will not use them again. We also requested our truck be dropped off at home 3 miles from the accident. He said oh no let me take it to my lot so the insurance company will come out faster. Which we let him do and it cost us $2800.00 because they didn\u2019t come out faster and it sat there from 6/26-8/21. I\u2019ll say the lady in the office was always nice when I spoke with her but Jason who I believe is the owner has no customer service skills.
