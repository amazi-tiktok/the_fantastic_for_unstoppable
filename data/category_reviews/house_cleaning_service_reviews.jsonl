Don't bother hiring Merry Maids, unless you just want some stranger to come into your house, clean nothing and leave a note saying they're glad you hired them and welcome to your clean house.

I can assure you that everyone that commented below has no idea how Merry Maids construct there business. This is one of the hardest jobs I have ever had in my life. You clean any where from four to five houses daily. You work so hard to the point that when you get home you don't even have the energy to complete personal/simple tasks. Simply tasks like taking a shower, cooking and cleaning for you family or even going out to a movie with your kids. Its pretty sad how they treat there employees. At the time I lost over 50 pounds working so hard and became very sick. I also lost a love one and didn't even get any condolences from the owners of the company. When I was there they were barely paying minimum wage. A customer might pay $120.00 to get Merry Maids to clean there home. The person that has to go and clean your home will make about 20.00 to 25.00. I could take you any where from 3 to 4 hours to clean a home. To me that does add up compared to the work you have to do. If a customer calls and complains about there cleaning. Merry Maids would make the cleaning free for the customer. And the person that cleaned your home with get written up and wont get paid anything for cleaning your home and will have to go out and clean it again for FREE! Something about that just doesn't add up. This company is family owned so they only care about themselves and not there employees. There are so many other company's  that you can give your money to and they will do a much better job than Merry Maid!!!!  (Maid Pro, Two Maids & A Mop, The Maids, Office Pride, Hard Hat Cleaning, White Glove Cleaning Service, Denise Dollar Home Cleaning, Elite Cleaning Service, A-One Cleaning Service,  Imagann Cleaning Service, Housekeepers Inc., Maid Green Cleaning Service, etc.) All the above cleaning service listings are in your local area. You do not have to give you hard earned money to Merry Maids anymore. A company that cares for no one but themselves is a company waiting to fail.

When the ladies showed up they were nice and hard at work.  However, I was disappointed when they left. Not only did they not clean the LITTLE nook coming in from the garage leading to the kitchen because it counted as a separate living space (which would cost extra), there were some spots they clearly missed especially annoying since it was a \"deep clean\". Then they told me the cleaning would cost more than $250! That's a huge difference from what I was quoted and my house wasn't extremely dirty (I have another maid service I used once a month).  Overall, the maids are extremely nice and my house was left smelling wonderful but I wouldn't use them again unless I had time to clean more after they left and an extra $100 available for when they bait and switched the quoted price.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212c9d38d2c23:0x8192a9dcaad6f92b"}

I agree with Rupa Agrawal's review. At 1st I had no problem with my service but as I became a regular customer the service started to decline. I've had several housekeepers over my time with the company. I have always asked for just one housekeeper, which for the last 2 years I've had. Due to no fault of hers, she's been out sick for the past 6+ months and not able to come, so I asked for another permanent housekeeper because I don't like different people in and out of my house. Every time a new person comes my house has not been cleaned according to the checklist. I leave my clearning products because I don't like the company's products. There has been times that the bottles are not even open. They are to dust the blinds, dust the furniture, but if an area seems like it doesn't need dusting, or cleaning, even though it's on the checklist, it will not be done. We have a garden tub that is wiped out but not cleaned, you would think that if you're going to wipe the tub, although it should be cleaned, one would wipe around the tub. I can always tell that it has not been cleaned because there is dust and/or strands of hair.  Baseboards, \"Really,\" they are hit or miss. This morning I called in to inform the office manager, whom I have spoken with several times before, that I was not please with my service. The manager didn't like what I had to say, so she hung up the Phone on me. I have one word for this Company's, service and Customer Service \"TERRIBLE!\" If you're looking for a cleaning service, I would NOT reccomend this one!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1529327326464, "text": "After six years of regular service that you were happy with you left us a one star review.  We are sorry that your regular housekeeper was unable to clean for you. We are sorry that this was upsetting for you and understand that it was an inconvenience for you.  We tried to explain your regular housekeeper was diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy making it difficult for her to work.  We sent you some of our best cleaners as substitutes during this time but after each cleaning you were upset that it was not your regular housekeeper.  After each substitute you would pick apart the cleaning and ask for a new housekeeper saying it was not your regular person and you were unhappy with the work.  These were housekeepers who get rave reviews from their own regular customers!  We did everything we could to make you a happy customer including returning and re-cleaning any problem areas for free!  We did our best and we kept trying knowing that your regular housekeeper was doing well and within a few weeks was planning on returning to work.  We wanted you to be a happy customer again! The last time you called our office the phone log recorded an almost twelve minute call.  During this time you took your frustrations out on our office manager.  We had several employees in the office when you called and they could all hear your upset voice through the small speaker in the hand set since it was so loud.   She tried to understand your point of view and to help correct your concerns.   Twelve minutes is a long time to be chewed out and really it was not called for.  As the owner of the business I want to protect my employees and it is company policy that they don't have to tolerate verbal abuse. We will \"go to the moon\" for our customers and will always communicate in a professional manner but we need the same from you.  After a very long twelve minutes she needed to end the call.  The manager professionally told you she had to go and we would take your home off the schedule before she hung up the phone .   We did our best and we wanted to thank you for being our customer and allowing us to clean for you for the last six years."}, "gmap_id": "0x886267e4e2355551:0xcce503926b42c2e2"}

I had scheduled a while ago but had to keep rescheduling. They were early, which was good for me since I was out running errands. When I arrived home I found a few things that I didn\u2019t like about the service... I am sure it\u2019s picky but if I pay for a home clean, I want it done properly. But I also do recognize that it being the first clean, it takes a few times to get used to how I want things. First off, and this could have been a huge huge problem if I hadn\u2019t of arrived home shortly after they were finished, my cats were locked in the master bedroom screaming to get out. If they had been locked in there for a while this could have resulted in them scratching up the carpet or them going to the bathroom in the bedroom. Also, all of the blinds were left wide open. I live in a nice community, but anyone walking buy could see right into my place and see I wasn\u2019t home and see the nice things I have. That is a huge problem for me. If I had been out of town, this could have been very bad.\nThen just a few small things... the master bed the comforter wasn\u2019t made up on the bed but folded over at the bottom like it was a throw blanket. In the bathroom I had used qtips that I had forgotten to throw away on the counter top that were in the drawer instead of thrown away. The shower still had some hair in it. In the kitchen the mat in front of the sink was folded up and placed on top of the trash can? The wine bottles were messed up and fallen out of the wine rack. The entertainment center bottom shelves were not dusted but the cabinet doors were shut.\nOther than those few things they did a great job. I\u2019ll definitely be using them again as long as these items can be addressed and rectified.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6a0704b71905:0xb5f94afe5613f0d1"}

Because of time restraints, I decided to hire a cleaning service to come in to deep clean before moving in. I explained to the owner that I needed my home deep cleaned and move in ready. The house was completely emptied and easy to maneuver around in. One employee showed up with a helper friend late afternoon. Long story short, they surface cleaned my house. I had to go behind them to ask questions like: \"Did you clean the top of the cabinets, did you wipe down doors, did you clean the windows,\" etc. because it wasn't being done. As I inspected the kitchen, I noticed dried food stuck on the cabinets, dust on top of the cabinets, which I asked them to go back and clean -same experience in the bathrooms. One of the last tasks was mopping the floor. As one lady mopped, I noticed a small puddle of water on the floor, so I wiped it up. I looked at the white napkin in my hand and it was gray. Yes, she mopped my bathroom and kitchen floors with a filthy mop. I brought it to her attention and the second lady mopped behind the first one with another dirty mop. I seriously thought about asking the ladies to leave early, but I overheard one of them talking on the phone (at work) telling the caller that she was trying to make some money and would be home soon. After hearing that, I decided to allow them to finish the job. I paid the $150 but was extremely dissatisfied.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccc85f3d044ad:0xc5e6408a9aa91a3e"}

After leaving, unfortunately, I was unimpressed, but because we all have \"bad days\", my first instinct was to give them another chance.\nThe day of my follow-up cleaning (2 weeks later), I sent a text to confirm my appt time - since I did not receive a text reminder - like I did for the initial cleaning.  After a short time had past, with no reply, I called and spoke to Chrissy.  Although I did not call to complain, I did mention that I was not satisfied with my first cleaning - and why, but explained that - because everyone has bad days - I was waiting for this cleaning to see how things went.  I must say, once on the phone, Chrissy was very responsive and willing to make everything right.\nNow to the GOOD stuff...  Whitney and Melissa.  These 2 ladies are THE BOMB!  They came in - WORKED HARD, and had my house \"sparkling\" when they left - so much so - that upon their departure, I immediately sent  Chrissy another text message - PRAISING their work and asking to have these 2 young ladies clean my house from now on.  (Sadly - I am still awaiting a response.)\nIt is women like Whitney and Melissa who make a business look - not just good - but impeccable!!!! - and all the bad bearable.  (Two Maids and a Mop - Auburn needs to do all they can do to keep these 2 ladies happy and working for them!)\nI sincerely hope I hear back from Chrissy soon - saying - yes to my request. \ud83d\ude00", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e8bc654731:0x76a1661ea305ee05"}

To clarify, when I entered the information online I was given the price of $140 dollars. I THEN spoke with a representative of the company who clarified the first clean would be a deep clean, but never stated this would result in a higher cost. I was completely misled to believe my fee would be the $140 versus almost $400. When I called to discuss they could not give me a rational for why the price was as expensive as it was and accused me of lying on the internet submission regarding occupancy and square footage even though I told the woman I spoke to on the phone I lived with my boyfriend and two dogs. Completely unprofessional, dishonest and clearly have poor business ethics. Additionally, when I informed them I\u2019ve used cleaning services for a number of years and have never been charged that much for an initial clean (and told them the name of the company I had used in my previous rental), they eluded to the fact that the company in question was not professional or a legitimate business.

As I understand you booked your clean online.  There is some expectation that folks who enter data requested for booking online will provided accurate data.  When booking online you indicated you had 0 pets, 1 occupant, and your square footage was 2200.   My understanding is you have 2 occupants and 2 pets per your phone conversation.    Your clean was actually discounted based on less occupants and no pets.\n\nMy understanding is you had no issues with the service other than price.  Hard to address what you heard or did not hear during the call with our office as it relates to price.  We certainly try to communicate price as part of any booking but your reaction indicates you did not hear it or we failed to communicate it.\n\nLastly, based on your call your position was discount or negative reviews.  Unfortunately we do run into this situation 1 or 2 times per year.   Certainly don't like failing to meet your expectations, but will not be coerced into discounts by threats either.  You bear some responsibility to understand the services you have secured. This would certainly be an exception for one of our customers to invite us into their home to clean and not know what services they will receive and what they will cost.\n\nAny desire to discuss further just call the office and let Chrissy know you want to chat with the owner and she will put us in touch."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e8bc654731:0x76a1661ea305ee05"}

In fact, after your Thanksgiving clean you texted \u201cthe girls did a really good job\u201d.\n\nToday you turned our team away and were charged a cancellation fee.  These type fees are always a tough decision as a business owner.   You know a negative review might be coming because you stuck by your cancellation policy.  In most cases it is the right thing to do for the PHC's whose earnings will be impacted by the late cancellation. For 99% of customers this simply is not a problem as we share this policy in our Welcome Packet.\n\nLike most service companies we do utilize computer scheduling.  We offer multiple cleaning packages.  We even offer custom packages.  Cost will vary based on requirements. What we do is complete the clean as defined in the package you purchase.  Most customers prefer to know what they will receive and want it done consistently.\n\nNow let me offer you some feedback as the owner.  I have owned this location since it opened.  We are not perfect but strive to improve every day.  After speaking with multiple members of our team it is clear to me that your goal was to bully your way out of a fee you were fully informed of.  You were extremely abusive and spoke down to all of our team members on the day after Christmas of all days.\n\nWhile I can empathize with your frustration with being charged a cancellation fee I would challenge to treat people with dignity and respect in the future.  If you cannot do that then I suspect most small business owners like myself would prefer you take your business somewhere else.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

We went back to check everything out almost 4 days after the service came through, and found my thermostat (that I had previously turned off since no one was living there) was running and had been running 24/7 on 65 degrees, and my bedroom fan was still running. So now we will be paying the electric bill for those almost 4 days where my air conditioner had been left to run on a very high setting. Opened the closet with the water heater and there was still dog hair all around the floor, the oven had not been cleaned out, there were flecks of dirt in the bathtub that were not there when I moved out, and nothing around the washer/dryers had been cleaned out. We also went through and re-mopped the floors, and there was dirt coming up on the mopping pads as if the floors had barely been touched. When we sent the photos to the manager, she called my mother back to argue with her that the apartment was very dirty and that they don\u2019t touch water heaters. Apparently sweeping up the floor around the water heater is considered messing with it? This also does not explain the dirty oven, the dirt in the tub that was not there before, and the utilities that had been turned on and left on high for days. All she did was half heartedly offer to come help my mom clean (we had already cleaned up after them so we declined), and no apologies or attempts to reconcile for these other issues were made. She literally only called my mom back to argue with her. $200 later for an hour cleaning of a 450 sq foot apartment, and we had to go spend another hour cleaning up all the stuff they left behind.\n\nIf you don\u2019t leave your apartment spotless, which defeats the entire purpose of having a cleaning service come in (I\u2019m not talking leaving it absolutely filthy and covered in trash, but needing reasonable deep cleaning after 2 years of living there), then don\u2019t even bother hiring this service. If you have any complaints or concerns you\u2019ll be argued with and no attempts to reconcile or partially reimburse will be made.

I will NEVER trust positive Google reviews ever again when researching companies.  I am still so mad I am shaking as I type this.  If I could give negative stars I would.  Now that I have had a night to think clearly about my experience with them yesterday, hopefully writing this review will help someone else not have to deal with the absolute complete hell I had to go through yesterday.  I hired this company to move my family.  I am a single mom of 4 and couldn't move us on my own.  The guys showed up and the loading process was slow.  There was frequent standing around, smoke breaks, one of the guys even asked me to go out and buy them food and I ended up feeding them from my fridge to try to speed the process up.  I did have a lot of stuff to load, but reaching out to multiple companies today to inquire about timing with the type of load I had, the time frame was half what took place at my house, almost like they were milking the clock.  Then when getting to my new home, the men were following me (we left old house at the same time) and they disappeared for over half an hour.  Upon arrival at my new home all hell broke loose!  They spent more time arguing, fighting, taking smoke breaks (cigarettes and marijuana - I thought I smelled it and it was later confirmed by one of the men) and on their phones complaining about their coworkers than actually unloading the moving truck.  It was so bad that myself and my children had to help unload the moving truck because these \"men\" were too busy threatening each other and their families.  They were yelling and screaming at each other in my driveway for over an hour, using profanity and racial slurs, all in front of my children and new neighbors!!  When we left to do the second load more time was spent because one of the men wouldn't get in the Uhaul they had rented and started walking down the road.  Then at the end of the day when everything was finally completed I felt like I was robbed when I paid.  Yes, the owner did give a two hour partial discount on time, but after thinking more over the night and about what happened the discount was no where near what it should have been after what myself and my kids had to go though.  It was hell to a point where the cops were almost called.

My daughter took her shoes off and walked around the floor for a bit and the bottom of her feet were black.  When we walked in I could tell the floors had not been cleaned properly because I could see spots and there were little pieces of junk lying around on the floor.  The floors definitely were not mopped.  The remainder of the house looked like it was just quickly done.  I could have done a much better job in deep cleaning.  Not worth it.\n\nI get that the power eventually went off, but your crew arrived in the morning where there was plenty of daylight coming through the windows.  The main floors in the family and dining room were very dirty, like nothing had been done.  Then the remainder of the floors throughout the house were also extremely dirty.  This honestly should still have been an easy clean considering there was literally NOTHING in our house as we had waited to even move in any boxes or furniture until the the floors were done.  The fact that services took place twice and it still was very dirty made me upset.  I have a 5 year old and a 7 month old demanding baby and simply did not have the time to do floors with the limited time frame we had to move out of our previous home and into our new home.  My husband had to work out of town and we have no family here to help with the kids.  So that left me with other choice but to quickly move our belongings into the our new home on filthy floors.  We held off on bringing our belongings into the home so that we could have our floors cleaned.  Now it is going to be even more difficult because we will have to move our belongings around the house and tackle one room at  time just to get the floors cleaned.

The lady stayed and cleaned again and the second time was a little better, but I had to give a lot of direction. Lastly their vacuum left black marks on my bedroom carpet and she had to ask to use my vacuum cleaner. With all that being said, the customer service department was very understanding and discounted my cleaning and promptly sent out a carpet cleaning company to clean the black spots their vacuum caused. So overall I give them 2 stars instead of 1 because the customer service addressed my problem quickly and the cleaning lady was nice.
