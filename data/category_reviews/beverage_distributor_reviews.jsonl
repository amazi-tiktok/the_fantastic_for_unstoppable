Gave a two week notice as instructed by Judy Graham.. After i worked my two-week notice i took my trip to Africa. It was Amazing! I called from Africa and spoke to Susan from HR about my last check. After two months of the Best days of my life, i went in to work. There was new HR, I saw the new HR lady interviewing the same day i spoke to Judy Graham before my two-week notice. The new HR didn't knw the nature of our conversation and so contacted Judy Graham about wether or not i was suppose to return.i found that strange that nothing about me was in system, but I patiently waited. To my Shock and Suprise, Judy Graham claimed she never heard of me before, she said remind me of who you are because i did not know who you are. I said I'm the employee who informed you of my trip to Africa and i came to you and gave my two week notice. She said she worked out of Montgomery and never worked out of the Birmingham location. (But she was there when HR lady Carolyn Lyttle was out because Carolyn left to transfer to another location.) She said since theres no PROOF of me giving a two week notice i was no longer rehireable. I said call Sydney the warehouse manager. They said they let him go! I said call Johnny another manager. He said he did not know what we discussed and nothing was informed to him (lies) so he took a don't get me involved stance. Finally as I'm leaving i said a quiet prayer to myself, just then the new HR woman said i remember you the day i interviewed. She said I don't know why Ms. Graham is denying knowing you, she said but i didn't hear your conversation I jus know i remember you spoke with her while i interviewed. Judy calls as i'm headed out not knowing i hadn't fully left the room! Then i overhear new HR lady say \"she's still here\". There was a pause. Then she passed the phone to me, Judy Graham basically shouted at me its my fault I didn't put my 2 week notice in writing. I have til this day a letter that we Judy Graham and i corresponded with over something else.(remember she claimed she never heard or knew of me). For her to say she never knew me...well this is the type of stuff we poor black folks on the bottom line have to deal with in a daily basis working in these \"right to work states\".
