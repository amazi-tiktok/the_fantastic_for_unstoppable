I originally stopped at another shop that I'd never been to before (apologize, as I forget the name, but it's on Madison Blvd. - might be Kay's Cleaners-?) ...anyway, I was about to go out-of-state for a funeral in TX.  I only had 1 pair of pants that I could wear, but the legs needed a little bit of hemming.  I was desperate & needed to save money, so I didn't want to buy new ones.\n\nLong story short - the 1st stop said they send out their alterations, so no one at that location could do them.  However, the lady there called over to Angel's Alterations (where they send to) to find out if they could do an on-the-spot hem & was told YES!\n\nSo I immediately drove over to Angel's Alterations (not far at all from other location) and I met Ms. Gloria (aka NAN) who owns the shop.  She is a very-very kind lady, and has such a beautiful little alteration shop with lots of flowers and the cutest little 13-yr-old tiny dog named Coco (sp-?).\n\nSo Ms. Gloria had me try on my pants right then, asked where I needed hemmed & said she would do right away.  She not only did it in less than 10 minutes, but she did it very professionally & for more than a reasonable price for doing it on-the-spot!  I was so very-very thankful!\n\nShe is a very kind Christian lady, and I will definitely be back, as well as recommend her to ANYONE that needs anything hemmed!\n\nNOTE:  If you do go to her, be sure to either have CASH or CHECKBOOK, as she does NOT take credit cards!\n\nBlessings to each!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn2LqtR8cE8yVPKldCwfd4GkLxPw2SKMIP2pKz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5SvEpdXXQHX0pFXcH_2l00KRIwwFyydb6t8AJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f6ab3b43197:0x1a3f81c7c4097c18"}

However I have not been back in about a year until today. I have never experienced such a lack of professionalism in my life. The ladies were extremely unfriendly, Sun proceeded to scream and yell about the difficulty level of hemming a pair of women\u2019s pants, and how she could 50/50 make them work. I said I would just go elsewhere if she didn\u2019t think it was fixable, and she proceeded to further yell in my face asking WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT??? Until I decided to just change clothes and leave. Not being able to hem a pair of pants is fine, but to yell and berate your customers rather than admitting you\u2019re unable to meet their needs is not ok. I have never experienced such disrespect for no reason. Will not be returning to say the least. Only gave 2 stars because of past work being done fairly ok.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f0c76816d65:0x6428ff2eb99a7cf5"}

If you like things done right, go to Shaia's. But the story continues, for the actual wedding day we had a tuxedo picked out that was being made in Italy. The factory had to shut down due to the virus and in the few weeks leading up to the wedding, I was facing quite the dilemma. Ben called me for a special appointment to come in and see what could be done from what was on hand at the store. Ben and Ken went far beyond the extra mile to make sure I was not only clothed for my wedding, but the tuxedo was classy, comfortable, and contained the right amount of original. I cannot recommend Shaia's any higher. There were even a few other minor disasters with needing a haircut and my brides' dress needing last minute alterations that we took to Ken because he just got things done.

I have personally spoken with this customer and explained that there was a misunderstanding that resulted in his impression that the shirts were not here and that he had been misled. My offer to him was and is to do whatever I can to make this up to him, including immediately applying these patches at no cost to the shirts he is purchasing online. Understandably, he is quite upset, but my offer will stand and I sincerely hope that given time, he will allow me to rectify this issue and regain his trust as a customer."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626ca3ef951fd1:0xde96c18e5773d091"}

She planned to \"let out 3 inches\" of the waistline. I called her shop to check the status of my gown the day I was told it would be finished and she implied to me that she hadn't even started altering it yet. She asked for 3 more days (making it 10 days before my wedding day). 3 days later I went to try on my dress and I could not even remotely zip up the entire top half of my dress ( which was not the case when dropped it off to her..I could not comfortably zip it up and maybe had 1\" that I couldn't zip). I believe she took it in 3\" instead of letting it out. After informing me there was no fabric left to let it back out, she then proceeded to embarrass me in front of other people in her shop. She asked if I could find better undergarments to \"suck all of that in\". When I replied that apart from removing a rib or two this is as good as it gets for me, she said \"honey...there is more than just ribs going on here.\" She said \"I can't think of anything to fix this. If I do, I will call you in the next two days.\" I did everything I could to leave as fast as possible so I could get in my car and cry. Thank goodness for Dillard's having formals and I found a decent replacement the next day (9 days before my wedding). Regardless of her skills as a seamstress on other projects, I will not recommend or return to Christine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e16c2ed7d2b:0x5cddc6f062df4b9"}
