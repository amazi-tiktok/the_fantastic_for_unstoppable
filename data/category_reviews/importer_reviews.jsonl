Sheila, the manager was very kind and helpful.   When I got back, I got the carfax report without issue.  There was no high pressure sales pitch that I had become used to after looking at lots of trucks over several weeks. I was honest about minor defects I had found on the vehicle and they acknowledged and did not dispute them.  We haggled a bit as is healthy and expected, but I think all parties were satisfied and I know I got a fair price for the vehicle.\n\nI wanted to use my credit union, so had to wait until Monday to take possession, which wasn't a problem. After a handshake, we agreed to meet again on Monday. On Monday, after I got my credit union info, Sheila checked other banks they commonly use just to make sure I was getting the best deal on my loan.   The truck was cleaned and ready to go, and they had all my paperwork ready to sign.  We exchanged a check for keys and I was out of there in less than 30 minutes.\n\nIt has been a little over a month and I am so far very satisfied with my vehicle, and I would definitely consider doing business with Montevallo imports again.\n\nSince I haven't had a problem, I can't give a full 5 stars since I can't know how they would handle any weird thing that might come up.
