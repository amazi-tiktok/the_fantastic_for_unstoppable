I hired him to repair the circuit board in my welder. Paid him for the job, which only half of it was done. Asked him to replace all of the capacitors on the board. He did not. He left a diode that he had cut loose. The soldering was the worst looking hack jobs I have ever seen. He picked up the board and was paid $90 initially to check it on the machine. I had to drive to Dothan to retrieve it from him and paid the balance of $145. Installed the board and the welder has no output at all now. Originally agreed upon price was $220. When I got the board back the diode was never reconnected, the solder joints were ridiculously poor. And the welder still does not work. He came out and wanted another $25 to \u201ccheck\u201d the board again. He came and \u201cchecked\u201d the board again. He said there is another bad part on the board. How could there be another bad part if he checked the whole board. So after seeing the poor workmanship displayed. I asked for a partial refund. He said no. So now I am out $235 and my welder still doesn\u2019t work. If I had only known that he couldn\u2019t do the job to start with, I would never have hired him to do it. This guy does not know what he is doing! Please save your hard earned money. Seek out a professional.

Ignoring customers is not the answer.\n\nEdit 1/3: he messaged us to repair our tv a few days after the above incident. We let him take it. He stole our tv and closed his business. What a scam.
