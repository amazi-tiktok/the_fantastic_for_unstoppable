Both of us have such fond memories of the center from when we were kids in the 1980s on school field trips. The center is still as fascinating and tranquil as it was then. My favorite exhibit was definitely the aviary. It was the first time I ever saw a bald eagle up close. The lake and the carnivorous plant bog were so idyllic and eye catching; we didn't want to leave. It was like something out of a nature painting. The classroom was also a highlight with live reptiles. We are going to adopt an animal and will definitely be returning here often to donate and be with nature. It is almost like a gasp of fresh air in the midst of a chaotic city.
