She didn't even get any pictures of the bride and father dance, none of the wedding favor's table, or food table.  All those pictures came from family who took their own pictures and sent it to the bride. The bride was very upset because of the money she spent to capture her one and only wedding day and to be told that most of the pictures were destroyed only after she kept hassling the photographer for months. Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

I can not say enough about how professional Platinum Events was through this entire process.  We had a high school dance.  From the beginning to the end, the experience was wonderful.  First was the immediate responses to all questions and communication.  The website was professionally and clearly laid out.  The \"ala carte\" choosing of the services they provide was so user friendly.  All communication was done by email so everything was clear for me.  I didn't rely on any  verbal committments, it was all recorded in emails.  The price...frankly I don't know.  I live by the motto you get what you pay for....I love capitalism.  And if I paid more than other services, I don't care....I got what I paid for....a wonderful experience.  Our services included a DJ, lights, sound system, and mirror photo booth.\nThe DJ set up was compact, high quality and the DJ screened the music for me...(i had enough on my plate).  Their website allowed my daughter to upload a spotify playlist easily and he screened it.  It also allowed a timeline that he respected and utilized..  The website has event planning section ......It was great.  I wish I was gifted at writing so I could paint a picture of what a wonderful experience but.....I had a wonderful experience and will recommend and utilize them a hundred times over!!!  We also utilized the Mirror Photo Booth...so fun.  Great props, assistance at it's side the entire time, easily usable, I am so glad I upgraded to this but I am sure the starter photo selection is great too but I am glad I upgraded to this one.  They designed a stamp for each of the photos customized to our event and they initiated that process and went with it without much of my involvement because I didn't have time.  The individuals who worked the event were dressed appropriately for the event, cordial, available, cooperative....I appreciated them handling EVERYTHING.  It made it worth every penny.\nMy ONLY suggestion would be to work with them on customizing your props for the event.  That was a shortcoming on my part not theirs.  Their props were great but looking back, I wish I had included some things that were directed toward this group of seniors.\nI can't thank them enough for working with us on providing these high school seniors a winter dance that had been cancelled by those around them twice who were more concerned about perceptions of participating in a \"super spreader event\".  They had a wonderful time, fantastic memories, and NO, we weren't a super spreader event.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889106de6b70cbb:0x61316f3dd30eb306"}

He made everything simple and more important for me and my bride he made it affordable; definitely, definitely, would recommend him to anyone I know who has a wedding coming up or even a party and a needs a Dj who is professional and is kind on their wedding budget! For the package we asked for Do Platinum definitely exceeded our expectations; of course besides providing great music he provided lights to help provide the right atmosphere to our reception, and his travel fee was definitely kind on our wallet. When the wedding was over and we went to the reception hall and walk through the doors DJ platinum had a very great set up waiting for us; what stood out most to us was the fact that the lights he used lit up the walls and ceiling with me and my wife's favorite colors of red and purple, both us and the guess we're blown away!

They have a beautiful high quality selection. We worked with Stephanie and she was so sweet patient and professional.  We purchased a new setting for my engagement ring solitaire while we were vacationing there and my solitaire fell out(after 10 years). They helped me select the perfect ring. We put it in layaway as our 10th anniversary was in December(this happened in June). I forgot to snap a picture of it while we were there so I called Stephanie and she happily got it out of the safe and put it on her own finger and sent me pictures via text message. She went above and beyond! We were shopping with our kids and they offered them chocolates and water. We called to have my diamond placed in the new ring on Wednesday of this week and they placed it on the same day we called and overnighted the ring to me for free. I live 6 hours from Gulf Shores. It was at my door the next morning. It is so beautiful! I am so thankful we went there to see about getting my original ring repaired and ended up with a gorgeous new ring that has special meaning since it was purchased at one of my favorite vacation spots. If you need a jeweler you can trust and who has a gorgeous selection give them a try. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d9b67ea82b:0x14d06995d471721d"}

I sometimes like to sit and grab a bite between classes. The food is bit bland, but I have never had any problems with my order. One day I did and was treated horribly for the complaint. I ordered the Camile club with no mayo. When I received my sandwich, it had mayo. So, I calmly went back up and explained that I didn't want mayo. I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God.

I was unsure why, but I assume it is because their gowns are marked up well over retail. After my daughter tried on 1-2 more gowns, an older lady walked over to us and very rudely yelled at my daughter if she was taking pictures she would have to delete all of them before leaving the store. She also said \"I know two of my girls have already told you to stop taking pictures\". This is untrue, as the only person who had previously said anything was the salesgirl (not ours) that said not to take photos of the tags. I could see my daughter was very visibly upset, so we said thank you and left the store. They lost my business forever, as well as everyone I know that I can tell about our experience.

I'm a plus size bride so I was scared; I wouldn't have a lot of selections. I was very wrong; they had dresses in stock for any size bride. Shelby found me three great dresses. There was a dress online that had short sleeves. Shelby let me try on the same dress in strapless & told me she could order it for me with sleeves. Shelby explained payment arrangements & credit options to pay for the dress. Shelby broke everything down in detail for me. Which was very helpful for a new bride with a budget. I was very close to ordering that dress. But, I really wanted to try it on with the sleeves. I was so impressed with David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa; I made an appointment the same day at the David's Bridal in Hoover. I was thinking Hoover would have more dresses with sleeves & possibly have that dress with sleeves to try on. That was the worst idea ever. The store in Hoover is a huge disappointment for David's Bridal. The customer service needs to be reviewed at the Hoover store. The employees at that store are very unprofessional. After the bad experience at the Hoover store; I started reading reviews & asking friends. Apparently that is common for the David's Bridal in Hoover.

They forgot to bring out our champagne for all 150 of our guests for the toast. They didn't have any of the cake ready for the guests, we had to awkwardly stand there with no cake for the guests. After both of those occurrences, one of the rude staff members pulled my husband aside and yelled at him for having a terribly scheduled wedding, even though we gave the staff the schedule for weeks early, which we followed. The bartender was very kind, but there were several times where the bar was left unattended and I was having to wait there with a ton of guests to get a drink.  There even came a point where the drinks were left for guests to grab themselves, and some of our guests were taking whole wine bottles... which didnt seem compliant with ABC rules.

I had a great experience at my first appointment. A very nice, young lady, who was engaged herself, assisted me. She let me try on the dresses I had picked and delivered the style of dresses I was looking for. She was very accommodating to my mother and sister who I had brought with me. We found my dress and I could not have been happier with that first visit. We had a glass of champagne after we decided on it and it was a lovely enjoyable visit.\nThe owner was there and she was helpful and kind as well. When she saw that I was really leaning towards one, she stepped in and let me know what alterations could be made and we ended up changing the neckline a little bit.\nWhen I went to pick up my dress, we had a different experience. In addition to my mother and sister, I brought a couple of friends along to see me in it. I walked in first, and told the lady at the desk that I had an appointment to pick up my dress. She then began to walk back towards the dressing rooms. I didn't follow her at first because 1. she didn't tell me to and 2. my friends and family weren't all inside the shop yet. When I did take a few steps towards where she went, I saw she had turned around and looked annoyed that I had not followed her.\nI put on the dress and she assisted me. After I was in it, I had to ask her if I could go show my friends.\nBy the time I got out and we looked over my dress, my sister and mother had already noticed how unpleasant the girl helping me was. She made us feel like we were a bother to her.\nI enjoyed my first experience tremendously. My second was not so pleasant. The shop is wonderful as long as you do not get the grumpy girl. I wish I had caught her name, but she wasn't friendly enough to tell me and I was too scared of her to ask. I would and do recommend this shop.

Everything has gone pretty smoothly, not a ton of stress, and no bridezilla moments, but of course, every smooth trip needs a little storm. My sister ordered her dress from Bella Couture in Birmingham, they seemed helpful enough with picking it out and promised alterations would be done promptly. Up til yesterday, the alterations hadn't been done. Now you might be thinking \"well, wedding dresses are tricky to fix in a short amount of time..\" , no. It was a simple hem job, and they had six weeks to do it. Six weeks for a simple hem job. And up til yesterday it wasn't done. Fine, alright, you're busy, we get that. But giving her the run around with phonecalls, and promises and then having the audacity to say that my sister is \"hysterical\" and flat out lying about what you've failed to do, and then charging an extra 550$ on a wedding dress that was already paid for, for simple alterations that weren't even done in the allotted amount of time is disgusting. Oh, story's not done yet, they still won't give her the dress.\nSo if you're looking to get married anytime soon, don't go to Bella Couture.

In attempt to getting my girlfriend some Halloween themed flowers, Amy's Florist dropped the ball. I placed an order for one item and 5 minutes later they called and said they did not have the item or vase in stock YET I was still charged. After emailing and calling back, I was fully refunded. I decided to try my luck again and place another order but for a different item. Same thing, received a call saying it was not in stock. The people calling me were horribly unhelpful and rude and made it seem like I was to blame. Why have something on your website if it not in stock? I also find it suspicious Amy's Florist and Pat's Florist have the same exact webpage layouts besides color scheme.

Yes you placed an order off our website that stated NO substitutions.  The closer it has gotten to Halloween we have sold out of most the containers. We would have been glad to do a similar arrangement for you but you said no substitutions. Also you did email us and I got back with you as soon as I seen the email, unfortunately I don't check my emails frequently.  The staff called and left you a message regarding the order, and soon as they spoke with you a refund was issued.  As for the two websites bringing the same...YES they are because a floral company designed them for us.  Nothing suspicious at all about that.  Again, I am very sorry we wasn't able to help you.

Yes, you could have got more flowers from Publix, but I don't sell Publix quality flowers. I only carry the freshest and finest.

We were blown away by how awesome he was! And then our wedding planner (Becky's Brides) recommended him as well, so of course we immediately knew we had to hire him. Needless to say, best. choice. ever!! I have been to weddings with DJs who are not as awesome as Brandon, and you never realize how important the DJ is for the overall vibe and energy of the party until you hear a bad one - haha. Those experiences made me even more thankful that we went with WellDunn because it made all of the difference in the energy of our wedding! Everyone was talking about how awesome Brandon was. He is simply fun and a joy to work with. He is also a genuinely good guy and I can't imagine what our wedding would have been like without him. I was a COVID bride and I was all the more thankful for his empathy and flexibility when we had to postpone our wedding to October. I have to say it was all worth the wait! The highlight of the night was when Brandon let me take over the DJing and the crowd went wild!! Those are some of my favorite pictures from the entire night.

Do not sign a contract with Adam\u2019s Acres, and do not trust them. Adam\u2019s Acres has been operating for less than a year. I was the first bride to book Adam\u2019s Acres. I booked them when all that Brittany Adam\u2019s had to show was studs and pictures of what it would look like when completed. I took a huge risk and trusted Brittany. Now, I regret that decision.\n\nDue to the COVID shutdowns in March, I was forced to postpone my April wedding. All of the dates I had to choose from included holiday dates or August dates. We picked August 15th thinking that COVID would be over by then. However, COVID-19 cases are worse now than they were in April. After a lot of praying and talking to relatives, a month from our wedding, we made the decision to postpone our wedding again! This is not at all what we wanted to do, but for the safty of our family and friends we felt it was necessary. Brittany, being the heartless person she is, refused to give us another Friday-Saturday date in 2021. She offered a Sunday date with our rehearsal dinner being on a Thursday. That would not work for religious purposes and the fact that we have so many out of town guests.  She said \u201cwe would cut into her 2021 revenue if she gave us a Friday-Saturday date\u201d. The only way we would be able to have a Friday-Saturday date is to pay the new 2021 rate of $3500.00 when we have already paid in full of $2500.00. Not only will she not let us postpone to a Friday- Saturday date in 2021, she refuses to give us a refund.\n\nShe has stolen our money and has taken advantage of the COVID-19 situation!!

We were so happy to have Fall dates still available, but we will be very honest...it has been difficult trying to recover from all the bookings we lost because of reschedules, especially when we didn't qualify for any assistance. We are thankful that unlike a lot of businesses we were able to survive and didn't have to close our doors.\nWhen we rescheduled you to August 14th/15th, we held that date for you and turned away other couples and parties that contacted us for that date. Unfortunately when you cancel 3 weeks prior, it is impossible to re-book.\nWe have been open and safely hosting events again since May 30th. Every single couple has been dealing with the uncertainty of COVID and taking precautions to keep everyone safe. We offered to discuss these options with you as well.

Tonight's bride also live-streamed her event so that her grandmother (who could not attend because of her assisted-living's COVID policies) could watch her get married. Vendors are wearing masks, caterers are hiring extra staff to safely serve everyone, our venue has extra staff at events for sanitizing... Everyone is making compromises and working hard to keep everyone safe.\nWe are in no way downplaying the seriousness of this virus. We also have no idea when it will end. We understood the reason for your cancellation and although it goes against our cancellation policy, we were empathetic and offered you a Sunday date in 2021 with no additional payments required. When you told us that interfered with your religion, we again offered for a Monday-Thursday. We are so sorry that none of those options worked for you.\nWeddings are such an emotional time for everyone and we understand your disappointment. We know that all couples and wedding vendors alike have been thrown into incredibly difficult situations. When what you want to do for your couples conflicts with how you have to run your business--it feels impossible. If we let one person reschedule, we would have to do it for everyone to be fair. We are so sorry, but we simply cannot do that and keep our doors open. We have to follow our cancellation policy in this situation."}, "gmap_id": "0x889297ef32ece5ff:0xf3bd8bb0f4a416a"}

They were so responsive and accommodating, always providing feedback for any question, big or small, and always went out of their way to make sure everything for my wedding was taken care of. Lecia, my day of coordinator, made sure that all of the d\u00e9cor for the reception was taken care of two days in advance and set everything out-it looked absolutely gorgeous. Everything she did relieved me and my mom of so much day-of stress. Hannah, my bride's assistant, was at my side during all of the pictures before the ceremony, holding my flowers when I needed help with my dress, adjusting my train, pinning my hair back and making sure my veil was in place at all times. She was truly a lifesaver and made it so easy for me to enjoy taking pictures and had everything you could possibly need from bobbie pins, to a mirror, to a glass of water. Tina is extremely honest and straight forward, which I LOVE. I always felt that she had my best interest in mind and would give me the best advice so I could make decisions regarding all aspects of the wedding. I am not from Chattanooga, so I had questions about almost every vendor and she never steered me wrong. She was so much fun to get to know and from the beginning, I felt at ease with her, knowing she was going to be on top of everything for the reception. Since I had a church ceremony, she did not coordinate for that, but she made sure to know all of the details and really took my vision and made it a reality for the entire event. If you are looking for a coordinator, and don't want to spend a fortune, In Style Weddings is the way to go. They do not sacrifice professionalism or quality of service, they are extremely helpful, can fit into almost any bride's budget, and are absolutely worth every penny for the peace of mind they provide!

We wanted to avoid the \"wedding nightmares\" you hear about with vendors falling through or ripping you off or all of the above and we chose wisely. We visited the venue and after meeting Yolanda, we immediately said \u201cthis is the one\u201d. We looked no further and this is the only venue we visited. It is as beautiful in person as you see in the many photos on their website and in other bride's pictures. I cannot wait to get our pictures/videos back. It is a family owned business and quite reasonable in the grand scheme of average wedding costs. We had unlimited contact and visits with all staff. We moved to the south a year before getting engaged and decided to have everyone come down to us for a good ol\u2019 southern wedding. The logistics were overwhelming and Yolanda, Candace and Terri were wonderful in making sure everyone was picked up, transported and generally accommodated. They take care of all the major details so for a detail-oriented person like me, it was great because I had time to craft my own little personal touches. We rented out the mansion for the immediate families and wedding party to spend the night with their guests and when we pulled up, we got nothing less than Ooos and Ahhs about how beautiful and serene it all is. Every vendor Yolanda has in her arsenal is remarkable and a joy to work with - she wouldn't have it any other way and that is how you know you're looking at the right venue/planner. The day-of coordinator (Terri) is a MUST-DO for Brides. We actually ate at our wedding! We had our first meal as husband and wife and no one even knew and just assumed the wedding norm ( that you don\u2019t get to eat the delicious food you hand-selected!) It was absolutely incredible. Everyone was so surprised that she answered all of their questions, let them do whatever they wanted within reason and even partied and had a blast with us. You will not find a more flexible venue/planner anywhere. There were bridesmaid's guests that were not a part of the wedding party and while we were off taking pictures or getting ready, she let them hang out, swim in the pool and generally do whatever as if they were at their own homes. In terms of the wedding, she was willing to go above and beyond to make the day special for us. She found us the perfect officiant who let us do a cultural element as part of our ceremony \u2013 something they were equally as excited to see executed. We wanted to light off lanterns at the end of the night and she said absolutely. Nothing was out of the realm of possibilities or \"against the rules\" and that is how your wedding day should be - exactly as you want. Everywhere else we looked there was a \u201cNo-no\u201d list of things you cannot do \u2013 be out by 11, no open flames, no loud music, etc etc. That list does not exist at Oak Island and they will try to accommodate all of your requests within reason.\n\nIf you are looking for a one of a kind wedding experience with seasoned professionals, listen to their advice (they've done way more weddings than you!) and go with Oak Island Weddings. We could not have been happier with our choice.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888948c6f31e0777:0x7dbfd474cbd2c867"}
