Ones in local grocery store are too thick... Like eating a burrito wrapped in a piece of bread. Found some thinner ones that will work great... They have small cafe... Got some steak tacos... EXCELLENT... Been looking for a place that serves the kind of Mexican food I grew up eating in Los Angeles.... Only suggestion would be to serve the taco with 2 tortillas each... Next time I will get a couple extra ones. Will make eating them easier... Won't fall apart. Two thumbs up.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3c8b3acaaf47:0x8adf24d05f706c5f"}
