After months of gathering quotes, I chose Brandon and Shelly Cantron at Blue Falls as my contractor. They were neither the cheapest or the most expensive, but fell in line with my budget. Their work is thorough and Brandon's wood working skills are impeccable. Many of the custom details I requested involved tedious and exhausting labor. Blue Falls have proved themselves to be capable of the tasks and accomplished in their desire to put the customer first. Throughout this process, my confidence that there are still good people in the world has been restored. After working with them, I consider them to be more than a business acquaintance and have elevated them to the status of friends.

The floor joist was successfully repaired. Unfortunately when I got back and poured some water over the patch I found that it still allowed water onto the support.\nI contacted the business owner (Devin Lanier) on February 25 by text message and by email on February 27th.\nThe business owner replied via email the next day stating \"So sorry about that. Let me look at our schedule and I will get someone back out there to check it out ASAP\".\nThe company scheduled an appointment for Sunday March 3rd to look at the leak. A storm came through the area on the day they were scheduled and I understand it would not have been possible for them to come out. Unfortunately no cancellation notice was communicated to me.\nI reached back out by email on March 4th to ask again for someone to check on the leak and I was told \"Yes a few of my guys were caught up up with the weather. Let me look at our schedule this week and try to get someone to cut loose and head over there. I\u2019ll let you know. \"\n\nSince the email on the March 4th I have not received any contact from the company.

I ordered one piece of granite for a 84\" bathroom vanity. I ordered a remanent off of a slab there. I paid a 50% deposit and they were holding it for me. When it was time to be installed, they brought it for my vanity. Unfortunately they installed a piece that was not mine. I paid the balance of this in November and I wasn't ready for it until April. When I went by the shop to pick up a small piece for the shower, I was advised I still owed the other 50% as they didn't show it paid for.. Thank goodness I had a canceled check to prove I had paid for it. I contacted them and advised they had installed the wrong one.  They said they would call the owner, they have never gotten back to me with any kind of explanation at all.  It is installed with no explanation and no apology. Now it would cost me an extra fortune because I am not living in the house and the plumbers installed all the plumbing which would be another added expense to have it replumbed. An apology would have been nice, or they didn't have enough remanent left, or some kind of an explanation and give me another choice. I had no choice in the matter.  No I would not recommend them for any stone work.  After over 1100.00 for 84 inches, we sent them pictures of what we bought and what we had.  The only contact I have had since was they sent me the warranty with still no explanation whatsoever.   I have never been so disappointed in a company and I will never do business with them again. So my situation is this: live with it for the rest of my life or have a law suit and have the bathroom torn up again which has not even been offered..

The quality of work in areas of my complete remodel is pathetic. We had Clay do a complete remodel of a 1983 condo. He not only left us with work that needed to be redone but he did not pull permits with the city and cut corners to save on his cost. The paint and trim work is the most frustrating and disappointing of all. Areas of trim were left short in doorways and a single coat of watered down paint was \u201csplashed \u201c on the walls. I paid to have the walls textured and the visual inconsistency is disgusting. There are multiple areas where the paint is not complete and behind the toilet was left unpainted too. The 1980s faceplates were left on the outlets and painted around. The outside doors were changed out but not painted either. I guess the factory primer was good enough? Same for the crown molding...factory primer again. A water leak occurred from the painter not paying attention created damage to the unit below us as well.  We had him replace the old AC unit and duct work moved from the floors to the ceiling. The power cord supplying the AC wasn\u2019t replaced to meet code and I had to pay someone to fix the issue after the job was complete. Electrical outlets were left dead and the microwave was mounted flush under the cabinets preventing ventilation. The knobs to the faucet sink weren\u2019t even screwed on. I\u2019m out more money to fix what should have been taken care of by my contractor. I understand that projects don\u2019t always come out the way you want but the texture, trim and paint job done on this job is unacceptable by anyone\u2019s standards.

Two days later i got home and I could not believe my eyes. There were two large storage pods in the driveway, all the furniture was removed and stored. All the cabinets and cupboards were removed, the place was completely stripped. There were big fans all over, and the rooms were blocked off from the rest of the house.

I wish he would have been the project manager on my rebuild. However on the rebuild side.. not so much.. said project manager who I will not mention he knows who he is did not communicate well with the contractors on my rebuild. I had to fix AC vents myself that said project manager had told contractors to fix as I told them not to take down. they taped around them and when they took tape off. they ripped em out... they had no knowledge of it to fix them and were not told.. They damaged my drawer in my kitchen and tried to blame me for it. Broke my kitchen faucet as they should have taken the faucet from the sink.. Instead I find my sink on the floor all willy nilly . On the paint process they puled nails and picture hooks and patched but on other areas they just painted over the pic hooks and so forth. They also painted without using drop cloths on my wood floors and set a paint tray on my wood floor without a drop cloth under it. and I will have to pay someone to pressure wash my front sidewalk as they got paint spatters everywhere when they were cutting and working outside.. They did fix the items in question, drawer faucet and cabinets. but project manager said we will go thru this during the walk thru.. To me it would make sense to take care of this BEFORE THE walk thru.. I am visually impaired and I am glad I had friends to point out stuff they needed to fix.. They got it all fixed but it should have never come to that had the project manager been on the ball. Y'all need to put me on the payroll for this job. and he charged me for a Dump truck that did not get used for hauling away debris.. This was a rebuild no debris to haul away. He got snappy and angry.. \"I am not taking that truck charge off\"  and took it personally when I questioned the Dump truck charge. I am not trying to nickel and dime anyone I just expect things to be as they were before it happened. Said project manager was very aloof and uncaring or understanding. I might be legally blind but I am not stupid. If I was totally blind with no help my place would have been totally jacked up after the sign off. and lastly they put my upper kitchen cabinets in crooked.They had to pull and put in correctly... who does not use a level when putting in cabinets. Very hasty sloppy work that should have been done right the first time.  I understand that folks try to get over on folks like y'all but I just wanted stuff done right..

Paul Davis Restoration was recommended to remove the moldy materials and repair the walls. Two groups of folks with different skills and equipment were needed to effect the repair.\n\nPhase 1: Dan Wong came to the house and took pictures and measurements and provided a detailed estimate for removing the mold. Work was scheduled soon after and workers removed the affected materials within a couple of hours and left a very large dehumidifier, four or five air handlers and a couple of HEPA filter units. After three days of continuous noise and tripped circuit breakers the walls were dried out, my allergies started clearing up and I was a happy camper.\n\nPhase 2: Dustin Hunt came to the house to survey the \"damage\" take measurements and pictures, then provided a detailed estimate for reconstruction of the dining room walls. Work was scheduled soon after and workers arrived at the scheduled time and completed the work over 2.5 days since drywall and paint take longer.

I knew after talking to him about his process and reviewing his photos on his website that I had found the right person to do the job.  He kept me in the loop through the whole thing.  He comes over when he says he will and calls beforehand, he finishes the job when he says he will.  He took my cabinet doors and drawer faces back to his shop and sprayed them there.

{"user_id": "115504932104850664042", "name": "David Solomon", "time": 1482943464951, "rating": 1.0, "text": "For this review, I feel I must first present a little information up front.\nFor the last several months I have been having issues with the plumbing in my house.  My house was built in 2007 with PVC pipe throughout.  Let\u2019s just first say that after purchasing the home I later believed the plumbing was not installed to code, and first experienced several water leaks of which I fixed myself.\n\nSeveral months ago I hired a plumber to come in and resolve a hot water (lack of) issue.  The Hot water tank had made an awful screeching noise similar to what I have been hearing in my modern GE Refrigerator with a water filter. At the time the plumber removed a check valve on the water Heater which resolved my Hot water problem and the screeching noise.  No further investigation was conducted on why the Hot water heater started having issues and I believe that repair cost me around $100.00.\nSo in the last couple of months I have still have that screeching with my Refrigerator and the pipes had been banging whenever we flushed one of the toilets.  Upon doing some research to try and resolve the banging pipe issues I had come across an article on a thermal expansion tank upstream from the Hot Water Heater on the Cold water line.  I located mine under the house just as the main cold water line comes in the house. The tank has a valve in it and is supposed to give a cushion for the water when it expands.  I went to check the expansion tank and when I put on an air tester, water came out, which is an indication of a faulty tank.  I purchased a new one and left the air pressure at the manufacture default and installed it.  Now my pipes started banging worse and the tank started making a sucking sound. I further researched the issue and found an article that too much water pressure can wreak havoc on your water system so I went to Lowe\u2019s and picked up a cheap home water pressure gauge. I tested my system and found that my home was averaging around 130PSI. Based on this information resources indicated that a faulty Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) just up from the home water meter could be the culprit. I located mine by digging about a foot up from the local water meter and left it uncovered.\nIt was finally time for me to call a plumber as I am not one, and only completed the previous steps out of necessity.  I am a retired Enlisted Veteran and have not had a real job for six years and have been struggling to pay my bills.\n\nThe day before Christmas I called B & C Plumbing Inc. and left message on their phone system that I would be needing their services when they could work me in.  Tuesday after Christmas I received a courteous phone call from the B& C customer service and scheduled a Master Plumber to arrive at my home between 14:00 \u2013 16:00. Shortly after that Drew the Master Plumber called me from his cell phone and said he was on his way over because he had a cancellation and would come and resolve the issue.\n\nThis is where the negative experience starts.  Drew arrived at my front door knowing the information that I had already shared previously and I shared that information with him again on what my issue was going on under the house.  His first statement to me before looking at anything was that it was going to cost me $300.00. No indication of a discount for anything or because I was a Military Vet.  Now first off, I expected that he would be crawling under my home and fix some of the issues with the bagging pipes (Non-Code meeting).  He had no time to give me a run down on what the problem was nor what it the cost layout was to fix my issues.\n\nHe proceeded to place a water pressure gauge on the outside faucet and recorded that the PSI was 145. He then went to the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) and replaced it spending less than two hours of actual time far less work as much of the time was him on the Cell phone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487948819020, "text": "Mr. Solomon, in response to your review I would like to apologize for your unsatisfactory experience with our company.

However after a few minutes looking in the attic and walking the roof, it was determined that during construction of my home some 25 years ago, a handful of framing nails used to secure the plywood roof deck had missed the rafter below, and after all these years had begun to back out of the plywood deck, pushing up the roof shingle just enough to let water pass underneath. The roofer walked the entire roof looking for nails that were backing out (not just in the area of the water stains below, but the whole roof), removing all that he found, sealing the hole and making sure the roof shingle lay flat. Two days after the repairs we had a lot of rain, and no water leaks inside the house.\n\nOnce again, Pickett Construction has made my wife and I very happy, and I will not hesitate to call them in the future.

Josh did a great job with my wife letting her see and select the tile, flooring and paint, etc.\n\nDo you want to know if Pickett is versatile or can get the job done fast? Pickett did the following items in 17 days ... 350 feet of new privacy fence and gates, paint entire house exterior, re-roof covered deck, remove turbines and patch roof areas, repair rotted roof decking around chimney stack, re-flashed and re-roofed the area, installed new LED motion detecting security lights, installed new outdoor lighting over front door,replaced all windows with new double hung, double pane vinyl windows, installed new laminate/engineered word floors on the entire main level of the house, laid tile in both foyers, kitchen and den/study, replaced every interior door and all hardware, installed new ceiling fans in each bedroom and main foyer, removed wrought iron raining in foyer and replaced with wood and balusters, primed and painted all interior trim, scraped popcorn/acoustic ceiling from kitchen, repaired drywall issues in bedrooms and kitchen, textured and painted kitchen walls.\n\nAny \"extra\" I asked about was repsonded with a written proposal so that there could be no confusion or disaggrement.\n\nTo get these things done in the time frame of 17 days ... including holidays ... shows excellent planning and execution. I was kept informed as to what was scheduled for the day, who would be there and what to expect. They arranged for the construction dumpster delivery and pick up. Pickett did a nice job on the site clean up as well.\n\nPunch list items were few and far between and resolved promptly.\n\nThe only thing that would be close to a concern or a negative was the sub-contracting tile guy who was going through a diviorce while he did the job. He did not do a bad job but his distraction resulted in a couple of small punch list things that Josh had Tripp take care of. I was assured that they would not be using this tile guy in the future.\n\nWould I recommend Pickett Construction to you? Absolutely. Want to see pics of the renovation? I have them.

{"user_id": "108852040032783306603", "name": "Tim Calhoun", "time": 1396761930047, "rating": 4.0, "text": "Pricing:\nWe contracted with Pickett to complete some work on our house to prepare it for sale. We were looking for some typical wood rot to be replaced and exterior paint. We also requested an interior paint quote. I think the quote was a bit high for the exterior work, but not so bad that I didn't go with their services. The quote for the interior painting was outrageous, so we opted for another painter. The other painter's quote was nearly $3000 less than the quote from Pickett. We were also having some plywood put in the ceiling of the carport, because the builder used interior drywall in our neighborhood. Pickett gave us a \"complimentary upgrade\" to beadboard instead of plain plywood. This really added a nice touch to the carport ceiling, and was an appreciated upgrade. They only requested 1/2-down to start the work, which we felt was certainly reasonable. They also honored their coupon they regularly have (often in the Alabaster Newsletter, or ValPack). We printed ours from the ValPack website.\n\nWorkmanship:\nThe quality of the exterior work was pretty good. There were a few spots where the painting got a bit \"sloppy,\" but was overall good work. The beadboard in the carport made a great upgrade to our carport, and added a touch of \"class\" to an otherwise mundane area of the house. Unfortunately, due to our unusually cold winter, the holidays, and several bouts with rain, our work was regularly delayed. It took a bit longer than expected to complete, but didn't delay our schedule of listing the house. The little interaction I had with the crew was polite and courteous, though at times the project manager came across as mildly arrogant. Communicating with the PM via email was the best medium, although he sometimes took a bit longer than expected to return messages.\n\nPost Work Follow-up:\nAgain, the delays in returning messages made for a challenge in clearing our post-work \"punch list,\" but this was also around the holidays, so we conceded a bit.  Had there been more clear communication about workday expectations (e.g. workers will/will not be onsite today) this would have made for better overall feeling about the length of the job.\nDuring our home buyer's inspection, they found more wood rot that was inadvertently overlooked by the crew. While I don't expect the painters to look over every square inch of the house (heck, neither did I!), it ended up being a significant portion of the chimney that had rotted out the edge of our masonite siding. One would expect that at least part of that might have been discovered and either repaired or at least alerted me to the potential change in an estimate so it could be repaired. When we approached our PM about correcting it, he gave us a price quote. After paying over $6000 for the original work, this was certainly unexpected, especially with their \"1 year warranty.\" I spoke with Josh, the owner's son who is also in management with the company. He immediately started working with me to find a reasonable solution. I ended up having to pay a bit more, but we did come to an acceptable compromise on the final cost of the supplemental work. In the end, Josh personally stopped by the house to deliver the revised agreement and took pictures of the missed work. It turned out that the rot was more severe than even he expected. He opted to continue to honor that revised estimate and didn't charge anymore. Josh really worked hard to make a relatively displeasing situation wok out well in the end. Josh was absolutely committed to service and ensuring my end satisfaction. He even reached out after the supplemental work was completed to check in on my satisfaction, and knowing there was a bit of a sour taste, still wanted this Google Review. Josh knows what it takes to listen to customer concerns and immediately find a reasonable solution that works in the best interest of all parties. Had it not been for Josh's actions, my 4-star rating would have been a high 2-star, or low 3-star.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}

The project involved demo of some existing kitchen cabinets, replacement of a cook top and stove with a range, replacement of a vent hood, installing new kitchen lighting, laying tile, painting cabinets and bookshelves, painting trim, and painting walls.  All of this was handled by David's crew without having to sub out any work. The quality of the work done was really top-tier.  We used David's decorating consultant, Lindy, to help pick out colors, and the result has significantly brightened and beautified the two rooms where we spend most of our waking hours.\n\nWhen you undertake a project that takes this much time, you quickly realize that you have invited some strangers into your home for a lengthy stay.   Well, the guys David sent did not stay strangers for very long.  They were cheerful, friendly, and helpful to us.  They added, without cost, some features to the project at our request, even though these features were not in the original contract-- for example, installing a dimmer switch in the kitchen, replacing flood lights in our dinette area so they would match the color put out by our new kitchen lighting, cutting out the trim along one wall of our living room so our bookcase could lay flat against the wall, and installing wall outlets in our bookcase.  They cleaned up after themselves every day and hauled away their own trash.  When they moved furniture around to do some painting, they always put it back where it had been.  It got to where we enjoyed having the company at our house.  At the end of the job, we were glad it was completed, but we were sorry to see the guys leave.\n\nAll the work was done with great attention to detail.  They found and installed tile to match our existing kitchen backsplash tile.  They worked on our project every weekday for three weeks.  On some days, they worked on our cabinet doors and bookcase at their shop, but on the days when they did not come, David always called us to let us know they would not be there and what they would be doing that day.\n\nWe will certainly call on Lisenby Construction if we undertake new remodeling projects.

The appt. came and went and no one showed.  Come to find out, rep went to our old address ( I gave new address during the phone call)  I called them to reschedule.  Rep showed up at our home and that was the end of the beginning.  He did not listen to us.  We did no want re-facing but he continued to measure existing cabinets which we did no intend to keep.  I asked to look at the books he brought in.  He asked rather snarkily, have you checked out our website???  Yes, but since you have books can I look?  At the  end of a very awkward meeting, he said they have a designer that could help with what we want.  We have not heard anything from this company 4 months later.  The end.

I've have tried calling their sales office, I was told to call corporate, I called corporate and got voicemail.\n\nMy house is about 4 years old.  Well out of warranty.  But, most of the poor workmanship appears after the warranty period has ended.  My master bath and entrance to our master bedroom has severe structural problems.  The cracks you see have been re-plastered and painted more than once.  Forget about doors closing properly.  The doors have been trimmed to such an extent that a new door will be required for the bedroom.  The framing issues you may have will not be covered by your warranty and will not appear until a few years after you own your home.  Once they do, you will find yourself spending a lot of money to repair.\n\nIf framing were the only issue, I probably would not write the review.  I never do this kind of thing.  But the electrical was done so poorly that it nearly burned the house down.  The left exposes copper to aluminum high voltage line exposed in a junction box.  The result was blowing out the double oven's control panel.  This resulted in an expensive repair to the ovens, but could have easily resulted in a fire.   Again-- the kind of thing that happens well after your warranty period has expired.\n\nThe problem I have with Woodland, is that their \"quality\" is only skin deep.  They have a great marketing staff, but once your in your house and a year has passed you are on your own to deal with the poor workmanship that lies just below the surface.  No builder is perfect.  But, it would be nice if they built to code.

It\u2019s good quality, the design process was fun, and we felt like the options they had to choose from were exactly in line with what we wanted, but the worst mistake I ever made was trusting that they would continue their great service after having closed on the house. If you don\u2019t listen to anything else, just hear me when I say do NOT let them close on your house until they finish everything. It has truly been bad enough that I regret ever choosing them as a builder, no matter how much we do like the house itself.\n\nAnd again, if I\u2019m being completely honest, the staff that they have are nice people. I mean I have legitimately enjoyed dealing with most of their staff, but I\u2019ve also had to do their job for them. I have to do all of the follow-up to make sure people are showing up to do their warranty repairs. I\u2019ve had to coordinate with the warranty department and the subs to make sure they had all of the correction items listed.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting dealing with Woodland and their lack of support for Warranty customers. I\u2019ve told them this multiple times, but if they would put just as much care into how they treat and deal with Warranty customers as they do with new customers still in the building process, they would be a nearly flawless business. Until then, they deserve this negative review and more. I\u2019ve spoken with multiple people in my neighborhood who can corroborate this story and would say the same thing themselves. We have warned people we know away from Woodland specifically because of this and away from some of the specific sub contractors they use. Horrible customer service, dismal professionalism, and a demeanor that says \u201cyou as a customer don\u2019t matter to us as much as the new build customers.\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617991364735, "text": "Blake,\n\nThank you for the kind words regarding your home building experience with Woodland Homes. We are happy to hear that you had a fun experience and enjoyed our process of building. Next, we would like to say that we understand your frustrations with warranty. We are in fact struggling with time lines and subcontractors. At this time North Alabama and surrounding areas are experiencing a housing boom. This combined with the struggles of building a product in the midst\u2019s of a global pandemic have made it difficult to obtain products for some of our customers warranty requests.\n\nIt is also difficult to keep subs motivated when they have so much work to choose from in front of them. This is just the honest truth, and the reality of the world we are living in.  That said we understand it is frustrating to wait on your items to be completed. While it may take us a little longer to complete a warranty item we are getting to all of our customers and completing their warranty requests. In fact, we have even extended specific warrantable items past the agreed upon 1 year term in order to ensure our customers are happy, and have their items completed .\n\nSince we don\u2019t know your full name there is no way to reach out directly.

Upon walking through my home I found basic issues with the craftsmanship that should\u2019ve been addressed by the site manager, if he had completed a walk thru of the home. Once the home was complete a final walk thru was scheduled. I found the same issues as the last walk thru. At this point, if you don\u2019t address the problem it\u2019s often overlooked. I refused to sign for the keys. As a buyer I felt rushed to sign for the keys to the home, that wasn\u2019t ready.

The subcontractors provided poor quality of work. No disrespect, but the attention to detail lacked, for my home. I hope no one has to go through what I did. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s due to the number of homes Woodland is trying to build or is this the standard issue with Woodland across the board. I didn\u2019t want to come off as a complainer, so I asked around my neighborhood and many of us shared the same problems. This is not to bash Woodland. The homes, cosmetically looks great, I think more effort needs to be made to build a better quality home for the price and oversight of the subcontractors is a must. If this doesn\u2019t happen hold the site manager accountable. The warranty department shouldn\u2019t make people feel like they are the problem. The subcontractors need to do their job and provide a quality product.

It actually defies logic that I could desire so much to live there, be impressed with what I saw, and have the experiences I have had. Maybe it is coincidence but I don\u2019t think so. I will simply state what happened and let the reader decide. I have seriously looked at Woodland homes 4 times. The first experience was positive but I was afraid of the road in and out of the area so I decided not to buy. The last 3 times I had resolved that fear and wanted to purchase a house from Woodland homes. The first of these three, I spoke with an associate. He showed me a lot and gave me a price for a home on the lot. He said we had to see his boss. I did so and she literally panicked. She said he gave me the wrong price. I said ok and left. The second of these 3 times, Woodland homes sent me an email with an advertisement for a house already built. It was priced in the range we were looking for. We made an appointment with the aforementioned realtor and spent 30 minutes looking at the home. It had one feature we did not like but we were about to make an offer when she said oh no, this house has been sold. She added, but we can build you one like it on another lot. We spent a couple of hours looking at lots and found 3 we liked. She said she would send us the prices on all three. The result was that the lot we wanted was not available for the house we wanted to build on it and the other two had prices that were 40 to 50 thousand dollars more than the one we looked at. Not exactly the same price...The last time my wife met with a different realtor and got prices for several models one of which was built and the other almost completed. You have probably guessed what happened. I showed up with the checkbook only to find that all of the homes with quoted prices were much higher than documented on the plans provided to my wife. The one we really wanted was about $70,000 more. The other home already built was about 40,000 dollars more than documented on the plans.We left and will not return. The neighborhood looks great and maybe our experience is some kind of odd anomaly. Just wanted to share it.

However, if you are looking for top quality and attention to detail, you would be better off with another builder. They build homes quickly - maybe too quickly as evidenced by some of the problems we have experienced.  After living in our home for two years, a light switch in our dining room which was not in use at the time suddenly sparked and popped and caused a breaker to blow.  I called an electrician who discovered that the wiring was barely connected which caused arcing and sparking.  He then checked a few more light switches and outlets to find that about half of them were loose and sloppily constructed.  I ended up paying for the electrician to inspect every light switch and electrical plug in my home. I have also had to replace wiring in the electrical box because of a humming noise.\nWhen you build a home with Woodland, they schedule you for a one day marathon of dealing with the contract staff and their design team.  You must be prepared to make ALL decisions in one day.  Their design center has a limited number of choices and you have no time to research products. Don't assume that they offer quality products, either.  Price Pfister products were their plumbing choice at the time I built my home. Huge mistake.  If I had known how crappy this brand was, I would have insisted on Delta products. That goes for wood floors also.  I chose a \"premium\" product for an additional cost only to find after it started denting and scratching immediately that it was made out of a soft eucalyptus based engineered wood.  I have already replaced half of it with a nice Hickory engineered wood that has held up beautifully- even in high traffic.\nI was not happy with either their ceramic tile selection or carpet choices but had no option other than to pick what I disliked the least.  Apparently, most of my neighbors did the same because we all have the same back splash.  I have already replaced carpeting in my bedroom because of poor wear.\nThis is not the first home that I have had built so it is not like I was expecting perfection.
