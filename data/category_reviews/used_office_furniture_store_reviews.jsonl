Apparently, the online ordering process is only convenient if the item you're ordering is not actually in the store and you need it to be.  Otherwise, you will spend just as much time, if not longer, standing at the online pickup counter trying to pick up the item you searched and already paid for online.  Office Depot scanned my driver license (I had already clarified that I personally would pick up the order, as the online form asks). I was asked twice if I wanted a receipt, once by the computer then by the rep (the receipt already came to my email,  along with the $ withdrawn from my account when I placed the order).  I had to sign the credit card panel.  Honestly, I don't have to do all that when I order $200 worth of groceries online for pickup at Walmart.

Came in to pick up extra  mechanical pencils and note cards while in the area and went to the check out.

The older female notices me as well and has to tell the younger female with her back 4 times to return to her register.  She goes to register, doesn't greet me or ask if I found everything alright.  Instead only asks if I want to sign up for a membership a few times after I decline repeatedly.  She puts my order in the bag and walks off before I can take my card out of the chip reader and back into my wallet.  Didn't even get a thank you for shopping.  Will not return again since staff doesn't want to make their customers feel welcomed or care if they make the sell. Will just order supplies from Amazon in advance, or go to Walmart in a pinch.
