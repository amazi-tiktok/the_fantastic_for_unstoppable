Then they sold the rental I was using when they would have mine, so I tried Lilly.  Got a rental and they took my lift in for an annual service, header hoses and some oil leaks, primarily rear main seal.  Well, they had it for 6 weeks, broke the exhaust pipe, charged me 6000.00, that's right SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS, and fixed nothing.  All the same leaks were there, called, sent a mechanic out, did something, said all good, and left.  Nothing fixed.  The main seal leak has gotten worse and worse.  Finally Briggs got another suitable rental and have my lift right now repairing everything Lilly did not.  Not sure what Lilly did for 6 weeks other than an oil change, a couple of header hoses and breaking my exhaust.  This is the worst company I have EVER dealt with.  The icing on the cake?  I paid in full, and they keep sending me bills 6 months later.  Then I call, they say they will look into it, never hear back and next month get another bill.

I was just informed that the part wasn't even ordered; and they didn't even have the decency to let me know. To top it off, the customer service rep for the parts department was completely unprofessional and spoke to me as if it were my fault the part was not ordered, and that \"ill just have to deal with it not being shipped today\".\n\nI deal with multiple distributors, and have never had any issues like I experienced with this company. It is safe to say that after this trial run with The Lily Company, I will not be setting up an account and using them regularly.
