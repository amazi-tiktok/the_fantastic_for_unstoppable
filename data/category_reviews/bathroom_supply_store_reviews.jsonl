My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift.

They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened.

I'm good. WRONG!!! The outlet had to be above the microwave.... Something that would have been nice to know, but they could not communicate that properly.\nThen, the delivery/installation people had no idea what they were doing. They were more of a delivery company, not an installation professional. They could not install my gas range. They damaged my microwave. So, really, they weren't even a good delivery company. Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!!

It took me 4 different phone calls to reach an actual person. The delivery people could not be reached. I waited at the property until 10pm. I went to the store the next day and spoke with the manager, and apparently I was the 3rd customer complaining of no delivery and no notification. The store could not reach the delivery service because they were closed, and would not re-open again until that Tuesday after Christmas. I was told they \"might\" start calling customers then to attempt to re-schedule deliveries. I found this to be completely unprofessional and unacceptable.
