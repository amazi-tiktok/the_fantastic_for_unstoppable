I, along with my parents and even my grandparents, have used them for a number of occasions over the years. We often used them in Student Council at DHS as well. However, I won\u2019t be using them again going fruther.\n\nI currently live in a different city, but I recently called Simpson\u2019s to inquire about having flowers sent to my mother for Mother\u2019s Day and had an encounter with a employee by the name of Anne that left me dissatisfied. While she might have appeared quite polite by her tone, she came across fairly condescending when I asked if they might be delivereing on the day of the holiday this year. I consider it extremely poor customer service to make any customer feel as if their questions are unwarranted, especially if they\u2019re legitimate. Many florists do deliver on Mother\u2019s Day even if they are normally closed on Sunday because it\u2019s a popular holiday for flowers. She even infomred me they themselves did previously deliver the day of Mother\u2019s Day, but no longer do. So it couldn\u2019t have been that absurd of a question.\n\nPreviously, I had no particular preference for either Simpson\u2019s or their other main competitor in town, but going forward I will be doing all of my business with their competitor. It\u2019s not only important to sound polite when interacting with customers, but also it\u2019s just as important to connect and be personable when engaging with customers.

The lady there quickly got on the defensive and stated, we can't take that back in a nasty and rude way.  Then she proceeded to go through a list with me from planting to watering to see if she could find a reason to blame the plant's death on me.  She went with improper watering schedule.  I told her I have an irrigation system.  She asked me how much water it is putting out, I responded, \"I don't know the exact output yet, but all the other plants are doing well which is a good indication.\"  And that was not good enough for her.  So, I just gave up.  It was clearly going to be an issue not worthy of the stress.

It's not our goal to make customers unhappy.  In this situation going through a 3rd party to place an order is not always the best thing to do. You mention you spent $95 on the arrangement but that's not what the sender gave us to work with. Also, out of the total, we had to take out for the 2 balloons and delivery charge that was associated with the order.  Yes, you could have got more flowers from Publix, but I don't sell Publix quality flowers. I only carry the freshest and finest.

As soon as the job was done and the sod laid I was very satisfied.  THEN IT RAINED.  I took pictures of the washed-out sod to the business and showed it to one of the landscapers.  He immediately said they did not put pins in the sod so it washed away.  I then went into the office and showed MR. IRBY.  He said he could fix it for over $1000.\nI stated that since it was his workers' error it should not be that much.  He and I agreed to $800 to fix.  I know.  Why should I have to pay anything? As of today, November 4, 2020, I have not gotten responses from e-mails or calls.  I still have a mess and have waited too late to resod because MR. IRBY did not keep his word.

He (Green Valley Nursery & Landscape) never showed up that day. I questioned him, & he acted like he was doing me a favor by fitting me into his busy schedule. Told me he\u2019d send a bobcat over to finish the job right then... I asked if the gravel was even at the job site, & he replied, \u201cI have no idea! Guess I better check.\u201d Wow! If that doesn\u2019t tell you how unprofessional they are, I don\u2019t know what does? Said he might be able to get the job done on Tuesday. I finally had him nail down a time for Friday, because I like a guaranteed job when I am paying for it. I felt like I had to babysit them to make sure the job would actually get done. Finally, the driveway was installed by people who are supposedly professionals. They literally just dropped off gravel & spread it out a bit. I\u2019m not a professional landscaper, but all the research we found said that the gravel needed to be plate compacted through the process. He said they don\u2019t do that, & he never promised me that. I only expected him to professionally & properly install a driveway... sorry, that\u2019s what I thought they were. Professionals. Nope. He refused to fix the job, even though I was promised I wouldn\u2019t have to pay until I was happy, & he would make it right. He told me he wanted to wash his hands of me, & wished I\u2019d never bothered him. The gravel in this driveway is so loose that the first rain will wash it all out, it\u2019s uneven, has a poorly graded slope that makes it hard to enter the drive without scraping the bottom of your car, & my husband couldn\u2019t fit his Jeep in the carport anymore because there was so much gravel under it. They refused to fix it at the present cost, & said they would plate compact it for another $500. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll bill you, don\u2019t pay it, & I\u2019ll send you to collections. We\u2019ll let the law handle it.\u201d Unbelievable & awful experience. My husband & I could\u2019ve done this job properly for as little as $700, but we decided to hire \u201cpros\u201d instead, & now, we are out $950, & it\u2019s not even done right... meaning more expenses for us now.
