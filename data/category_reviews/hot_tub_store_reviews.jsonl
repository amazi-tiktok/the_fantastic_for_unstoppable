I was told the owner is the only one that can change the sand or check plumbing. We'll thats fine as well except the owner never calls or even follows up behind his employees to make sure they are doing things properly ,this is important when your told well the pool boy is learning . The lady then tells me that WE need to shock and brush and backwash. So let me get this straight you want us to clean our pool while you are not there making your job easier so you can collect the cash. Surly I'm not the only one that sees a problem with me paying them for a service I am doing.

It wasn\u2019t the cheapest either, but you pay for what you get, or so we thought. So they come out to install Thursday before Memorial Day. While digging they find a \u201csink hole\u201d as they called it. It was an unfilled perc test. We filled it in that weekend and let them know. (This is NOT their fault, just setting up for the next two weeks it hasn\u2019t been dealt with.)That next week we are told the installation would resume. Later that week the installer said he would be out Friday and that someone needed to be there to sign \u201csink hole\u201d liability papers. Saturday comes still no show or call. So my husband calls the owner. We ask if we could get our money back, and husband tells him their contracted installer won\u2019t call or show up like he\u2019s promised several days to do. After that the installer calls immediately and says he will be out Monday. He comes for 30 minutes. He comes back Tuesday and digs it out and leaves because of weather ( didn\u2019t rain). Thursday my husband asks when we can expect him again. He gives another day and says once again he promised it would be up, my husband told him if he couldn\u2019t keep that commitment then we would find someone else. He told us to go ahead and find someone else. So, I go to the store front and speak to the lady in there. She was very defensive of the whole situation, said we couldn\u2019t have our money back because pools are special order. So I ask when it would get installed. She said she didn\u2019t know. Mathew would do it. She then told me the installer was in tears over us. I tried showing her the screenshots of the conversation to prove we weren\u2019t rude and was simply needing someone to come when they say. I asked to speak with the owner, she refused to give me his information and told me to leave or she was calling the police. I had my children with me who were scared she was saying that. I was not disrespectful. We left as requested. Still no word from anyone 5 hours later.

In beginning, the staff were extremely polite, courteous , knowledgeable  and pleasant to interact with. We picked out the pattern we wanted, and paid 50% of the total cost, to cover the  price of manufacturing the liner which, was very reasonable indeed. Steve came out in late December, to take the measurements of the pool, to pass onto the liner manufacturer. We then agreed to call Anders Pool, early March, to set a date to install the liner. I called Anders Pool, March 9th, and spoke with Steve, and set the date to install the new liner on Wednesday, March 27th. Steve touched base with me, a few days before the install date, to make sure we were good to go. Chris and two other staff, arrived early Wednesday, and drained the pool with a gas pump. They removed the old liner, thoroughly, and I mean thoroughly, cleaned, the pool walls and floors, smoothed over the pool floor and installed the new liner without any issues at all. Then, they set up a vacuum pump and a set a vacuum hose between the pool wall and the pool liner, to suck the trapped air out as we filled the pool from the faucet. The Anders pool liner installers, were extremely Professional and polite throughout the entire operation. They did a fantastic job, far, far, better than their local competition, that I'd used for the two previous liners, over the past 30 years. This liner fits snuggly up against the 4 ft. radius walls of the pool. Anders Pool, took the time, to accurately measure the pools dimensions. The previous pool company, when measuring up, rounded down the measurements, to get an even number. Which, resulted in a poor fitting liner. If you need a new pool liner, make sure you get a quote from Anders Pool Company. Trust me, they'll get you the best price and, the best quality liner, and the best possible installation. This company is well worth my 5 star rating.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b9030e73f55:0x77c49d0f0e266ebe"}

And of course we now have to pay someone else to do the tile job we already paid Swimming Pool Services for.\n\nSwimming Pool Services drained our fiberglass pool twice (tried for a 3rd before I told them to stop) without first sumping (we have a sump line - they indicated they didn\u2019t know what it was), they used no bracing any of the 2 times they drained our pool, and then left it empty during rainy days - look up \u2018drain fiberglass pool\u2019 to learn how terrible this all is. The whole time, they\u2019ve dismissed our concerns via long drawn out email back and forths and continue to assert that they did everything correctly and are trying to help. After they failed to make things right, I requested a refund, which they\u2019ve refused - they will only agree to keep sending guys out to redo portions of the job the same way that resulted in the problems that we have today. It's always worth mentioning that what was estimated to be a \"2 to 3 day job\" took more than a month - lots of no call/no show and terrible communication across the board. No thanks.\n\nI\u2019ve since spoken to multiple other local FIBERGLASS experts as well as the manufacturer, all of whom assert this was 100% NOT done correctly (with the owner and manager have simply dismissed this, acting as if we\u2019ve only learned info from the Internet. Despite every other expert and resource saying SPS is wrong, SPS continues to assert that they are the experts, even having gone as far as attacking other local businesses work). I\u2019ve been asked no less than 3 times \u201care you sure they were reputable?\u201d. The manufacture literally put me on speakerphone so everyone could hear my story, to which they responded with gasps, \u201coh my\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d. The warranty manager actually said \u201cit\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t have any remaining warranty because that would have definitely voided it - we wouldn\u2019t touch it now\u201d. I\u2019ve also been told that the tiles, grout and adhesive used for the job are incorrect for this size/shape/type of pool, which is something that SPS vehemently argues against - I\u2019ll attach some pictures of the current state of our pool so that you can be the judge for yourself.\n\nThe Manager (Dave) AND Owner (Glenn) will act as if they\u2019re trying to help, but it\u2019s seemingly just an act to keep things looking positive online (look here and at the BBB for examples). In conversations they remain friendly/polite, but will only offer to continue doing the very things that have led to us now having a damaged pool. I fully anticipate that the owner will follow up on all reviews acting as if they\u2019ve tried to make things right, just as he seemingly does on all negative reviews, but their idea of making things right is continuing to do things incorrectly - \u2018the customer is always wrong\u2019, seems to be their approach to customer service. No thanks.\n\nUnfortunately there\u2019s a max character count for reviews, so I can\u2019t share everything - though I will be elsewhere.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t allow these guys to put a bag of salt in my pool going forward.\n\nUpdate based on owner's claims:\n- The response, as expected, is full of misleading statements in an attempt to come across more helpful than is actually the case.\n- I turned them away ONCE, not several times. I turned them away because they refused to proceed with repairs without 100% draining my pool and indicated that properly bracing it was out of the question.\n- Notice he's not mentioning the 'remedy' that they proposed? Because they didn't propose a remedy. They said they would 100% drain my pool, and would not brace it - which is actually the opposite of a remedy.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWFp0EfHj0oSG3ApdvzMCI-80MWmgJqno06aEE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4tjuqvHvrZEA5bY-MTV8G8oir5Z0Iv8cYzC8K=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOokYi54tLnNqMDkPCSmSNJeG9E7ld1w77GtA2R=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_9RUO7otQifznO9h9uUp-qHfdspKF1zWj_yZP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRB_x9TPBN3U87jCmN-8mL89RSnax0kerjyxbl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpjtsEvUANahj3v54DKdWZNW6A4o7RaMjPINIw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeiwPiGcL3HpVwZB2Ivtop56JpIE9fTggW-e4y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSN89--TjXMUceMLKEvQc0Y-iKMm5BBho0Sa7d=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI-zJ2OcILKZGHMe4cqdKmz1M438l2gTyJSJBH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1544041452230, "text": "Matt, I am sorry that you feel this way and felt it necessary to resort to social media!

Also, I was told multiple times by your staff that YOU would call me or when I would call back to try to get you they would tell me something you said so I know there was some communication going on.

We can't be responsible for chemical dosages used when we are not given the proper gallons for your pool. Our dosages given are all based on information that is supplied by our customers unless we send a Technician out to the pool to measure and get accurate volumns. My staff in an effort to help after getting the proper size of your pool did in fact give you chemicals at no charge to treat. My understanding is that you wanted a continuing supply of chemicals at no charge. We make every effort to ensure that you have what you need and are very conservative when dosing a pool typically, however in this case the overdosing was not something we could control based on the information that we had. Social media and review sites are an easy way to try to hurt a smalll business when we are trying to do the right things. If you would like to discuss now that I know you would like to speak with me offline please send a contact number to my email at gij@swimmingpoolservices.net and I assure you that I will call you to discuss.

We had been using Swimming Pool Services (SPS) since we moved into our home in 2008. They opened and closed our pool each season and we bought our chemicals for our pool and hot tub from them as well. The last few years, the service began to drop. When we called to complain, we were told it's hard finding good help. In Oct 2012, we bought a hot tub from them. In Oct 2016, the hot tub quit running. When the repairman came out, he said we needed to buy a new pump. After waiting a few days for SPS to give us an estimate on a new pump, my wife called the maker of the hot tub, Shoreline Dynasty Spa, and got an estimate from them. We decided to try to fix it ourselves and took the pump to Alabama Pump and Supply who fixed it for much less. We then reinstalled it. After reinstalling the pump, we decided to move the spa a few feet and called SPS and were told Glen would call us back shortly as he was on a job. I waited until 2 PM. When I called back, I was told they wouldn't be able to help us until sometime the next week. TIME TO MOVE ON. We had experienced poor service many times over the years, but weren't sure who to use.
