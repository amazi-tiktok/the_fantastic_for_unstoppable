They didn't answer the call light earlier and he needed to use the restroom. They were unwilling to help and told her they weren't \"trained\" for that.  They had been helping him prior to that as it was part of his rehabilitation not to mention his dignity.  My sister was offered absolutely no assistance and had to help him herself.

Then, as we were leaving after an afternoon visit, the director of nursing came out to the parking lot and had a very non-hipaa compliant conference with us about my family member's care outside in the open in front of whoever happened to be walking by.  She tried to rationalize why the employees there would not offer to help my family member.  I was embarrassed for her and walked off.  My sister needed help.  Not one employee offered to assist her.  Any prudent compassionate person in a similar situation would have helped.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888910f661fbbe1b:0x44d09ccda56ec317"}

Since posting this review, I've had a few lengthy conversations with a couple of the \"head\" personnel  at St Martin's. We have come to a mutual agreement and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am NOT removing or changing anything in my initial review, so one must proceed with care and make sure EVERYTHING is explained to you in its entirety.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a LONG read, if I could rate with less than 1 star, I would, but this NEEDS to be shared!!! NEVER USE ST MARTIN'S FOR IN HOME CARE!!!!!!! I recently had to have major back surgery, and as I have no local family, I opted to use St Martin's \"in home care\".  I have NEVER used this type of service EVER, and I must say I was COMPLETELY taken advantage of and the service was HORRENDOUS . Because, I had never used this service,  I had hoped that they would understand my needs and assist me in setting this up. Oh they SET ME UP all right.  TWENTY FOUR HOUR SERVICE, even while I was in the hospital for TWO weeks.  The hospital did not let them do ANYTHING. (Hospital policy), so ALL they could do was SIT there, maybe assist in putting on those \"stupid hospital socks\" , cover me when I got chilled and uncover me when I warmed up. I had NO idea that I could PICK AND CHOOSE when I needed them. I was left with the impression that once I started their service, that I was STUCK with them until I was released by the surgeon.\nI KNEW that I would need help once I returned home, but NOT 3- 8 hour shifts. I was in the hospital almost 2 weeks and during that time the program manager was to set up my in home care. I informed her that I did NOT want a parade of different faces coming into my home. TWO WEEKS, she had to get a \"team\" put together. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN!!! When I returned home; A DIFFERENT person almost every day AND some shifts not even covered. How could I heal, if I had to STRESS every day about my care?? This is MY home, I was not capable of moving around, so I couldn't very well see what was happening around my home. The 11pm till 7 am shift was the WORST! I did NOT require anyone to WATCH me while I slept, so I PAID A LOT OF MONEY for these sitters to SLEEP, WATCH TV, AND TALK/PLAY ON THEIR CELL PHONES while I slept.\nI know that the sitters were supposed to be bonded/insured, BUT how did I know things weren't moving out of my house. YES, I have trust issues with strangers, but that is NOT the point. The POINT IS... The \"Care At Home\" program is NOT SET UP CORRECTLY, THE PROGRAM MANAGER IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL TRAINED IN HER DUTIES,( I heard that she hasn't been doing this long)  AND I, THE CLIENT,  feel TOTALLY abused and \"taken for a MONEY ride\".\nI could rant on & on, but I AM DONE!! I truly hope that this review opens up some eyes at St Martin's AND future clients.  <1 star!! HORRIBLE! NO EXCUSE!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888910f661fbbe1b:0x44d09ccda56ec317"}

But anyway, I was scheduled for an MRI and didn't realize how claustrophobic I was until the day of.  I immediately left the hospital and came back to  the office and explained to the nurse the issue I had.  Her was response was we can only give you one pill. First of all, I was new patient and they know nothing about me.  I hate taking medicine, but I was desperate to find out what is wrong with my arm.  I have been on the same job for 16 years and only have to go to the doctor twice because of job related issues.  When I initially met Dr. Determann he seemed like he really wanted to find out what was going on as well. After getting the MRI he only saw a small spot and started saying his office wasn't in to do pain management and that I was able to go back to work as normal lifting same amount weight.  He also stated that I should not be on light duty.  The medicine he prescribed for me made me drowsy and I could not function, so I brought it back and asked the nurse to dispose of them. He mentioned physical therapy and it's been over a week and I have not heard from the office for an appointment.  He mentioned making a referral appointment to see a rheumatologist and I have not received an appointment yet.  It's sad to me for someone to assume and stereotype instead of giving me a real solution other than medicine. This small spot has had me off work for almost six weeks and the office would not even fill out fmla papers so I didn't have to use up all my annual leave.  Dr. Determann told me I had to go the physician that referred me to him for them to complete the paperwork. This really bothered me, so I went to Dr. Goldman at the Daphne received a much simpler solution that gave some much needed relief the next day.  Some people are actually hurting and not after a prescription.  I don't want to be contacted by email, text, calls, or any form of communication from this office.  I have already told some of my family and friends Do Not Come to this office in Fairhope.  The staff and environment in Daphne was like night and day.

The response was \"we don't do miracles.\" Mom had TWO UTIs while there. The second time we came close to the room on Sunday to a foul smell.  I checked to see if she was wet. She was wet and the pad beneath her was wet as well. They sent a culture of urine to be tested on Monday; the result was that she had a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). By Wednesday they were awaiting prescription orders for her treatment.  My mother in law was transferred from there to another facility the next Tuesday. The UTI was still not treated. The facility where we had her transferred handled the UTI immediately. Dementia gets worse when there is an infection or UTI. She's Diabetic: they told me that they don't have a diabetic diet there to give patients. Well, I asked them not to give her sugar, caffeine, and pork. Her sugar was as high as 300+. When she was home, 118 was the highest unless she cheated then 220. She never took insulin shots; she got them there because they sent it up high with the bad diet, then gave insulin to bring it back down. Diabetic patients are groggy or sleepy when their glucose is up. According to them, she doesn't respond to commands. DUH if her glucose is high and she has a UTI, what the heck do they expect?

I went to see the physical therapists at J&H in hopes of fixing the underlying issue, not just relieving the pain.  Believe it or not, my injury and pain were resolved after my first visit!  Ethan saw me and diagnosed and treated underlying issue which i had never expected, and after a short session I left with an appointment to return in a week.  The next day I started to realize that my pain was gone and I was beginning to feel good again.  Thanks J&H, and thank you Ethan, for getting me well again.  Highly recommended!!!

Communication was non-existent from staff. Things were regularly stolen out of our father's room, clothing and food gifts would disappear. Would not recommend this facility to anyone that cares about their loved one.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1505843275837, "text": "Thank you for your feedback.

He also suggested supplements to take and specific foods to either avoid or eat more of to achieve a completely healthy and balanced body. It's amazing the things that chiropractic care can help with that don't even appear to be related until you remember that your nerves control everything and all your nerves are connected to the spine.

I didn't see the chiropractor stationed there, but I was seen by a fill-in female chiropractor from a nearby HealthSource. The staff were very nice, informative, and answered all of my questions. Immediately, they took X-Rays and said they would be contacting me after they review my records. It took them one day to call back, which amazed me. I returned and was quickly given an estimated cost for 25 sessions, after insurance was applied. The amount for the sessions was way out of my budget range, so I never became an official patient. But that is the ONLY reason I did not seek help from this establishment. Aside from cost, everything else was easy, and again, I can't say enough about the staff there. They were excellent.

I had back surgery in 2009 (L5-S1 discectomy) and was strongly discouraged from running by a PT I saw after my surgery.  I had been feeling pretty good getting back into it, but was worried about possible injury both to my back and knees.  Andrew's running assessment and subsequent muscle strength assessment were extremely helpful.  He gave me a couple of things to change while running to help prevent injury and a list of stretches to strengthen my leg and core muscles.  A few weeks ago I ran my very first half marathon.  A few weeks before that, I had tweaked my back doing something stupid and was afraid I was going to have to give up running the half.  I emailed Andrew who encouraged me that all was not lost.  With his expert advice, I not only ran the whole way, but ran faster than I was expecting!  I have since run a 10K and have 2 more half marathons and a 10-miler on the horizon.\n\nSeriously, make an appointment with Andrew!  For anything!  Not just if you're a runner or athlete.  He can help with normal (and not so normal) life pains, post-surgery issues, etc.  Not only is he knowledgeable about how the body works, but he also takes the time to explain the whats and whys and hows.  My only complaint is that he lives in Alabama while I'm in Colorado and therefore I can't very easily make appointments with him!  So all of you North-Alabamians, take advantage of how close he is to you and let him help you!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496404005159, "text": "Thanks for the review Polly!

Instead of going 3 days a week for several weeks (which is really hard to do if you are working), I was set up over a longer period of time (once a week, then twice a month, then 4 weeks/6 weeks later).  The phone exercise app he provides, allows me to track the exercises I have to do.  He is very encouraging especially at times when I think I'm not making any progress and teaches you self release methods to relieve pain.  I am now into my 4th month of therapy  (6th visit) and I'm running again!  My hip feels stronger and I'm looking forward to many more miles on trails and roads in the future.  Andrews approach does take self motivation because you have to do the work on your own rather than at office setting for an hour 3 days a week.  But being pain free is a great motivator.

I had bought my Trifecta Pass just a few weeks prior after assuring myself that I would recover in time to race.  After weeks of ineffective self care I went to my family doctor. After an X-ray and no real good advice they referred me to an orthopedic doctor. He confirmed I didn\u2019t have anything major and gave me the same useless advice and a prescription ointment that didn\u2019t do much. By this time it was all I could do to walk around the house. I was heartbroken to think that I wouldn\u2019t be able to race. Thankfully I found Andrew through his insightful Facebook posts and gave him a call last January. His wholistic and long term vision for getting better and staying better was exactly what I was looking for. The running analysis he provided revealed so many things that could have stalled my fitness goals indefinitely had they been left unaddressed.  I travel a lot for work as well, so his \u201cwork on your own\u201d method for physical therapy exercises rather than multiple visits per week was a perfect way for me to augment my existing exercise routine without disrupting my work schedule. By March I was able to finish the Atlanta Sprint race - still walking more than I wanted but at least I was on the course and it only took about 30 minutes more than usual.  After about 5 or 6 visits I had made good progress and was on my way to pain free running. By July I was able to run the Asheville Super and only had to pace myself a bit on the downhill portion towards the end of the race.  In August I started having shin splints.  I reached out to Andrew via Facebook Messenger and within an hour had a new set of exercises that took care of the problem in a few weeks.  No \u201cmake an appointment with the receptionist\u201d or other nonsense like that.  The last time I had shin splints they lingered for months and the only advice I got from my doctor was to take a few Advil every day and stop exercising - not an option for me. Now in November I was able to run the Carolina Beast without any pain.  Achieving this goal would not have happened without Andrew\u2019s help and seemed impossible when I was limping out of the store with a knee brace last December.\nAt first I was worried about not being able to have insurance cover my therapy. In retrospect, the investment I made with PhysioWorks is going to save me so much money in the long run.  Andrew\u2019s approach was exactly what this Spartan needed to finally join the Trifecta Tribe.  If you\u2019re an Obstacle Course Racer and have any pain that\u2019s keeping you off the course, I highly recommend you give PhysioWorks a try. Andrew works with a local Crossfit business as well, so he can help with more than just running.\nThanks Andrew!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509839627753, "text": "Thanks Tag!

I saw Andrew at Physioworks about a month ago now. I'm a non-formally trained regular runner with several halves and one full marathon, so far, under my belt. Previous to going to Physioworks I had suffered from regular occurring achilles tendinopathy and strains to my gastrocnemious muscle. Andrew was able to shed light on several corrections I could make to improve my form and methods. After roughly 30 minutes of range of motion and strength testing, I got on the treadmill for a running assessment. Andrew showed me several things about my stride that I could improve; everything from how my feet were falling to how my torso was positioned while running. After the appointment Andrew gave me several strengthening exercises for my weak muscle groups and left me with some invaluable tools advice to improve both my time and endurance. I am so thankful for the opportunity to have had this done.

No husband of 66 years holding her hand.  No children or grandchildren at her bedside.  We were in the parking lot being\ncondescended to.  We were being offered a \u201cglance through a window\u201d moments before being told, in a parking lot, that she was gone.  If the roles had been reversed and any human being had tried to stop my Mother from being at the side of her loved ones as The final breath were drawn: No Earthbound force could  have stopped the Power of Love that coursed through that remarkable woman.  She would have been at my side.  I am a weaker soul than she.  I tried diplomacy.  My cries fell on ears so consumed with ego and a sense of power that the only meaningful response from the tyrant who dared only speak with me via speakerphone was  \u201c...that\u2019s how we\u2019re doing it.  That\u2019s off our best judgement.\u201d\nI posted a video on social media prior to Mother\u2019s passing, after the phone conversation, asking for support from friends and others in the community.  The calls that they place were met with hostility, rudeness, and empty promises of \u201cthe administrator will get back in touch with you\u201d.  As those phone calls were coming in and my sister was being told of Momma\u2019s passing, I was receiving cold, disdainful stares by the only staff member who could even bring herself to look in my direction.\nThere is no way this injustice can be reversed.  This beautiful creature whose pastor said in his eulogy \u201c... was a beautiful soul.  It was my privilege to be her pastor and to be her friend.  I'm not sure that I've ever known anyone who had so much love, so concentrated, deep within her being.  Every interaction I've ever had with Carolyn was permeated with love.\u201d This giant of a giver.  This Child if God.  My Mother.  I cannot change the final moments of her life.  I can, however, see that her story is told.  I can see that these individuals who slither through this life generating pain and sorrow need not be concerned if they are alone.  I couldn\u2019t be there for Momma on that day but with God as my witness, until I draw my last breath, I will live as a reminder to those who tried to diminish her that She lives in me.

My daughter was the first of us to use Dr. Mann.  She came in for really bad neck pain and headaches.  Dr. Mann said it was related to what is now being called 'text neck.' In two weeks of treatment she was completely better! Not only that it's been months now and she feels great- and still playing on that phone! The second patient was my son.  We were told he needed tubes in his ears because he had chronic ear infections for months.  It broke my heart thinking about that so I was chatting with Dr. Mann on one of my daughters visits and he told Chiropractic can be successful in treating that without tubes. So we gave it a try (child adjustments are different and very gentle if you didn't know) and low and behold after months of ear infections they were COMPLETELY gone.  We were thrilled- not to mention we saved hundreds avoiding surgery.  The next patient was me!  I do pure Barre and I was having trouble with my low back and knee.  It turns out that I had mobility issues.  Couple weeks of work and my workout is now a breeze. And finally my husband.  He's had back issues before but not quite like this recent one.  He works at a computer all day.  This time the sciatica was going all the way to his foot.  He is currently finishing up his rehabilitation with Dr. Mann and is already pain free!  I am so glad we came here first! No pain, no drugs, we feel great, and at a fraction of the price of surgery.

It looks like it's been said her a 100 times but I wanted to say why my treatments here allow me to say how much I mean that and miss being in Alabama!  I spend most of the year in Atlanta now because of work.  I have tried and tried to find a chiropractor here that was as good as Dr. Mann but I haven't been successful.  I called Dr. Mann before one of my appointments in Atlanta and asked if he would mind talking to my chiropractor (bless him for doing that) Even after an in depth conversation about the type of treatments I was receiving with Dr. Mann in Decatur I still wasn't getting the same level of relief from my Atlanta chiropractor that I was receiving at Advanced Chiropractic.  My neck is just not the same when I go to other places.  I only get to be adjusted a few times a year by Dr. Mann now because of the move and it's one of the worst things about not being home.  But every time  I am in town seeing Dr. Mann is on the list!  Another thing I always appreciated about Dr. Mann's office is there is always a plan.  He doesn't just say 'see ya' at the end of your appointment.  If I am working on an injury I always know when I need to be seen again.  If I am on wellness I know I need to be back monthly.  Other places I have been don't give any direction and it just seems less professional.  Be thankful for what you have here!!! He's the best!

I'm a fan of all things wellness and am a believer that the chiropractor can save you from surgery. I am also very picky about the places I go for treatment and advice. I had just relocated to the area for work.  My supervisor had also just moved here and said I should give this place a try.  I called ahead and asked about the services provided and some questions about my new insurance.  I had my appointment that evening.  The office is more modern looking than some of the other places in town (past experience has taught me sometimes old building means outdated doctor). The staff and doctors are all nice people and I can without a doubt say that was the best treatment I have ever been given.  My last chiropractor was a good friend and great person but was a smaller build. Just guessing but I think that really was the difference in treatments and let me tell you it was significant.

Like I said in just a couple weeks I could see the changes. I used 2 feel tingling from my back almost weekly. I now haven't felt it in weeks.

When I left, I felt like a new person. My only regret was not coming to see Dr. Mann sooner!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886284764f6fef61:0x2058cd07a41eab07"}

Attempted to realign a part of my body that didn't need it and when he was done after 6 minutes in the room with me he managed to not fix the issue at all now I'm out over $100.00 and absolutely  no relief for a simple pinched nerve, oh but he did set me up on the \"maintenance plan\" which is 3 visits a week at $65 per visit that's $780 a month! That's more then my mortgage for what every single other chiropractor has been able to fix and treat in one visit for under $50.00. Please be wise and heed this as a warning. I do not recommend this place for anyone. They may be a legal D.C. but it's as close to a scam ad you can get legally.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546567115350, "text": "Kris- you are being dishonest. Health expenses without insurance can be tough, but that is no excuse for your dishonesty in your review. Cameras show your time in the office was approximately 40 minutes; less than 5 minutes in the waiting room- standard for any first visit. Furthermore, we offer the lowest cash prices for new patients in town and also very flexible payment plans.  You were told the prices before you came in. Our cameras even show you were in high spirits until it was time to pay your bill.  And instead of talking to us and working out a payment plan we watched you go into your car and leave this angry review.  Also, what you tried to tell us was \u2018wrong\u2019 with you was actually incorrect and probably the main reason you\u2019ve had to deal with your back pain for years instead of actullay being \u2018fixed.\u2019 While we have great respect for you and your field, you have to remember- you are not a doctor-  for instance a chiropractor in a car accident should heed the EMT\u2019s instructions because that is what they have been trained to do.  You are also confusing your terminology- maintenance is for wellness patients- and is an optional once a month visit for those who have complete their \u2018rehab\u2019 plan to help stay ahead of injuries and reduce wear and tear on the body. Rehab plans are what you were trying to quote. Certain injuries take time to heal and a proper plan for recovery. You are absolutely right Kris- We do things different at Advanced Chiropractic.  We get so many patients who have seen chiropractors that take shortcuts to treat their injuries and the patient continues to deal with pain for years.  Our goal at Advanced Chiropractic is to HEAL the injury. We have found that if we simply make pain go away we are no different than a pain killer or opiate.  However, with our custom made rehabilitation plans you can escape that continued damage, year after year, which is so important as many parts of the body don\u2019t grow back when you repeatedly injure them."}, "gmap_id": "0x886284764f6fef61:0x2058cd07a41eab07"}

The folks in the rehab department seemed earnest in their effort and my mother actually thought they were very nice. The doctor/nursing aspect is a totally different matter that seems to operate on providing the minimal care and effort.  If you have a loved one at this facility, you need to pay attention to the needs of your family member.  When I noticed fungal growth on my mother's hand, I called it out.  The nurse told me that the doctor determined it to be a callous. They then promised they would apply fungal cream. I left on business for two weeks and when I returned, her entire hand was covered is what appeared as crusted skin and had spread to her other hand and face.  Only after I raised it to their attention did they start to address the situation. I mean no one seems to have noticed it before this?   It turned out to be scabies which means that she required isolation and likely infected other in the facility.\n\nThere were a few other matters such as trash on the floor of her room, the fact they couldn't hang up her clothes, and that when they put her on an air mattress, they shoved the other mattress into the bathroom preventing any access to the bathroom.\n\nA few days later, she fell out of bed. Supposedly she slid off of the air mattress.   They sent her to the emergency room for precaution.  Although she sustained no injuries, the hospital kept my mother as she had a bacterial infection causing her white blood count to be extremely high.\n\nThe management staff was nice, and the rehab people seemed genuinely engaged.  Some of the nursing staff were conscientious but to ignore a situation that was clearly out of control and in need of medical attention is inexcusable.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862133a7685b99d:0x29b04ab624a44d28"}

From day one I have been impressed and amazed at the level of care she has received.  Mary is 90 years old and in very good health.  Up until her fall, on November 7, 2013, she and her 93 year old husband had been living in their home with the help of a care giver who was with them during the day. ( 8 a.m. - 4 p.m. )  On the evening of Nov. 7th Mary fell and broke her pelvis.  Her GP doctor put her on pain meds and sent her home.  We arranged for 24/7 care for her at home, but within a week after her fall she became listless and stopped eating, sleeping and dehydration was setting in.  An ambulance ride to Crestwood Hospital ER was arranged & she was admitted for 3 days/nights of intensive care to bring her pain under control & getting her back to eating and sleeping normally again.  The admitting Dr. recommended The Kindred Transitional Care & Rehabilitation Center quite highly.\n\nFrom the first moment I walked into Whitesburg Gardens until this evening, two weeks later, I have felt completely at peace with our decision to have Mary under the care of the caring folks at this rehabilitation facility.

I never imagined the experience would become so personal.  At my first visit, I met with Robby to discuss all my issues.  He has a genuine nature, a respect for where you are in the process, and a drive to see you return to wellness.  He took the time to evaluate me and was methodical in his design of a plan that worked not only in the clinic but could be transitioned to home. He championed me through tough times with kindness, professionalism, and a warmth that led to a trust which is necessary for the recovery process to be successful.  He is a credit to his profession and an asset to TherapySouth.\nThroughout the following weeks, I worked with Abbey.  Abbey is truly a pioneer in her field.  She is focused and attentive during every session, kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, and helpful.  When I was doubtful, she was always there to encourage me, being honest with me about the challenges I would face, yet reassuring me that I would one day be able to return to a life filled with many athletic endeavors.  Abbey is understanding and genuinely takes a personal interest in how you're feeling.  She always made sure to explain every exercise in depth and also how it would aid in my progress going forward.  I feel lucky to have been guided by Abbey along my PT journey, for it was her encouragement that pushed me through when I was at my lowest.\nHannah is also extremely helpful and efficient.  Being the face you see when you first walk in, she is cheerful and always greets the patients by name.  TherapySouth has an amazing team and, more importantly, great teamwork.  It is modern and very nice, clean, and an extremely well-run practice.  I couldn't be happier with my experience with something I wasn't at all looking forward to.\nThank you to the TherapySouth team for always answering my questions with interest and patience.

Amanda has cared for every member of my family, from my mom, husband, three year old son, and newborn. Amanda is great with kids and my son LOVES visiting \"Dr. Amanda\". He has no clue he is getting adjusted because he is having so much fun with her. When my husbands back locked up the week of Christmas, Amanda worked him in ASAP despite her holiday schedule. Because of his weekly adjustments, my husband is able to run again, which he hasn't been able to do in years because of his back pain. Amanda also cared for me throughout my pregnancy. I give her credit for my easy delivery! After my daughters birth, she adjusted my newborn and it helped with her colic. You could see the relief in her face after an adjustment.\nAmanda's office staff is friendly and she and her staff are constantly going out of their way to provide excellent customer service. Whether it's scheduling an appointment, or needing to bring the kids with me, the staff is always helpful.\nOne thing that stands out about Amanda's chiropractic care which separates her from other chiropractors, is she is always going to seminars and learning the latest techniques. She is very passionate about what she does and wants to provide the best care possible. If you pick Health Source for your chiropractic care, you will not be disappointed!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862119014dbef8f:0x3b1449421ce751ca"}

I was impressed with his knowledge and ability in the area of health and fitness. Elliott is all about community. He's played a huge role in helping me establish my non-profit, Scarlett's Closet . He's even a member of my board.\nLast year, after attending one of the fundraisers Live Ready hosts for us annually, I saw pictures of myself at the event and realized I needed to take control of my life and be the healthiest version of Lisa I can be. I started doing workouts in my home and making better food choices. By May of this year, I'd lost 41Lbs, but the scales had stopped moving. I reached out to Elliott and he told me I was most likely in a calorie deficit.  I recall my response; I laughed at him. He encouraged me to sign up for  a \"Love to Eat Challenge\" Through this challenge, I was taught what to eat and how my plate should look. I am happy to report that I won the challenge and to date, I have lost 64lbs. I am wearing the smallest clothes I've ever worn as an adult. I recently had surgery and  Elliott has asked me to start training with him once my Doctor clears me to do so.  In the past, I would have said, \"No way.\" Now, I have the confidence I need to accept the challenge.\nIf you are looking to make positive changes in your life, I urge you to contact Elliott and his team. They are not only the best at what they do, but some of the nicest and most encouraging people you will ever meet. You won't feel pressured or intimidated.

That's $1440 for a year. I think what turned me away was the amount of willingness to work with folks like myself, whom are rarely here due to work. It was pretty clear that $120 was the price and nothing less than military orders would change that. Even then the offer sounded less than ideal. So, that's the business side.\n\nThe workout side of this facility seemed... Alright. The facility was great as were the staff and customer personalities and support. Going back to the money, I definitely don't believe the training I saw warranted the price. I saw more flexion in lower back than I care to see-not just from young/new members. My fear of CrossFit gyms is always seeing atrocious form, and although that wasn't the case here (form wasn't... Terrible...) It still wasn't good enough for the hefty price. I could get a personal coach for the same and get precise, individual training for less money and same or better quality.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507482201039, "text": "We are so sorry to hear that you do not agree with the price we charge.

We also realize that people\u2019s form are less then perfect but everyone comes in moving different, with different mobility problems and different degrees of fitness and athleticism.

I found Jason when I was around 35 because I was working a job that required alot of lifting and carrying of a 28 foot extention ladder over long distances about 15 times a day. I had gotten to the point that it caused me such pain to even bend over to tie my shoes that I couldn't take it.\n\nI found Dr Hart at Sturbridge on Taylor Rd. I saw him therethere for a few years and I followed him after he left to start his own practice because he was the most skilled Chiropractor I had ever been to see, but also because of his regard for people and how he saw the way their wallets and insurance plans were treated. What I mean there without going into a full out explanation is, Dr Jason Hart is one of those doctors you rarely find, he cares much more about you and your well being than he does about your wallet.\n\nI'm 45 now and had it not been for Jason and the lengths he goes to for his patients/friends, to learn his craft inside and out like no other.....well I would still be suffering day to day with a great deal of pain.

My lack of knowledge caused my mother a lot of neglect and humiliation. There is a ton I could say but I\u2019m going to narrow it down to four:\n1. My mom called me one day around 730pm and stated she had been calling for someone to come change her diaper since 3:30pm.\n2. My mom suffers from CHF and needs a low sodium diet. Whatever she would chose from her REGULAR menu to eat, the kitchen would send her whatever they wanted her to have. Usually something processed and high in salt. Now my mother retains fluid very badly.\n3. After seeing other areas of neglect, I researched better facilities and put in to transfer my mother. I put the request in, in person on a Thursday morning. I came back Friday afternoon and it had not been send. I checked on it Monday evening it was finally sent. Then there was the transportation issue, the family pays, WHAT no one told me. Well Magnolia social services didn\u2019t help me, nor did they offer guidance or contact numbers. So I called the transfer NEW facility and admissions said \u201cwe will take care of this for you and we will get you the lowest price possible, we will try to make this transition smooth\u201d. About 15 Min later I was set with transportation.\n4. They are always short staff, once my mother had a very bad case of heart burn. She pushed her button for help, a hour later mom called me and I called the nurses  desk. The supervisor came, took her BP, said she will be back with some tums. An hour later Mom pushed the button. No one came. She called me, I called the desk, the new shift nurse said the supervisor WENT HOME! So I got dress and went to the store and drove from the South side to Gardendale to take mom some heartburn meds.\n\nWhen you enter Magnolia Ridge the smell of OLD urine and bowels will meet you at the door and it lingers in the hallways. Whenever I leave the building that smell is stuck to my clothes.\n\nIf you put your love ones in this facility \u201cYOU BETTA CHECK ON THEM DAILY\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889043c16246da9:0x49264155c51aeb0"}

My entire life, I\u2019ve had one person be able to pop my back well until this point.\n\nThe staff is absolutely amazing as well. They are always welcoming and encouraging. They truly care about their patients. The thoroughness the whole staff exhibits is also shocking. They make sure everything is covered and you leave without pain. They ask after every session if it was okay. They are helpful, kind, and patient when I am confused or struggling. They also remember little details about my personal life and ask me about them every time I\u2019m there. It makes me feel more comfortable while I\u2019m there.\n\nOverall, this has been, is, and will hopefully continue to be the best experience of my life.

The office manager at this business is ABSOLUTELY THE MOST RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL PERSON I HAVE EVER SPOKEN TOO. I came in probably 7 months ago, It was my first visit to ever see a chiropractor, and was in a lot of pain. I paid like $150-$175  that day just because I told them SPECIFICALLY that I did not want a bill in the mail and I would pay whatever that day just to go ahead and get it out of the way. I saw Dr. Jumper and he was very nice and helpful. I thought that I was going to be very pleased with my experience. 6 MONTHS LATER, I received a bill in the mail from them asking me for $35. Soon after I received the bill in the mail I gave them a call to ask some questions about my bill. She began to tell me that I still owed $35 and that the lady that I was working with got fired because of doing stuff like this and not charging me the full amount. I begin to tell her what I paid that day and I asked specifically if I could take care of it the day of the visit. I then asked her if she could just take care of it for me because it was not my mistake it was the employees. Her tone immediately changed and she said \"You still have to pay your bill regardless and if you don't we will be reporting you to collections.\" I tried to explain to her that I am a loyal customer and I just do not think it is right for me to have to pay this and she kept talking over me and raising her voice. THEN, SHE HUNG UP ON ME. Today I receive a phone call from the business and I was on the other line and could not answer, and immediately call back, and no answer. The point of the matter is, IF YOU ARE RUNNING A LOCAL BUSINESS, YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE YOUR CLIENTELE. IF AN EMPLOYEE DOES SOMETHING WRONG, YOU DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED. REGARDLESS. If you are looking for a local chiropractor DO NOT go to this business unless you are wanting to get SCAMMED.

Both were done by the same surgeon. My first surgery was in November of 2015. I did physical therapy at another Hoover clinic (not a therapy south) and I grew to hate physical therapy, physical therapists, anything associated with them. I honestly believed the profession was a crock because of the poor care I had received at that clinic. I didn\u2019t know any better! My hip never got better, it was much weaker than before, and three years later, is still in pain and lacking the function I had prior. My skepticism towards physical therapy as it turns out, was just because I went to the wrong place. After a shoulder surgery in May of 2016, I was referred to Chris and Corey from a friend and my outlook could not be more different now. Not only did they cater my shoulder rehab to my specific sport (weightlifting), they also helped me repair my hip and alleviate some of my pain. I\u2019m a true believer in physical therapy now, even going as far as changing my career path so I can also change someone\u2019s outlook.
