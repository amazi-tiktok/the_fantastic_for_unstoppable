Captain Michael Thomas and deck hand (Blake) went out of their way to make it a perfect day.  They put us on the fish immediately.  If we spent a few minutes with no bites he was quick to move us to a better spot.  The deck hand (Blake) was so attentive.  Us girls never had to touch bait or wait for bait.  He was always ready and we kept him very busy.  They were fun to spend the day with even if we hadn\u2019t caught fish.  When it was time to head back in the captain saw a spot with great potential for Mahi-mahi so he had us drop some lines.  My boys were sooo excited to catch mahi-mahi, king mackerel and lots of red snapper.  We will definitely go on this boat again!
