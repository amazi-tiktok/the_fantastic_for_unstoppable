DONT GO TO ABC OR ABC SPIRITS or whatever that place is called - thats on 231. I mean its good but so far NO liquor store has compared to this one. Just come here. TRUST. ME.\n\nFull Review:\nI just went here for the first time today. As in just left. I loved this place SO SO SO MUCH. I was telling myself I must do a review as soon as I get home. What this place has to offer is so much! I just bought soju from there! And it was not terribly price. The only place I could find it was at a Korean restaurant (that was called Kalim Garden. And I would buy unopened bottles from them. I also got 2 different bottles of sake. Which I couldn't be more happy about! There is White Claw here. They still have it in stock despite the fact that there is currently a shortage. The guy inside (I didn't get his name was so friendly. This is also a place you can get CBD & vape products. I actually bought a pack of prerolles hempettes. It looked like they have 4 brands to choose from. I have tried a lot of the hempette brands and listen to me!! - just buy the red pack. Stunna Bubba Kush. I have tried the other ones pure hemp is pretty good but there are a lot stems in it even tho they claim theres not, wild hemp brand is just...really tame. Flavor is worst than the \"Pure Hemp\" brand. So that's usually just what ive been forced to get around here. HOWEVER I am currently smoking one of these Stunnas. The flavor - very good. Would rate 4/5 bc its good but it is def no premium ish. Stem wise give a 3/5 I'm hearing tons of little pops.... But nothing like the Pure Hemp brand. Price I give 5/5 stars. This one was $13.99 I think. The other brands I have mentioned were $9.99. Which is typical but very decently priced compared to other hemp shops ive been to. So just pay the extra $4 for the red one if you are interested.\n\nAlso as for how the store looks and atmosphere wise - AMAZING. hate that google is a 5 star system bcuz that for sure is a 10 star - no 11 stars for the atmosphere of the place. Employee also seems to be very knowledgeable although I didnt have to ask many questions bc I knew what I was going for and know my alcohol. But they had things in there I have never tried before. So that excited me a lot.\n\nI will be putting the TLDR at the top of my review as well in case no one reads this novella of a review. \ud83d\ude02 but if you need to go to a liquor store. DONT GO TO ABC OR ABC SPIRITS or whatever that place is called - thats on 231. I mean its good but so far NO liquor store has compared to this one. Just come here. TRUST.

I look on their Facebook page and see that a few other people have had to deal with the same thing.

My husband and I have been taking advantage of  the early hours for seniors for some time.  I was unable to go today due to my health.  My son drove from our town at 6:30 in the morning for early shopping with my husband. When they arrived there was no set up at the side of the building as there had been previously.  They did not  understand where to go since this was the first time my son had taken my husband. We had not ordered previous  to this since we  did not know. We had another pickup at WalMart the next hour and they did not have the time to go in and shop plus it would have been hard for my husband to do so. My son is taking my husband for the WalMart pick up and will bring my husband home and turn around and go back to Dothan to shop for us at the time he can go in.  That is 30 minutes each directions or a total of 2 hours driving to get our needs. Extra time, extra gas. extra money which doesn't make sense to me. I just talked to a lady and she informed me that they had told people for the last 2 weeks when they came. They did not tell us.

The glasses will be here next week. This does me no good. I am now in an emergency situation, as I cannot see, and have to go to work. A shoulder shrug, sorry was all I got. If a correct pick up time cannot be given, then why bother giving one at all?

We stopped using walmart 5 years ago because of their poor service and it seems the philosophy has moved to Sams. Today my wife was in line only to have the register closed when she was next in line after she had waited a while, she moved to another only to have it closed after she waited a while. The lady on both occasions did not  give a reason or even apologize for the inconvenience. She simply point to the self check out and said  feel free to check yourself out. Well to anyone that knows my wife she is quiet and never gets upset with anyone but me. She walked out and left over $500 of stuff in her buggie.

I can assure you that the owners do care about our customers. Each bottle is individually priced and if a price shows incorrect on the bottle, that price needs to be updated on the bottle.
