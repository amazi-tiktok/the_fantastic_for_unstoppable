My grandson graduated high school and was offered a full scholarship at Auburn University. As an average family we made the decision to rent my home and I would move in with my daughter and assist with getting him through college. So I packed up my most precious belongings and searched for a climate controlled unit for myself. The staff were most helpful and assisted me in getting an end unit so that I could get to my things easily if needed. Being a single woman and trusting your entire life being put into storage can be so stressful. However Ashley has been great, her kind words and helpful attitude have made me feel comfortable about leaving my life of independence and helping to write a new chapter in life for my grandson. I certainly hope that IStorage knows what a wonderful employee they have in Ashley. I would not hesitate to recommend this facility to anyone for their storage needs. I still have 2 more years to go before I can once again be independent and I can do that with no worries\nThank you so much Ashley !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286a6c9aad44f:0x78be7047b6726e8a"}

They wanted my car insurance, car registration, home owners insurance, etc to store items (car and household items).    .     Prices are also high. $25 paperwork fee. (or whatever you call it) and   $120 a month for a 10x20.\n\nI just called and \"covered storage\" for my boat is $137/month.    I can keep it in the local \"dry storage\" Marina where it's kept inside protected from freezing and put in the water any time I want for $130 per month, with full service.   You call their local phone number and it also goes to a corporate 800 number call desk. This place was a LOT cheaper before it became an \"iStorage\" franchise.

Our unit was located in an easy to get to spot, but so were all of the others I saw.  What I liked as well, was that there was a coke machine on the property.

We were moving items out of storage to go into a bigger office. I wasn't moving completely out, just moving a few items.

I'd attempted to introduce my office manager to her a few days before and she wasn't there. When I spoke with Brenda, she told me she needed to know what I was doing. I told her she did not because I wasn't completely moving out. I had problems with her last year.\n\nDo NOT rent from them! I'm actually moving from there because anyone who'd discuss, mention or otherwise engage in conversation about my bill to an unauthorized person is not to be trusted.\n\nI complained about this two days ago and no one has even followed up with me.

I think Brenda can be a much better face of the company if she watch her deliverance, mannerisms and tone when communicating with tenants.

While I am a college student I wanted a place to store my items to make my appartment a happy livable space. Today I went to store 8477 and met a very lovely associate named April Goodman and while  I was there she treated me not only as a customer, but it welt like during the our time felt like family. When I asked to see the 5' by 7' we looked at the unit and it was not something i was looking for. However when she suggested a 5' by 15' we needed to walk to the very far building on the property to view the unit. Ms. April recommended the golf cart. I told her we did not need to use it since it is a beautiful day out and it would be a nice walk to get exercise. As walking down I told her I might not like the 15' size and asked about the 5' by 8' and that it was the last one available and that we needed to walk back to the main building to see it. As we were walking to the last building she asked if I still wanted to see the 15 footer and I asked her please. When we walked back to the 5 by 8 room I walked in it and i felt in love with the space that it had its own light and also own air vent. I told her it was sold and we went back to the office and did all the paper work and I am now renting a air controlled 5' by 8' and so far I love it. As I was loading my unit an hour ago I loaded a car load in the unit then walked to the office to ask a question. As I opened the door to the office I was looking into the office smiling and as I was walking in Ms. April's office phone rang and Ms. Lechelle in the desk right next to her asked me how can i help you. As I was walking in I did not notice Ms. Lechelle asking me that question. So as I continued walking into the office Ms. Lechelle rudely asked me how may I help you. I asked my question and left the office not happy with the tone she was talking to me in as a paying customer. I do not appresiate that at all. Next time I go to the office to get help I will only make sure that I only ask miss april for help no matter if there are 2 people in the office or if she is off I will only work with her. Overall I love the facility and I would gladly recommend it to my friends and family if they ever need any storage rooms.

You can tell a lot about a place during the move-in and move-out processes. This place is the best. I also learned that the humidity in the Madison Alabama area is not good for cardboard boxes. Stacked cardboard boxes began to fail over time. I do recommend the tough storage tote bins from Home Depot. They hold up well and can be stacked to the ceiling. You can seal the tote bins with Ty-wraps and large moving companies will take them without an issue. The plastic tote bins also do well if it decides to rain on moving day like it did on mine. Of course, I always recommend being a good steward of the rental space keeping it clean and reporting any issues (none for me).

We were quoted a fair price for the storage unit. We were also told that if we presented proof of our homeowners insurance (which we did) that we would avoid paying their monthly warranty fee. Well, I was unable to pay my first bill online because their website wasn't cooperating. I called and had them email my account info to me again. Still didn't work. So I called and asked if I could pay over the phone without having to pay the customer service fee they usually assess for phone payments. The lady agreed, which was great, but guess what was also included on the bill...the warranty fee!  I really didn't notice until I received the invoice for the following month, and wouldn't you know it, there is that warranty fee again! So I called the iStorage location to get it cleared up. She removed the warranty fee from the upcoming bill, but refused to credit my account for the prior month's overpayment because I paid over the phone! The way I see it, that type of behavior is, at the very least, wildly unethical, and may even be criminal.\n\nEdit/Update: I just received a call from a nice lady from iStorage.

My husbands belongings from his divorce are in it and my mother in law has been paying it.  She is 83 years old and has had a stroke.  I have been paying her bills since August.  The guy there knows that i pay the bill.  I've never been called for a late bill and as I live in her house now to provide her care, i would know if she had been called. It's never been late.   Now they are calling and harrassing her for money because a LATE fee will be added on TOMORROW.  I tried to call Yesterday and NO ONE would answer.  I've paid it on the 5th of EVERY month since I've been paying the bills and I get a woman....(always been a very nice man in the past) who is a witch and says she is the manager.  I became angry with her and asked her what I needed to do to close agreement out as I was going to come get my things out of the unit.  She said my mother in law would have to come there to do it.  She KNOWS my mother in law is bed ridden and can't handle the account.  I even got my mother in olaw to tell her she could discuss the account with me...........she insists that SHE has to come by to sign off on the contract.  She advised my mother in law that she set her up on AUTO PAY.  I promise you I will have a new Debit card and I dare her to try to charge anything on this account.  They won't get one more dime out of me!!!\n\nSince I can't respond to the response I received on this.....I will say that My husband IS ON THE LEASE.  It is HIS belongings.  My mother in law just use to pay it.  And \"Witch\" was a nice way of saying so much more..........

If you can have Wanda add her daughter-in-law to the lease, then she can have control of the account. Since Wanda can't come down to the facility, she has the ability to add her daughter-in-law to the lease over the phone. If you have any other questions please give me a call at 805-570-5528.
