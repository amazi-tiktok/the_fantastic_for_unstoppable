Tech has been there for 33 years and makes 12/hour. They don't care not one single bit about your well being or anything except for running thier boards,and not spending money. The benefits are a complete joke,they lie about stuff in the interview process to just get people hired on. They don't drug test so there is alot of junkies and alcoholics working there. I wouldn't take back a job there if my life depended on it and I dang sure wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. I seriously don't see how they even keep thier doors open at all. Hopefully the right people see this and something gets done about how horrible this place is. I'm still considering calling OSHA about some issues as well along with workforce. This isn't a review based off of me just being upset. It's proven facts anyone working there can tell you.
