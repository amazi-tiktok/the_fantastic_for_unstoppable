The store is filled with interesting products from across the world. There is something here for everyone! The owners even showed me a few of their prized personal possessions which were kept in the back room, making me feel like V.I.P.  The store itself was well kept...which I can only imagine to be a constant struggle considering how many shelves and items must be dusted frequently to maintain the clean environment. Everything sparkles! If you have the chance, ask the owner about the musical vibrations produced by the bronze gong hanging behind the register -- it makes beautiful sounds which fill the space entirely, engulfing it's visitors in a sense of peace and tranquility. This store is just the kind of retail attraction our community needs in this area - Definitely recommend visiting A Coastal Zen as soon as possible!!! Bring more money than you think you will need because you will be surprised how many items will strike your fancy!
