You also have the option to \"upgrade\" your painting by purchasing a larger canvas.\nAnother thing that most of these places do is sell the paintings that the instructors do during every class. I wish I could say that they're affordable and worth the price, but that definitely is not the case. When I inquired about which paintings were for sale and about the general cost, the woman got snarky with me. After paying well over $100 to for little to no instruction and having an overall bland experience, I did not want to give this place any more of my money.\nPAINTER'S TIP:\nI would suggest stopping by Walmart (or ordering off Amazon) and getting a cheap variety pack of paintbrushes (I posted a photo of the pack I purchased).
