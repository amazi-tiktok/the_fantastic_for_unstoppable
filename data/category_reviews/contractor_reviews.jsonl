He responded quickly, after hours (at night on a weekend), and dina great job.\n\nToday we called on him again to install a garbage disposal in our kitchen and check a leak behind our master bathroom toilet. The disposal was easy, but the bathroom was a bit trickier since he didn't know what he would find behind the wall. He walked me through the steps he was taking and provided a price range based on what he might find once he got started which was helpful. (That way we knew what the high end might be if damage was extensive or the repair was more complex than anticipated.) Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as it could have been and itwas easily fixed in one visit.\n\nThe 9-1 team is on time, professional, and affordable. Doug and his team were also very clean while working on the repairs which was much appreciated.

Second spraying comes around and same thing- earwigs inside every day. This time when we contacted them (2 weeks ago), they ignored us. They also didn't call when they came to spray the second time so if hadn't been home, he wouldn't have been able to get inside or in the backyard. We signed a year contract and I'm not sure what it would take to get out of that. But signing a contract should have been a signal they were bad.

I live out of state, but used them for my second home in AL.  I specifically asked them from the beginning to put my primary out-of-state home address as the billing contact.  For years, they would conduct the service and send the bill to my primary address out of state.  I always immediately paid for their services via credit card over the phone.  For my annual ant and terminate inspections this year, I just happen to call them to schedule things, and they said, \"we closed your account because of failure to make a payment.\"  ???  I told them I never received a bill nor knew there was an outstanding balance.  I asked what the billing address was...never got a straight answer.  Eventually, the phone representative admitted to the possibility that Bama may have sent it to the AL home where the service was being performed.  Also not true, because my mom lives there and sends me all bills that come to the house.  The phone rep even had the nerve to say \"we were sending the account to collections.\"  I never even knew there was a bill due!  And they obviously make no attempts on their end to keep in touch with the customer.  That was issue No. 1.  Nonetheless, I immediately paid the outstanding balance and that issue was resolved, despite Bama's sloppiness and failure to communicate.\n\nIssue No 2., they have an absolutely unconscionable provision in their agreement that says something to the effect of, \"Customer must give 30 days written notice before getting out the the Agreement.\"  The very next sentence in the Agreement says, \"Bama may cancel the contact without notice at any time for any reason.\"  What?!\n\nBesides the fact that such a provision would never hold up in court if there ever were a dispute, it is a completely onerous clause.  They're not selling gold, they spraying chemicals on the ground, for goodness sake.  No need for such an unfair clause.  I asked the representative for a reason for such an unfair clause.  She responded something to the effect of, \"we need that in there for customers who don't pay.\"  What????  Well, in my opinion, such language is waaaay over broad for such a limited scenario as nonpayment.  Anyway, I refused to agree to it, Bama Exterminating refused to change or delete it, and we parted ways.  I signed up the same day with their competitor, who actually ended up being cheaper...and more organized as well.  I have been happy so far.\n\nThere is a fine line between a mom and pop operation and a sloppy operation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603267877fefd:0x2a05ac8851bf106c"}

In my case, they made several mistakes and refused to admit to or even rectify their own mistakes.  I purchased my home four years ago and it came with a termite bond with Bama Exterminating.  This year (2014) they mailed me a contract to sign regarding that termite bond with dates listed from 2012 to 2014.  In essence, because they made a mistake and did not have me sign a contract when I purchased the home, they were trying to get me to agree to terms for the previous years to cover themselves legally while disregarding the legal issues for the customer.\nI called their office manager, Kim Ousley, to inquire about this contract and she was unable to explain why I was receiving this contract four years after the home purchase and why the contract had a start date listed as 2012.  After getting frustrated with my questioning and being unable to answer the questions posed to her, she hung up the phone.\nThen, I spoke with another employee, Mr. Bridges, who did manage to explain at least why I was receiving this contract at the time I did.  However, he did not see any issue with me agreeing to terms, in writing, that were two years in the past.  He also did not see any issue with Ms. Ousley's behavior even though she was unable to explain their contract and hung up on a customer after getting flustered.\nSo, there are a serious of problems here that are all the mistake of Bama Exterminating and the company refused to rectify their mistake.  First, they should obtain a new contract when homes are sold for the new owner.  They failed to do that in my case.  When they realized their mistake (in 2012), they continued to let the contract go unsigned.  In 2014, they mailed a letter and a contract dated for 2012.  In the letter they stated they could not renew my termite bond UNLESS I signed the back-dated contract.  This seems reasonable except the mistake was on their end and I shouldn't be required to sign things I am uncomfortable signing and they refused to fix it.  I offered to sign a current contract but they would not do that unless I signed the back-dated one.  Finally, the way the office manager, Ms. Ousley, handled the call was unfortunate.  If she did not have the proper information or could not communicate effectively with the customer, she should have found someone else to help rather than hang up the phone on a long-term customer.\nIn sum, there were multiple errors made this company and even after I offered to sign a current contract, they refused to fix their mistake or even take responsibility.  I would not recommend doing business with this company until they refine their business practices.  There are many more companies that offer the same type of services and will offer better customer service.\n\n***Update - I hired their competitor for half the cost yearly and I would suggest doing that.  From what I have learned about pest control, Bama Exterminating is using older bait stations which is why they need to come service them four times a year.  Companies that use more modern equipment are lower cost because the stations need to be serviced less often.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603267877fefd:0x2a05ac8851bf106c"}

I informed Mr. Patel that I would be glad to provide him with a contractor that could do the prep work properly, he chose to use his own contractor.  Mr. Patel and I had several conversations leading up to the date of the installation about specifics of the job.  The statement that I never returned phone calls is patently false.  Mr. Patel has had several conversations with our office as well, to which his phone calls were always answered or returned (records to prove it).  Our office called to confirm the installation date on June 3rd, at which time Tina went over everything that needed to be moved again.  I spoke with Mr. Patel on Monday, June 7, TWO days prior to installation date of June 9. It was at this time I discovered Mr. Patel had been misinformed by his contractor about what needed and didn't need to be removed.  Aqua-Guard only removed Mr. Patel from the schedule when he wanted us to postpone his job.  In that conversation our office manager explained to him that if he postponed the job that we are booked out and couldn't guarantee when he could be worked back into the schedule.  He called us back on June 10 to get back on the schedule and we were unable to give him an immediate schedule date. We were in the process of shuffling our schedule to work him back in when Mr. Patel called our office today upset and cancelled the project all together.

They came out immediately to fix the issues and I wouldn't hesitate to hire them again if we ever need to.

We contacted AquaGuard to redirect one of the discharge lines and they quoted us a reasonable price, so we decided to have them do it. It took several calls to get them to come out, and they finally came out about 4 months later. The guys who did the work didn\u2019t cap the sewage line, so I called them and asked if they could come back as it should only take a few minutes. Well I wasn\u2019t surprised when they didn\u2019t so I just went to Home Depot and purchased what I needed. Overall, quality of work was good (besides not capping the sewage pipe back).\n1st Update: Went to the basement this morning to discover that the guys working had broken the drainage pipe for our bathroom sink and they used a Romex power wire we have running in the basement to hang their new pipe on.

Mike was very easy to work with and did a great job addressing all concerns. We had several companies come out and quote the job and as it so rarely turns out these guys had the lowest price as well as the most intelligent solution. One of the other companies wanted to sell us a similar system with an unnecessary pump system for almost twice the price of AG. Due to our property being on a heavy slope it made more sense to have the water gravity fed from the basement to have one less thing to worry about maintaining. Mike saw the reason in this approach and explained while some applications do require a pump ours did not and so was able to design the system to accommodate our individual situation as opposed to saying \u201cThis is our system. It\u2019s the same for everyone\u201d. On the day of the job the crew showed up on time with a supervisor to address any concerns before starting the job. Everything was completed and cleaned up in a matter of hours. They didn\u2019t leave a mess and did exactly what they said they would. Tough to find these days, especially at a reasonable price!!  I would highly recommend this company. Not only did they knock it out of the park installing a water proofing system that is working like a champ but also offer a warranty for the life of the structure which is as good or better than anything else I was able to find while researching how to solve the water issue.

The GOOD: The price was very competitive, Mike (owner) seemed very honest detailing the work to be performed, the crew completed the job quickly, and I haven\u2019t had any water intrusion issues since. THE BAD: following the completion of the job I noticed several items that looked suspect - caulking around door, window, fireplace, and at end of wall sheets was missing or poorly done, sump basin cover had a large cutout and therefore not well sealed, encapsulation in crawl space was made up of what looked like a lot of scrap peices haphazardly taped together and noticeable creases in the tape joints. I didn\u2019t call Mike to come back out because I figured they were the pros and the installation methods were acceptable and/or industry standard - i.e not items I should be concern about. Well... 2.5 yrs later, I\u2019m having issues with the tape joints separating and releasing moisture and foul odors from the soil gases escaping the encapsulation in my crawl space that are coming up into our main level. I contacted Aquaguard and was told that it\u2019s been too long since the install for them to correct the problem free of charge. the customer service representative basically stated that \u201cif the waterproofing system isn\u2019t leaking then it doesn\u2019t fall under their warranty.\u201d So much for standing behind your work. If the encapsulation membrane would have been taped correctly we would not be having this issue. Note* I have already addressed the poor caulking and sump basin lid on my own as to not be a \u201cneedy customer\u201d.\n\nInteresting bit of info... I called BDry about this as I thought they had done the waterproofing. They sent a rep out the next day, he checked the encapsulated crawl space, agreed it was not installed acceptably, and said they would be sending someone out to correct the problem before end of week. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve realized they didn\u2019t perform the work originally so I called them off.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889185828db1a29:0x9999084413a45e1d"}

The quality of work in areas of my complete remodel is pathetic. We had Clay do a complete remodel of a 1983 condo. He not only left us with work that needed to be redone but he did not pull permits with the city and cut corners to save on his cost. The paint and trim work is the most frustrating and disappointing of all. Areas of trim were left short in doorways and a single coat of watered down paint was \u201csplashed \u201c on the walls. I paid to have the walls textured and the visual inconsistency is disgusting. There are multiple areas where the paint is not complete and behind the toilet was left unpainted too. The 1980s faceplates were left on the outlets and painted around. The outside doors were changed out but not painted either. I guess the factory primer was good enough? Same for the crown molding...factory primer again. A water leak occurred from the painter not paying attention created damage to the unit below us as well.  We had him replace the old AC unit and duct work moved from the floors to the ceiling. The power cord supplying the AC wasn\u2019t replaced to meet code and I had to pay someone to fix the issue after the job was complete. Electrical outlets were left dead and the microwave was mounted flush under the cabinets preventing ventilation. The knobs to the faucet sink weren\u2019t even screwed on. I\u2019m out more money to fix what should have been taken care of by my contractor. I understand that projects don\u2019t always come out the way you want but the texture, trim and paint job done on this job is unacceptable by anyone\u2019s standards.

The first time it was to correct a foundation \"repair\" that was botched by another company who would not cover their work.  Kennedy and Sons excavated the old work and tied the piers and our foundation to deep rocks in the mountain, and that part of our house has been solid ever since.  Unfortunately, a different corner of our house needed repair a couple years later, and I called Kennedy and Sons again.  They put in push piers and again tied the foundation to deep rocks.  It remains to be seen how this new work will stand the test of time, but based on the prior work, I'm confident that it will.  The price on the work was very good, and they got to it quickly and were done within a week.  They didn't mess up my property.

Your correction should have included ALL THE REPAIRS TO CORRECT my flooring issues whether it what the builder did or did not do RIGHT?

The work involved Foundation Support Piers under brick footings to fix cracks in brick veneer and Stable Lift Piers with 2x8 girders in the crawlspace to fix sagging floors.\n\nTony was referred to me by my real estate agent and he was absolutely fantastic. Tony came right on time when he said he would be there and his communications were prompt and professional. It was a pleasure to work with Tony during the proposal phase and the work itself. He is technically knowledgeable and dependable. I highly recommend him! He is the reason I contracted with Don Kennedy & Sons.\n\nThe foundation support piers did exactly what they were supposed to do. The stair step cracks in the brick closed right up as we had hoped. There was a little more impact to the yard and soil than I had expected, but not a major issue.\n\nThe Stable Lift Piers and 2x8 girders also did their job. They are not as elaborate of a solution as the adjustable \u201cSmart Jacks\u201d on top of poured concrete pads from AFS, but they do work and they are a little less expensive. I recommend that consumers understand what they are purchasing on major repairs like this and get someone to help if they don\u2019t. I did an internship with a home inspector, and I have structural improvements at my main residence, so I was able to spot some minor issues which Tony readily and proactively agreed to correct once I explained them on the phone. The laborers came right over, understood my concerns, and fixed them right away. Some additional materials were added at no expense/no questions. I think if Tony had been available to inspect before I did he would have corrected these on his own. My own inspection was prematurely hurried by the office manager \u2013 see below.\n\nAdministratively this business has some improvements to make. At 2:00 on Friday I was called by the administrative assistant that my work was complete and asking for immediate payment. I kindly asked for a chance to see the work first over the weekend and that I would pay on my way to work first thing Monday morning. I was told that they would have to ask the office mgr. This made sense and I agreed. Surprisingly, Jordan called me back promptly explaining that this was not acceptable per her manager and that I needed to leave my own job and arrange for payment with Jordan ASAP. I immediately left a voice mail for Tony. Thankfully he straightened it all out. I was never given an apology by the office manager.\n\nSo, I ran over first thing Saturday morning to inspect and observed the minor corrections needed to be made. The office mgr\u2019s insistence on paying right after they were done Friday seemed underhanded (and downright strange too), but Tony made it all right. The office manager needs to get better at being reasonable conducting business, treating people respectfully, and resolving business issues firsthand with customers.

The laborers worked hard and were very friendly.\n\nI\u2019d recommend to Don Kennedy and to their customers that a 7-10 business day payment period be part of the contract to allow the customer time to inspect repairs, Tony to inspect, and/or get a buddy to inspect after completion of the work.

I\u2019ve contracted lots of work over the years and I\u2019ve never been pressed for payment so urgently \u2013 despite a 50% down payment before starting the work.\n\nIn summary I do recommend Don Kennedy & Sons for residential structural repairs and especially if you work with Tony.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626a2e738087eb:0x38d226941a1e4b83"}

I wanted to change my kitchen from oak to white which can be very tricky to do without looking tacky.  I found his website by doing a google search for refinishing kitchen cabinets.  Nick came over and gave me an estimate right away.  He has a very warm personality and is immediately likeable.  I knew after talking to him about his process and reviewing his photos on his website that I had found the right person to do the job.  He kept me in the loop through the whole thing.  He comes over when he says he will and calls beforehand, he finishes the job when he says he will.  He took my cabinet doors and drawer faces back to his shop and sprayed them there.  He came into my house and sprayed the actual cabinets and surrounds.  The whole process took under a week and I was amazed at how stunning the kitchen cabinets came out.  I can't stop looking at the kitchen without saying WOW!  His attention to detail and the quality and craftsmanship is beyond compare.

It took only 2 days for removal and installation of my new roof which is amazing because mine is very high pitch. Each day they cleaned up their debris (shingles, nails, etc..) and when the dumpster they used leaked hydraulic fluid onto my driveway, they pressure washed the spot. His crew even replaced a board on the side of my home that had a rotten spot. I cant tell you how pleased I am with the aesthetics of my new roof, not to mention how structurally sound it is. 2nd to None had the highest warranty (7 years) of all the companies I was considering which was also a deciding factor for me . Most only have a 5 years warranty and one had only 2 years. When a company can stand behind their workmanship, they deserve my business. Bryan also worked closely with me to make sure I had the right type of shingle (color, functionality). He also imparted valuable advice regarding which shingle manufactures are honoring their warranties. Also..it needs to be mentioned that before they installed the new roof, I had a portion of my old roof tarped but the wind blew it off. Of course heavy rains came and water was leaking in several spots on my roof and into my master bathroom/closet. It was raining and lightening when his crew got on my roof to retarp/stop the leakage. That was also a deciding point for me that I would be using his company for my new roof. I can tell you most companies would not have done that. Also Bryan worked diligently with my Allstate adjuster explaining the cost of the roof which they had initially underestimated. I highly recommend 2nd to None and I have been telling my coworkers/friends about his company as well.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618276998499, "text": "Thank you so much for your business and this wonderful review!!!\nBryan"}, "gmap_id": "0x886216427e162285:0x5bf81f36acf4143e"}

With genuine sincerity we would rate this company,  under the leadership of its owner, Mike Hayes, as \"Best in Class\". The group is made up of dedicated professionals and highly skilled individual driven by high quality service comittment.\nThe repair MDH was hired to do was one that had been previously attempted by another foundation repair company. This was our second time addressing the same problem. While the first company ensured us the fix we paid for was permanent. It was short number of years later that we began seeing signs indicating the repair was failing . We found ourselves back at square one.\nAt the time we did not know MDH Foundation. We did reach out to the only other company we knew of thru advertisement only, and while we had someone come out assess and quote us a price, we chose to hold off. Very impressive sales presentation they did but we were just not convinced on their proposed corrective plan.  Some time later we hear of MDH, and a lot of good things being said of the owner, Mike Hayes. Not only on their foundation repair work, but as a very highly respectable contractor too.  Earlier this year we met with a member of the MDH team, and an assessment was made. Then before the job plan was finalized, the owner, Mike, came out to thoroughly go over the plan. It was the first time we felt really comfortable about the corrective plan.  Mike has a great group of professionals and skill guys that communicate well together. They were very attentive to our concerns, explained and answered every question.  They were punctual and respective of time. Always leaving area neat after each day.

It took him about 11/2-2hrs to find the problem because I lost my common ground on one circuit in the house. He explained to me that it takes time to solve a problem of this nature. I thought he did it quickly considering the nature of the problem. He also replaced two wall switches and one wall plug. Jeramy and his partner were very friendly and professional and did not leave one stone unturned. It might have been a little pricy, but my lights work now and my flood lights outside are working and they haven\u2019t worked in a couple of months.

{"user_id": "115504932104850664042", "name": "David Solomon", "time": 1482943464951, "rating": 1.0, "text": "For this review, I feel I must first present a little information up front.\nFor the last several months I have been having issues with the plumbing in my house.  My house was built in 2007 with PVC pipe throughout.  Let\u2019s just first say that after purchasing the home I later believed the plumbing was not installed to code, and first experienced several water leaks of which I fixed myself.\n\nSeveral months ago I hired a plumber to come in and resolve a hot water (lack of) issue.  The Hot water tank had made an awful screeching noise similar to what I have been hearing in my modern GE Refrigerator with a water filter. At the time the plumber removed a check valve on the water Heater which resolved my Hot water problem and the screeching noise.  No further investigation was conducted on why the Hot water heater started having issues and I believe that repair cost me around $100.00.\nSo in the last couple of months I have still have that screeching with my Refrigerator and the pipes had been banging whenever we flushed one of the toilets.  Upon doing some research to try and resolve the banging pipe issues I had come across an article on a thermal expansion tank upstream from the Hot Water Heater on the Cold water line.  I located mine under the house just as the main cold water line comes in the house. The tank has a valve in it and is supposed to give a cushion for the water when it expands.  I went to check the expansion tank and when I put on an air tester, water came out, which is an indication of a faulty tank.  I purchased a new one and left the air pressure at the manufacture default and installed it.  Now my pipes started banging worse and the tank started making a sucking sound. I further researched the issue and found an article that too much water pressure can wreak havoc on your water system so I went to Lowe\u2019s and picked up a cheap home water pressure gauge. I tested my system and found that my home was averaging around 130PSI. Based on this information resources indicated that a faulty Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) just up from the home water meter could be the culprit. I located mine by digging about a foot up from the local water meter and left it uncovered.\nIt was finally time for me to call a plumber as I am not one, and only completed the previous steps out of necessity.  I am a retired Enlisted Veteran and have not had a real job for six years and have been struggling to pay my bills.\n\nThe day before Christmas I called B & C Plumbing Inc. and left message on their phone system that I would be needing their services when they could work me in.  Tuesday after Christmas I received a courteous phone call from the B& C customer service and scheduled a Master Plumber to arrive at my home between 14:00 \u2013 16:00. Shortly after that Drew the Master Plumber called me from his cell phone and said he was on his way over because he had a cancellation and would come and resolve the issue.\n\nThis is where the negative experience starts.  Drew arrived at my front door knowing the information that I had already shared previously and I shared that information with him again on what my issue was going on under the house.  His first statement to me before looking at anything was that it was going to cost me $300.00. No indication of a discount for anything or because I was a Military Vet.  Now first off, I expected that he would be crawling under my home and fix some of the issues with the bagging pipes (Non-Code meeting).  He had no time to give me a run down on what the problem was nor what it the cost layout was to fix my issues.\n\nHe proceeded to place a water pressure gauge on the outside faucet and recorded that the PSI was 145. He then went to the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) and replaced it spending less than two hours of actual time far less work as much of the time was him on the Cell phone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487948819020, "text": "Mr. Solomon, in response to your review I would like to apologize for your unsatisfactory experience with our company.

We called them for two weeks to get someone out to the house to look at a possible repair on our roof.  I was told that they would call me back. NEVER HAPPENED.  And it was right before Thanksgiving.  So I let that one go.  So I called back frist thing Monday morning and got a person that actually set up an appointment and they would be out to the house on Dec 1 after 3:00 pm.   We took off work to make sure that we would be there for the rep to  stop by.  IT NEVER HAPPENED. I called the office at 338-0490 and spoke to office person and she said that she would call this person to see where he was and call me back I told her I prefered to hold.  So she called and laid the phone done (no hold) and he said that the did not have a 40 ft ladder on him and he was in Odenville.  So she said that she would call another rep and call me back.  So Charles called and said that he would be out at the house Friday at 9:30 and take a look.  Well nobody was home and we had no clue if he had some out or not.  So I called Charles this morning and asked if he came out and looked at the roof.  He said the took a ride out and then said that they were covered up and could not get to my repair.

The project involved demo of some existing kitchen cabinets, replacement of a cook top and stove with a range, replacement of a vent hood, installing new kitchen lighting, laying tile, painting cabinets and bookshelves, painting trim, and painting walls.  All of this was handled by David's crew without having to sub out any work. The quality of the work done was really top-tier.  We used David's decorating consultant, Lindy, to help pick out colors, and the result has significantly brightened and beautified the two rooms where we spend most of our waking hours.\n\nWhen you undertake a project that takes this much time, you quickly realize that you have invited some strangers into your home for a lengthy stay.   Well, the guys David sent did not stay strangers for very long.  They were cheerful, friendly, and helpful to us.  They added, without cost, some features to the project at our request, even though these features were not in the original contract-- for example, installing a dimmer switch in the kitchen, replacing flood lights in our dinette area so they would match the color put out by our new kitchen lighting, cutting out the trim along one wall of our living room so our bookcase could lay flat against the wall, and installing wall outlets in our bookcase.  They cleaned up after themselves every day and hauled away their own trash.  When they moved furniture around to do some painting, they always put it back where it had been.  It got to where we enjoyed having the company at our house.  At the end of the job, we were glad it was completed, but we were sorry to see the guys leave.\n\nAll the work was done with great attention to detail.  They found and installed tile to match our existing kitchen backsplash tile.  They worked on our project every weekday for three weeks.  On some days, they worked on our cabinet doors and bookcase at their shop, but on the days when they did not come, David always called us to let us know they would not be there and what they would be doing that day.\n\nWe will certainly call on Lisenby Construction if we undertake new remodeling projects.

I just paid the funeral expenses for my father out of pocket.

They quoted me the price before even diagnosing the issue, stating, \"we can make this stop dripping for $175\". It was a 20 minute repair job and it did not solve the problem - still leaked. I requested them to come back because it wasn't fixed and all they did was the exact same repair. This did nothing, and the faucet still leaks to this day. The plumbers were not professional, did not wear masks, and did not want to take the time to accurately diagnose and fix the issue. Instead, they looked for the easiest and quickest \"fix\".  I ended up having to call another plumber who was able to correctly diagnose and explain the problem to me. I might as well have thrown $225 in the trash.\n\nNot only did the plumber waste my money, but cost me HUNDREDS. During my initial request for service, I also requested that they re-install a center knob on a shower spa sprayer that came loose. It was installed a few years ago, and nothing technically was wrong with it - the center knob just needed to be re-installed. After taking apart the cover plate and fooling with it, they said it couldn't be fixed. They never diagnosed the issue or told me what was wrong with it, offering no solution. I hired a different plumber to look at it today and he said that the metal lip on the center valve is chipped and broken from someone trying to turn it excessively to remove it (it is one piece and can't be removed). It was installed a few years ago, and no one else has fooled with it except for them. So, they chipped it when fooling with it, which explains their reluctance to fix the problem. Now the entire unit has to be replaced, I have to cut a hole in my wall, and it is going to cost me hundreds of dollars. An honest or reliable plumber would have owned up to the mistake instead of trying to brush it off, and a knowledgeable one would have known better to begin with.\n\nI honestly never leave bad reviews.

He arranged for one of his techs, Bobby, to make the trip to the house, and he followed up throughout the day to check the status and advise of how to deal with the gas company. On Christmas Eve, Bobby met the gas company for us to make sure the cut-on went smoothly. Keith again followed up to let us know.

I told him I couldn't afford that and he said \"well mam I can't help you with that. There's nothing else I can do for you then.\" I needed my ac running so I gathered up every cent I had and told him to go ahead with the repair. He then came in and told me that the thermostat wasn't telling the unit to kick on so we must have fried the new thermostat also. He left the base plate wired up and told me that it was wired correctly and I just needed to go get a new touchpad and it would work. He is a professional and I trusted his word so I paid him the $600 and he left without it working. It was late Saturday night so I ran and got the new one first thing Sunday morning. I put it on the wall and it would not work. I had to call another repairman to come out and fix it Sunday. There was nothing wrong with the 1st thermostat. The problem was that the Jolly technician wired it wrong. Now I question everything he did that night. I feel like I paid a lot of money for absolutely nothing.

Everyone knows foundation repairs are a big deal, so you want to get it right.  We were referred to AFS by multiple friends and we knew the reputation.  Yes there are cheaper options out there, but the foundation of my house just isn't where I want to pinch pennies, I need it right.  Jason our inspector was thorough and very helpful before, during and after.  Antonio, Rene, and Chase on the pier and encapsulation crew did a great job.  All the work done on time and cleaned up great.  Gavin and his helper were great on the poly crew that filled voids under slab.

We contacted a few different companies to provide an Inspection and estimate. After some discussion we decided\nOn a company that was not on the higher side of the estimates. We felt like the fix would be pretty much the same no matter who we chose\nAnd saving money was in our interest at the time..One company we called was a fairly well known local company A.F.S. We were familiar with them because they began here in Decatur\nSo we would see trucks around town. FYI,  I wanted you to know, we should\u2019ve called AFS from the start. Today I\u2019m here some 7 odd years later, after spending thousands of dollars with the low price alternative and my\nSump pump and drainage system doesn\u2019t work, our walls are blistering and cracking up, down and horizontally, water is seeping thru the wall cracks and the concrete blocks are shifting and cracking our exterior brick and interior block walls. I have limited mobility and couldn\u2019t go check on these things easily and things kept getting worse. Considering what we received from the lower priced company, we decided to call AFS to provide their opinion on our basement situation. At this point , the only thing working or effective was a dehumidifier. It was time to seek experts advice. We had previously used AFS in a limited capacity for our cracked pool deck and they performed that repair just fine and although that repair is not inexpensive,\nIt was much less and more quickly usable than any other options we looked at. So from there we felt we could allow them a chance to tell us (what )was happening and (why )was it happening . When the day came for the inspection, David Flamm , the inspector called our home in advance and let us know his arrival time and asked if we could sit for a few questions before beginning the inspection. He felt we would have something of value to help  determine the cause of the damage. We felt he was sincere and listened to what we had to say and even wrote down the answers. We watched as he went room to room with his big light and something like a laser . He was very thorough, and  took  pictures as he moved around the house.\nOne thing he did,  that most never do, is David removed his boots before walking on my clean floors. Not a big thing but it got my attention.\nAfter the inspection inside , he explained what he would be doing outside and that my husband\nWas welcome to tag along if he wanted, so he did. He was rather impressed with David\u2019s knowledge and ability to explain the plan of repair. After our experience with another company (who did almost nothing) and David\u2019s attitude and attention to our concerns, we were very relieved that we called AFS. He took pictures and put them on his laptop for us to clearly see the issues, he asked our opinion and waited for our response. Never did he act pushy or lacked any uncertainty about what he would do to help us. He allowed us to view video software of the repairs needed, and even priced the project as he went thru the videos. Needless to say,  we were very comfortable with Dave and could feel he really knew what the problems required. Before we had to ask, David explained AFS Warranty, Service and maintenance program and how they return and maintain the eguipment so we didn't have to worry. This was very helpful considering my physical limitations and my husband is very busy with work. We felt very reassured after spending a couple of hours with David Flamm, we had called the right company. AFS must invest a lot of time into the people that work for them, it was so smooth . We had no trouble connecting the dots. David explained the project review process they go they prior to arriving to our home and how the foreman on the job has already seen the project and all of the pictures as David and the foreman discuss the ins and outs of it. It seems every concern we had initially was addressed before we had to express it. AFS, should be the first and only call you make for your home today.\nWe are glad we did.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624291512896, "text": "Hello Betty!

They were very prompt and courteous.  We had a small problem that Nathan brought to my attention after he and his crew started the prep work in the area which resulted in them having to remove 2 additional (early 1930's) brick support columns and level the dirt foundation under them.  Had Nathan not brought the potential problem to my attention, even with the work they were doing, I might have had more collapse in that area in the future.  Now I won't have any concerns about that.  I was very impressed with how well these 3 men worked together and also independently while completing the job.  AFS has turned an old damp 1930's basement crawl space area into a bright, clean space my grandkids could play in at my house.  The crew cleanup in my yard was spot-on.  They even hauled off those brick columns for me.  I'm looking forward to the follow-up visit in about two months to see how much more lift they can get in my (had been) sagging floors.  There was some immediate improvement when they tightened all the floor jacks and after that new dehumidifier dries up my floor rafters for a few weeks we should see even more improvement.  No more squeaky, rattling floors!!\nThank you, AFS.\nPatricia", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1599576514922, "text": "Ms. Flory, wow, thank you for such a thorough and kind review!

It had to be stabilized or I was going to have to totally redo the carport.  I did not know who to contact but a friend had AFS do some foundation stabilization work for him. I asked him about AFS.  I had seen the TV ads but know that anyone can do a slick tv commercial.  It turns out, the friend was positively impressed with AFS on his project. So, I made an appointment for their rep to visit.  I was still a little skeptical.  The field rep arrived on time and looked at my issue.  He suggested their concrete stabilization product.  He described how it would work and be installed.  He was not at all pushy nor did he give me any slick sales pitch.  He knew about the product, how it was installed and what it could do.  I agreed to do the project with them and made a down payment on the project.  We scheduled the job and on the agreed upon day, the installation crew arrived.  They were a little later than initially planned BUT the office called to say they were running behind, so that was not an issue.  They were maybe 30 minutes later than planned. The installation guys checked over the carport and talked over their plans with me. Then they went straight to work. They were clean cut, totally nice people to have at my home with no smoking or foul language - just hard work! There was an obvious difference to the carport when they were through.  So, I really felt good about their work.  They also cleaned up any mess that they made (a little concrete dust) with the tools they brought to the job site. Prior to this experience, I did not know this company,  other than my from friends recommendation & a TV commercial.  After my experience I would not hesitate to recommend them.\nI give AFS an A+ & 5 stars!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601305643990, "text": "Mr. Counts, thank you for such a thorough review and recommendation!

Over the last 2 years, it has flooded during the heavy rains in January and February.  I did some research to evaluate this issue and decided to go with a reputable, established, and known company.  I was not disappointed.  Mr. David Flamm arrived at my house promptly for my initial appointment.  He was professional and personable.  After a few minutes of discussion, he understood my concerns and started his investigation.  Once he completed his investigation, he sat down my wife and I and went over his findings. His presentation of what could be done was easy to understand and follow along using the video clips on his computer. All seemed logical, but me, being the ever skeptic, asked many questions about how the system would work and why it seemed the water was infiltrating my living spaces after 7 years of no water. He answered all of my questions and his explanations made sense.  After it was all said and done, we had the Aquastop Control groundwater seepage system with Aquastop basement air system,  EZflow  tubing with the triple pump action installed.\nDay of installation:\nThe team showed up on time for the install lead by Nick.  It had been raining a lot AGAIN and i had my makeshift sump-pump system running to dewater the area where it was building up.  The team laid down plastic tarp so as to not get my finished basement dirty and commenced to working.  It took them 2 days to complete.  What a job. When they laid in the pump system and started the pumps, the water buildup that i had my makeshift system in for, drained and did not come back.  EUREKA!!  Since this system has been in place, we continue to get the storms and flooding but my basement/crawlspace remain dry.  The system works as described and projected.  I cannot thank Dave and his team from AFS enough.  Their professionalism and concern to provide a solution to my problem was genuine and their work is top of the line. Dave's evaluation of my needs and his concern to present me with different options was genuine and without company profit in mind. I highly recommend this company and team for any issues you may have in basement or crawlspace area.

Due to hydrostatic pressure my walls were caving in slightly. I don\u2019t remember the terminology  AFS uses but they came in and put what looks like a tarp over the walls.  It\u2019s to prevent moisture and mold buildup. Life time warranty. It might be working but since my walls are covered up I am only guessing it is. After I removed everything from the walls in the basement, yes, everything, including taking out my bathroom, they jackhammered around the edge of the walls about a one foot trench. AFS then put in place , what I call a gutter. Rocks were placed around this gutter along with a moisture barrier and then concrete poured on top. Supposedly, they put holes into each concrete block on my wall and place  a pipe that goes from block to gutter. As you know, these blocks have cylinders inside where water can build up. The purpose is for water to drain from block(my wall)into the gutter then it\u2019s to flow to corner of house where there is a sump pump.\n\nShort story is that it\u2019s been two years and no water has touched the sump pump. As you know the last two years have been like northwest Washington where we are getting tons of rain. Now I\u2019m having moisture, called efflorescence, coming up where they jackhammered. AFS came by several times and put a sealer on floor. Never worked. Had another man come by and look at system to see if water was flowing properly; it was. I spoke to one of the managers and he stated there was nothing else they could do.

We found this out after we notified them we had a quote from another company.  This should throw up major \u201cred flags\u201d to anyone reading this. Why not give you their best price up front? Now read the rest if you would like.\n\nStay away from AFS if you plan on getting multiple quotes.  I LOVED everything they told me and was completely impressed by their upfront professionalism.  The representative came out, did a thorough inspection and gave us a detailed layout of what needed to be done.  Where things went bad was when it was discovered that we also had another company come out, providing comparable services for a moderately better price.  As a decent human, I felt it important to contact the AFS rep to inform him of our appreciation but we were going to go with a competitor. At that point he became a high-pressured salesman and became somewhat belligerent.  To top things off, we had filed a coverable insurance claim regarding a busted drain pipe and the insurance company contacted this AFS rep and the rep told them the problem was due to an issue that is well-known not coverable by insurance.  Had I not called the rep to inform him, man-to-man, of our decision and simply \u201cghosted\u201d him (a cowardly way of handling things), we wouldn\u2019t be in the predicament.  Through this behavior and revengeful tactics, he reassured us that AFS is not the type of company we want to take care of our home.  My wife and I are teachers and work on a limited budget...we would be silly to not request more than one estimate for a job this size.  A company such as this should realize that.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578440362389, "text": "Mr. Milam,\n\nWe appreciate your kind remarks regarding the professionalism of our inspector.  We do try to be extremely detailed and responsible with both our inspections and repair plans.  Obviously we are disappointed when a homeowner chooses to use another company, but always want folks to make a decision that they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nIt sounds like there was some confusion regarding a possible insurance claim that you filed.  When asked by homeowners whether a crawlspace scenario is covered by insurance, our standard reply is that \u2018it depends on your policy, it\u2019s best to contract your insurance provider\u2019.  While we\u2019re not an insurance company, the trend that we have seen is that acute issues like a plumbing leak may be covered, whereas issues that develop over time, like ground water seepage are typically the homeowner\u2019s responsibility \u2013 similar to hail damage to a roof vs a roof just wearing out.\n\nThe inspection photos of your crawl space showed a pattern of mud lines on multiple walls of your crawlspace.  This is consistent with a ground water seepage challenge and why our repair plan called for drainage and a sump pump in your crawl space.  If asked what was found in our inspection, our policy is just to be candid.  We can\u2019t really speak to causality, but just to current conditions noted.\n\nHope this clears up any misunderstanding and we wish you the best with your repairs."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621663b63fdbf9:0xecb0ee1e38d7cfea"}

The first crew led by Luis G, working with Michael Moseley and Richard Warner installed the piers to stop the settling.  They did great work, never slowed down in spite of the rain that made a mess of everything, were always friendly and open to questions, and cleaned up the muddy mess better than I ever hoped for.  A great team of professionals.  The second team led by Gavin Dendy installed the SettleStop foam to raise the garage floor back up and stabilize it.  It was amazing to watch and they made it look effortless.  Gavin explained the process and made sure we understood and were satisfied before wrapping up and leaving.

When it rained the water would not drain properly in both of these locations.  AFS said that their injection program would fix both of these problems; in reality it was the start of making things much worse.  They drill a bunch of holes in the concrete and inject some material that is supposed to raise the concrete; unfortunately the whole concept is flawed.  They cannot control where this material goes as it is injected under the concrete and they are unable to correctly monitor the pressure as it goes in.  AS a result my walkway in back and my driveway ended up cracked and tilted in such a way that the problem was much worse; the water was now more directed towards my house.\nAFS tried to fix the driveway by cutting a 25 foot trench in my driveway and installing a drain; unfortunately this was also done incorrectly.  The slope of the drain did not allow the water to drain out, the drain was installed with large screws going into the drain pipe, which caught leaves creating a barrier.  Additionally, the cracks they created in the driveway and improper injection of the filler material caused my driveway to sag creating a lake that does not drain at all.\nAFS tried to fix the drainage problem made worse by their injection program in back by digging up part of the walkway and replacing the concrete; unfortunately, again they did not get it right.  They did not provide the proper slope to the new concrete and as a result the water make another lake immediately up against the side of my house.\nSo now I have worse drainage problems, my driveway looks like hell and as a result of the drainage problems the corner of my house at the garage is sagging.\nI would have been much better off if they had done nothing.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558126613083, "text": "Hello Mr. Ballard, we can certainly understand your frustrations.

He was excellent.  I was very impressed with Michael's knowledge and ability to make me understand what was going on with our home.  He showed me pictures and drew a diagram of what we needed for repair; he was very thorough.  He is a super nice person and is an amazing communicator.  Even after the fact, I called him, and he was very gracious, patient, and kind to walk me through activating my account with Greensky.

They DO NOT employ plumbers, carpenters or electricians to handle possible crawlspace issues.

In accordance with the contract I was responsible for making sure there was power available in the crawlspace for the dehumidifier. When I go into the crawlspace to take care of this I see a wet spot from 15 feet away and realize I have a water leak. A closer look revealed I had water damage.

Lance Archer at AFS, who has been in this business for a very long time and lives in the immediate area, was very helpful.  More than helpful, actually.

So it was decided I would have the work done.\nOn the two days the pier crew arrived, the crew chief Javier greeted me and we discussed the work progress and what they were doing each day.  Javier was ready to explain anything I was unsure about, with a short discussion on my expectations he and his crew was ready to get started. I have been around crews, and know how hard it is to get everyone going but without hesitation the crew was assigned work and they really got started. Along the way as I watched each of the crew was ready to explain what they were doing and why. It was great to see a crew that was self starting and knew their job so it could be accomplished with little delay. The second day the crew members changed a bit, but still  Javier was the crew chief, and again they started work soon after they arrived without delay and some conversations occurred at times to make sure what they were doing was the right way, because the situation of this repair was a little unusual, but they adapted to keep the work on time and with a professional attitude.\nThe third day the poly crew chief,  Dendy and crew arrived on time and immediately Dendy greeted me and explained what they were here for and ask to be shown the work area.  We discussed what he was going to do and how it would be accomplished and without delay, they got started preparing for the job of the day. They were always willing to explain the procedure and the expected results, and also how they would attempt to prevent any unwanted results.\nI want to commend all the personnel for their excellent work and their professionalism and accepting my sometimes unneeded suggestions and allowing me to express myself.\nThank you AFS for having happy crews, apparently they like working for AFS and proudly say so with a strong sense of belonging to a company who apparently cares about their employees.\n\nRobert Hendrix\nA  Satisfied Customer.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509053963738, "text": "Mr. Hendrix, we greatly appreciate your feedback, as well as your trust in AFS to complete your repair project!

After 20+ years and doing touch up painting as needed, we had to do more and that involved changing colors in about 70% of the house.\n\nWe did our due diligence and got three estimates from reputable painters.  The first came in roughly $4000 over our budget and we began to consider just painting the main level.  The second (who we had used in the past) was only $200 over budget, had done good work for us in the past and we were now in a comfortable price range.  The Painting Company was the last we called and came highly recommended by several friends and neighbors.\n\nWhen Peter and I completed our walk through, he handed me a nice glossy folder containing references, insurance information, standard practices and the like.  We had also discussed upgrading from a contractor grade paint to something better (especially since we are known to only paint when its an absolute necessity).  Peter was courteous and professional and as he drove off, I knew we could never afford what we had discussed.\n\nThe bid from the Painting Co came in the next day and was $1600 under budget ($1800 under the next closest bid and $5600 under the high bid).  I read through the detailed list of inclusions and exclusions, the color choices in the different rooms, the type and manufacturer of paint to be used and found it all to be exactly as discussed the day earlier.  We had found ourselves a painter.\n\nWe called and set up a date to start, game them a 25% deposit to cover material and began taking down pictures and putting away breakables.\n\nA little over a week later, two painters showed up at the house as scheduled.  They may have been 10 or 15 minutes late.  But, that was all.  The date was correct and they had all their gear and were ready to go.  We walked through the house marking which rooms were to be painted which colors to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding and they began moving furniture, taping the trim and covering everything (and I mean everything.  our house looked like a drop cloth bomb had exploded in it).\n\nThat day and part of the next were ceiling days and they began some of the upstairs walls.  The next day the upstairs was complete and they brought the show to the main level.  Three and a half days after beginning, they were cleaning up the house, we did a final walk through, some light touch up and they replaced the furniture before leaving.\n\nThey had estimated four to five days and finished in three and a half and the product was nothing short of excellent.  I was contacted promptly when they had the one question that required a minimal amount of homeowner guidance.\n\nIt's been a week now and every time we walk into a room we are still amazed by the quality of work and the difference that it makes.  I guess it's time to start planning the painting of the outside again.  The Painting Company will get the job.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620411002108, "text": "Thank you so much for the incredibly detailed 5-Star Review, Jimmy!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88893d2530b97bb5:0x3d2e1ac8c6984d89"}
