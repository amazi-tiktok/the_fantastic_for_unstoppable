I have had Beltone hearing aids before and got this upgrade.  The personnel at the Cullman office were super.  They were always attentive to my questions, friendly and pleasant and full of knowledge.  The hearing aid that was suggested for my problem has been wonderful.  It is clearer that any aid I have had before and I can now hear more clearly that in years.  I also got the remote control, which is the best thing since sliced bread.  The program that reduces background noise is my favorite.  When we go to a restaurant, I simply click to that program and I can hear those at my table clearly and not be distracted by the noise in the restaurant.  I have used this program at other places also, but it is most noticeable in restaurants. (Maybe it is because we eat out a lot)  I would highly recommend this hearing aid and the Cullman outlet for anyone that needs a hearing aid.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cb86831f2ef5:0xf0782039ba315f7f"}
