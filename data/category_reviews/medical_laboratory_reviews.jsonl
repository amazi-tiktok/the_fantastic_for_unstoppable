This business doesn\u2019t take appointments for some reason (because they\u2019re stuck in a 1900\u2019s complacency mentality). Thereafter, I walked into the waiting room and there were only 3 visitors in total (including myself). No surprise there, given the fact that this place is a nightmare. I was rudely informed that I needed to fill out administrative work regarding my visit, and I asked if they already had my file (since I have been here before). They continued to explain that my file was old (it wasn\u2019t) and I needed to update information (not true). Around 1 hour later I was informed that INFORMATION was finalized. At this point, I was the only patient waiting for treatment. After a few more minutes of waiting I was finally called into the Patient\u2019s Entrance. Wow, the holy grail of treating a cold/sinus infection has finally gotten prepared to tell me I need a Z-pack. The doctor proceeded to ask me the same 4 questions 3 separate times.
