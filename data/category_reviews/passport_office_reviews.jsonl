Their mailman Bryan put down that he delivered two of our packages in a mailbox (which we do not have a mailbox) and then tries to say that he delivered it to someone at our kiosk. I've spoke to every employee and no one has received either package! Our customers are steaming mad Bc their products have not come in so I called the office and spoke to a woman named Cindy I believe which was very rude and said that she talked to a female that said she claimed that she received the part and that she thought she had misplaced it. Funny thing is is I am the only female working here and I received no calls. I asked Cindy who this persons name was and she couldn't remember apparently. She also said that Bryan said he may have dropped it off at the store beside us that he couldn't remember. I've spoke to the owner the manager and the employees and they all said that they never received our package and that none of them have received a phone call from her. I figured it may have been the mall manager so I called her, nope not her either. I asked for some kind of proof that it was delivered and they could not give me any form of proof, I asked why he documented that it was delivered to a mailbox and he was saying he delivered it to us (why is the documentation off u know) and she said oh well they sometimes accidentally push the wrong button and file it wrong. So on top of them losing two of our packages and lying to us and having false documentation they are now saying that they are not gonna reimburse us for any of our packages they have lost. And because we now have to order another product AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME we will now be losing money from our business, the customers are steaming mad, and they have made business very difficult and we no longer trust them.

My mail is left with my neighbors mail in their boxes at times. Not always, mind you, just sometimes. And Why is it that our carrier will leave 2 out of 3 packages stuffed inside our jumbo box, and take the 3rd back with him causing Amazon to notify me that the carrier COULD NOT MAKE IT TO MY DOOR to leave my package and that I must contact the carrier to track it down?? My front door is about a hundred or so yards from my  mailbox & the carrier has left packages at my front door before numerous times. However,  yesterday he could not. I called the Post Office, spoke with the supervisor on June 11, 2019, tried to find out where my package was like Amazon told me to do, and  after a brief hold was told shortly & quickly the carrier will bring my package out today and the call was disconnected. How rude.  Why was it not left yesterday with the other two packages that WERE delivered?? Were there dragons in my driveway he just could not overcome??  And for over a month now, for some reason when the carrier tries to leave my mail the door on my mailbox decides to attack and tears itself from the box and flings itself into the ditch. My husband has tried to force it to stay by installing new rivets to hold the door on the box on (2) two separate occasions. We have finally stepped up to using bolts to fasten the door to the box. We sincerely hope this will stop our wayward mailbox from acting so rudely to our mail carrier. Hopefully this will help encourage our carrier to know we care about our mail and packages and appreciate him doing the same. He can leave our packages at our door anytime. \ud83d\ude0a", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a58724b29e4b7:0xebdeace4798d816b"}

It happens a lot in the past year.\n\n------------------\nEnd of new review\n------------------\n\nI have read several reviews from this place, and people have rated it low. I've seen the volume they do in this post office, and I'm surprised at how patient they can actually be with the amount of people that come through. The building and the property leave a few things to be desired, but for the most part, everybody here is nice and friendly and they do try to help you to the best of their ability!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_UBLlaNeQOJXrW2MHwwIgapcjvJ2vk0FlEpea=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d774e72a2f:0xd2712a0f5729d160"}

As someone who uses the post office a lot I know that the Gulf Shores office is one of the better offices around. They have a high volume of customers and mail. Prices are set by congess. Tax dollars are not used, the post office funds itself. Put yourself in the employees shoes dealing with customers that have messed up addresses or came to complain to them and they had nothing to do with that situation, but they listen and try and help. I know I would be a little frustrated sometimes too. Just a thought. Maybe it will make the experience better if you don't come in blaming everyone and just ask for help instead. Most of the negative comments i have read on here are just people whining because they didn't get exactly what they wanted and chances are they didn't pay to get it either. The post office has premium services for just about everything from special handling to restricted. You just have to be willing to pay for the service or properly wrap the items.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d774e72a2f:0xd2712a0f5729d160"}

Will not hand out General delivery mail except on Thursday and Friday between the hours of 2pm till 4pm. Called and talked to Postmaster and he stated that they would rather have you rent a P.O. box instead of using General Delivery. They would rather make the money off of P.O. box instead of the inconvenience of general delivery. Now I understand why the post office is going under. Lack of customer service. I explained to the post master it might be a good idea to post the general delivery rules somewhere so people will know. It sounded like he didn't care. Will be using UPS stores in the future.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d774e72a2f:0xd2712a0f5729d160"}
