I had a horrible cough during that and developed a hard pressure in the upper center part of my stomach which is pushing on my ribs and heart (possibly vagus nerve) I explained all of this to the doctor that I seen and told him I was having problems breathing since it started, much worse when I sat down. I also explained to this doctor that I had been taking meds for migraines but had ran out and needed a refill. Once this doctor found out I was a smoker, he seemed to not even care at all. He blamed everything on smoking. I had my 12 year old son in the room at the time and this doctor literally drew a graph of how long I was going to live on the bed paper. He terrified my son!!! I knew then I'd never see that man again! Instead of checking to see what the pressure was and instead of refilling a med I had been taking for 12 years he put me on Buspar. The first night I took that Buspar the pressure increased so bad I could hardly move! I'm also now having to take bp meds since all of this. I'm 34 years old, I should not have all of this going on and for it to hit like it did all at once. And instead of this doctor trying to help me he terrified my son! He also prescribed me Naproxen which luckily I didn't take because I went to St. Vincent where they done at egd and found I have chronic gastritis as well as reflux esophagitis so the Naproxen could have caused a stomach bleed... I've seen another doctor here who is better than the first but I am still having the same issues. I'm honestly believing a stuck hiatal hernia or something else has been missed. The new doc put me on zantac which didn't help either. I feel no better, in fact I feel worse than when I did when I went to try and get help here about 5 months ago. As far as the staff, nurses and other docs they are great. The first doc I saw I would not recommend to my worst enemy!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1628537207737, "text": "Hello Brandy.

He is personable, doesn't forget what is going on with you. He explains all procedures in detail with words and explanations that you understand.\nWith having 3 back surgeries before i was referred by Dr. Lawler from Oxford Alabama. My back kept becoming worse and the pain got to the point I couldnt take it anymore after hurting for about 6 years. Dr. Heck told me that he could help me but i had to have a long and extensive back surgery that was about 5 to 6 hours long. I was ready for anything and I left his office that day confident he would help me.\nDr. Heck came out 3 times during the surgery to speak to my husband to let him know how I was doing, and where he was in the surgery. That meant so much to my husband and me that he had that much consideration not to leave my husband wondering what was going on.\nI came out of surgery that day PAINFREE, after 6 years of constant hurting.  I was Up walking around the hospital floor on the second day feeling like wonder woman, I went home on the 3rd day. I can also walk straight and stand straight. That was a bonus that I didn't know that could be fixed.\nEveryone from the nurse care in recovery, the nurses there on the floor that took the most gentle and sweet care of me. The sweet people that brought your food, the folks that came to your room to get your food order, to the sweet sweet girls that cleaned my room were a joy to be around. GREAT HOSPITAL!!\nBoth of Dr Heck's office staff are great and attentive.  They Call You Right Back, friendly, and they get you right in to see him.\nI can't say enough great things about Dr. Heck and his staff.  Go see him and get your hurting fixed by a Great Doctor!!!

At the same time, we loathe waiting too, and we are focused on reducing the \"however long it takes\" part of visits, WITHOUT sacrificing the quality and detail of service - because quality MUST come before efficiency.

We share your feelings about the labs.  Just to clarify, in most cases, as in your case, we review our patient's lab results as quickly as we can, almost always within a couple of days of our receipt of the data.  Then, if the patient requests that we we do so (and not every patient desires that we do), we will share the results on the portal, where they can be seen by the patient directly.  Exactly how the results are displayed on the portal, however, depends upon how the lab sends us the results.  If the lab provides results to us in a structured, computer-friendly format (which we prefer), they will appear in the \"lab\" section; on the other hand, if we receive them via fax, we will forward those pages to the patient in PDF format, which can be viewed on the portal as well, in the \"messages\" section.  We agree it would be much better if every lab provided their results in structured format, but not all lab vendors are doing that just yet.  We are working hard with our lab vendors to make that a reality, and have been for some time.  We expect that in the very near future, virtually all of our patients' results, including labs drawn here at the office, will be received in a structured way (and, in turn, passed along to the patient that way).  We would like to make things as easy and intuitive as possible, and we agree that would help.

In each of two visits a piece we have waited for over an hour before even seeing him. My husband left a msg for him and he, nor a nurse never returned the call.

We understand the frustration of waiting for someone.  Suffice it to say that this spring and summer have certainly been trying seasons for us all, in healthcare and in other areas of life, and our continuing efforts to perfect the patient experience haven't yet consistently manifested in shorter wait times for patients.  Some day soon, they will.  We give each of our patients all of the time they need, and we can only hope that you and your husband have felt that.  We strive to get the right care to the right patient at the right time, and for that reason we have two other providers in our practice at present, an NP and a PA.  They are both quite skilled at treating complex patients, but they naturally tend to see patients for visits that are less complex on average than those handled exclusively by the doctor, and so for some patients there are many times that they may offer a more efficient healthcare encounter.  Consider visiting one of them in the future, and we believe you will find it to be a pleasant experience that you may even prefer.  Every patient will be seen by the doctor periodically as well, and the doctor is always available when necessary.  With respect to the question regarding a return call, we wouldn't want to discuss the specifics of a particular patient's situation in a public forum; however, if there were an urgent matter, we would ask that in the regrettable event that you don't hear back from us promptly, that you simply reach out to us again to check on the status of the issue and to reiterate the urgency of the matter; if there were to be a medical emergency, we would recommend that you seek care at a hospital emergency department and call an ambulance if necessary.  We thank you for giving us the opportunity to care for you and your husband, and we hope to see you again soon."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621310f9455325:0x5c077b603254c00e"}

We believe you bring up an important point that we would like to highlight.  It\u2019s true that patients sometimes have a wait to see their doctor or practitioner, and we take no pleasure in it when a patient is upset.  We would respectfully disagree, though, that this is due to a lack of regard for our patients\u2019 time.  In fact, we see it as quite the opposite.  We take our time with our patients.  Most patients have many questions, each of which deserves respect, and we strive to consider each one thoroughly at the time it is asked, rather than asking the patient to arbitrarily pick just one or two and return for yet another appointment at another time to handle the rest, which would delay care for weeks or months and require another trip to the office (and possibly another copayment).  We document the decisions we make together in a thoroughly detailed manner, often in the presence of the patient, which takes some time but improves the quality of care and communication.  We also care for our own patients in the hospital, which makes care in the hospital more safe, comfortable, and efficient. (This also means that the first patient in the office on a given day is probably not the first patient of the day overall.)  Whenever possible, we address routine screening and wellness concerns at each visit, so the patient does not have to wait until the annual \u201cwellness\u201d or \u201cphysical\u201d visit to receive that care; whenever appropriate, depending on the medical situation, we may perform that service on the same day as a visit for specific medical problems, to save the patient some time; the total cost to the patient is the same, and in some cases the total reimbursement to the practice is less, but most importantly the patient doesn\u2019t have to make an extra trip to the office.  We acknowledge that life is full of trade-offs, and some of the ones we choose to make at our practice have occasionally resulted in wait times longer than we would like.  We are continuously working to improve that, and we are absolutely confident that we will as our systems and workflows improve, but the truth is that the vast majority of our patients believe that it has been worth it, and we would agree with them.  We have tremendous respect for our patients, their time, and their concerns, and we are proud to provide medical care in a way that we are confident reflects that respect - even if it\u2019s necessary to wait at times to experience it.  We consider it a privilege to care for you as our patient and hope to see you again soon."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621310f9455325:0x5c077b603254c00e"}

During this visit she told him of problems she was having and he prescribed medicine and told her of some labs he wanted her to take. We called our insurance and verified these labs were ok. Later after the labs we get a bill for $550. Two labs on this bill that were not covered were never discussed with my wife and she did not know she was having them done. I called the dr. Office and his nurse said the dr. Added these labs and she said they have been having problems with insurance companies not covering them. I asked her why the dr. Did not discuss this with my wife first and the only thing she told me was that the cdc recommends them. Well the CDC is not my insurance company. I called my insurance and asked what was the problem. They told me that the dr sent them the wrong codes. That he sent routine codes instead of diagnostic codes. They called him and asked for the diagnostic codes and he refused to give them the codes saying there were no other codes that can be given. Well I think the insurance company would know if there were no other codes or not. Anyway I called the dr. And asked them why would they knowingly have my wife take labs, they did not discuss with her first, knowing our insurance probably would not pay for if it is only routine and not for a diagnostic purpose. I still have no answer and a big bill for something my wife neither needed or was told he was doing.I DONT TRUST THESE PEOPLE, I CANNOT TRUST dR. gREEN TO DO WHAT IS MEDICALLY AND MORALLY BEST FOR ME AND WIFE.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594449061360, "text": "Sir, We are sorry that you are so upset. We are generally meticulous about discussing each diagnostic test that we order with each patient, and the reason for doing so. That's important, in part, for this very reason - we can never know with complete certainty what an insurance company may or may not cover. And, of course, our medical decisions are made, first and foremost, with the good of the patient in mind; whether the insurance company decides to cover them, while important, is a secondary consideration. Medical decisions are made between the patient and the doctor, and no one should come in between that sacred bond. There are various different reasons that a test might be felt to be indicated - sometimes to evaluate an active problem, and other times to screen for a potential problem - and the tests and treatments we select are generally chosen according to scientific evidence and/or according to the clinical guidelines that define the standard of medical care in our country. The \"codes\" are used to communicate the reasons for tests to the insurance company; sometimes there is more than one code that could be used for a given test for a given patient (because there may be several reasons a test is ordered at a certain point in time), and other times there is really only one code that is appropriate. Some tests the insurance company may decide that they will never cover, and others they may cover only for certain reasons (which can change without notice). If they choose not to cover a test, it's usually not so much because the \"wrong\" code was sent, but rather because they have chosen not to cover that test for the reason it was ordered. If we can ever provide them other reasons, or codes, that weren't submitted at first because the first set of reasons sent seemed to the doctor to be an adequate explanation, then we will send those additional codes. But sometimes, all of the reasons we supply just aren't enough to get the insurance company to cover the test. Sometimes there are other codes that might get them to cover the test, but these aren't really the \"right\" codes unless they actually apply to the reasons the test was ordered for that patient at that time. We understand you are upset, and we understand why. But we would respectfully suggest that your concerns about lack of coverage are better directed to your medical insurance plan, which may have a different idea of \"medical necessity\" than your doctor, and we would further respectfully suggest that you consider that your doctor is the one that defines medical necessity, and that while the doctor has nothing to gain from ordering more tests, the insurance company could potentially have something to gain from declining to pay for some tests. We stand behind the reasons we order all of the tests we order, and the reasons are quite thoroughly documented in each patient's medical record, and we refuse to let another entity dictate to us what is appropriate for our patients.  We strive to review all the tests ordered and their reasons, but there is a lot that goes on during medical appointments, particularly ones that are conducted in-depth as ours are, and while we also work to ensure that the patient understands very well the plan of care, it's quite a lot to ask the patient to also remember every last test ordered and the exact reason why. While it would be great if the patient could remember all of that, that's really more the job of the doctor to take care of that in the medical record. If we failed to mention a test and the reason for it, we certainly wish to apologize. We would just ask you to consider the possibility that all of the tests ordered may have been discussed with your wife, and perhaps she was understandably more focused on the problem that was bothering her than on all of the screening tests that were also being ordered as part of a comprehensive visit. We consider it a privilege to care for our patients and will do whatever we can to be of service."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621310f9455325:0x5c077b603254c00e"}

I tried our primary care provider first who didn\u2019t have any openings that afternoon and upon their referral I called Urgent Care for Children on 280.  I was informed I could be a walk in our schedule an appointment time online so I opted to schedule a time because general that means you don\u2019t have to wait as long.  I arrived for my daughter\u2019s appointment early to complete any necessary paperwork since we\u2019d not been there before.  I signed in told reception we had an appointment he looked and confirmed but then said this: \u201cI know you have an appointment but....\u201d. Wait what?  Why would you say that to a mom, who took the time to fill the forms in online and make an appointment?  \u201cI know you have an appointment but\u201d there is a walk in, \ud83e\udd14 yes there is but I made an appointment for which I showed up on time.  So NO, it is not acceptable to say this to a mom and who has a kid with fever in your waiting room with who know what the others in the waiting room have.  We are in the middle of flu season and multiple other viruses and I made an appointment and those with an appointment come first especially when I walked in at the same time as said \u201cwalk-ins\u201d.  Needless to say he was not apologetic for dismissing the fact I called ahead and made an appointment and came at that time.  And for that I would give 1 \u2b50\ufe0f, the nurse and Nurse practitioner were what drove the rating up.  They were pleasant and helpful, my daughter thankfully only had a virus so we didn\u2019t end up with meds and thankfully nothing else she may have been exposed to by not being taken back when she should have been.  But that\u2019s my rating for all it\u2019s worth.

It was so wonderful to find an urgent care facility that is strictly for children! Many ER\u2019s are ill equipped to deal with children so it was so reassuring to know we\u2019d be seeing a Dr whose primary focus was pediatrics. The waiting room was very clean & colorful, it had two big screen TVs with children\u2019s programs playing, smaller tables and chairs for the children, and well lit with large windows. The receptionist was extremely helpful and kind (which is rare these days) and answered each and every question I had enthusiastically,and not as though I was an intrusion on her time. She offered a pack of goldfish crackers and Gatorade to my grandson & I noticed many other varieties of snacks and even pedia-Light that was available for the waiting patients. Including check in, paperwork, & waiting to be seen we sat maybe 15 minutes total. An added plus was they informed us that my grandsons records for his visit that day would be faxed to his regular pediatrician in our hometown so they\u2019d be aware of his visit. The nurse who called us back and took vitals was very kind and gentle and listened to all our concerns without interrupting. The physician we saw was very informative and thorough and answered each and every question slowly and completely. They have a lab on site so we were able to confirm, during our visit, that he had the flu. It was very nice that all paperwork and co-pays were done beforehand so we could leave immediately following the examination.

Upon arrival there was no one at the front desk. I had to ring the bell and wait several minutes until I actually saw a worker. Once a worker finally appeared she asked us to sign in and have a sit. She came back and got us checked in. We waited to be called back. Once we were  called back we sat in the exam room for over an hour. No one ever came back to check on us. I stuck my head out the door to see the nurse/front desk receptionist had left to get what look like a prescription & was just returning. She told us the physician would be in shortly, but that never happened. We ended up leaving without being seen. Common courtesy is everything. If a patient has been waiting for awhile it doesn't hurt to check in on them from time time.
