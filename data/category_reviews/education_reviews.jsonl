However, my name  was used by samuel and his family to arrange a marriage for his nephews legalization. I was blown away by such accusations that I called samuel to get to the bottom of it. Instead of samuel admitting to him using my name in an illegal manner, he used vulgar language and hung up on me. He then calls my dad to \"get control of me\" for standing up for myself. That's what he trains ppl to do, stand up for themselves, show respect, and be our best. With this being something he trained on, I thought he could have a mature conversation. I also expected an apology. I've never met anyone in Samuel's family so I knew that the information was coming from him. Samuel calls my dad, who has tried with him for years, and tells him he cant go to the gym anymore bc of me calling samuel out for illegal accusations. My dad remodeled Samuel's old gym and did a ton of work in the new gym for a lifetime membership. Now that membership is gone along with all respect I had for samuel. He later admitted to my brother that he and his wife did in fact discuss my name in this manner. He has not called to apologize but he has made threats to my dad bc all he cares about is his reputation. I just so happen to care about my reputation and my family also. I want everyone to be careful around this man bc hes not who he claims to be. I'm not saying he isnt a good trainer but there's more  to being a leader than training physically. Women need to be careful especially bc I'd never want them to convince someone to do anything illegal. The last thing samuel said is he was getting a lawyer so I got me a lawyer and all the proof anyone needs to know the truth. He thought an apology was too much to ask for. I never did anything to deserve this.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc7f7d5abef:0x8d8f937fcc70ba15"}
