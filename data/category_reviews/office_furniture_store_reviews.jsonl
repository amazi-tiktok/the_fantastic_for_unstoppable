When I came to the store, unannounced, he took his time with my husband and I, showing us what we told him we were interested in finding for our new home. I never felt pressured. I ended up buying a sectional and 4 barstools from him and he surprised me by delivering the stools a day early, with fabric samples for outdoor furniture I was wanting to purchase, but thought I would have to make the hour drive over and back to look at samples. He sent the ones I mentioned to him in an email with the delivery men so I could match them to my current color scheme and  then call and order it over the phone. They have given me exemplary customer service, the best prices of anyone I have shopped with and have earned my business for all the other needs I have for this retirement home. My daughter was the one who referred me to them, having received the same treatment when she purchased a new sofa for her home. They are the best!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8887d65298336cff:0xfe363943e2971bdd"}

If we didn\u2019t call the day before, they would\u2019ve done it.\n2nd...the delivery was not on time and the decided to send ya a loaner mattess but instructed us to not remove the plastic and expect us to sleep on crunching plastic for 2-3 days. NOT ACCEPTABLE! 3rd....They delivered my furniture late and it was not installed and setup properly.\n\nTheir solution was a HUGE insult!!! $99 credit!!\n\nWhen we called to discuss with manager, he kept passing comments and words through a sales rep and not wanting to come to phone to talk with an upset customer.\n\nAdditionally, we were told we should receive a call in a couple days from a manager that never occurred. After 3 days, we contacted corporate with same results. They told us that they will forward to a district manager and they will call us in a couple days.\n\nThis place is HORRIBLE!!!
