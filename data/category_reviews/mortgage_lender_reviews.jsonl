However, in short, if you value your time and sanity, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GET A MORTGAGE FROM INTERLINC.\n\nOur loan officer was Jerry Brown, referred to us by our realtor.  Jerry believes that he is an excellent communicator, which could not be further from the truth.  Additionally, he has no interest in listening to his customers -- when he interrupted me on the phone (which was a frequent occurrence) and I interrupted back to say, politely but firmly, \"Jerry, do not interrupt me,\" he immediately HUNG UP THE PHONE on me.  He then emailed me to say that he \"would not allow\" me to speak to him like that and that all further business would need to be conducted via email.  This, because I spoke up to tell him that I was not finished speaking and wanted my concerns heard before he blew them off again.  There is truly no excuse for hanging up on a customer, in my book.\n\nWhen the time came to transfer us to a closing officer, Jerry did not introduce us, tell us what was happening, or in any way orient us to the situation -- which, again, was typical for our experience.  Once the closing officer took over, Jerry just stopped answering emails.  At no point did we really have any idea what was going on, what was next, and where we were in the process.  To be told that \"your approval is on my desk\" and then asked for more documents and verification does not make sense.  Either we are approved, so we are done, or we are not, and further information is needed.  Once again, Jerry showed no interest in listening to my concern and confusion as to where we were in the process.\n\nIssues with Jerry aside, the fact that we were doing a \"mail away\" closing -- since we obviously could not travel 900 miles just to sign some documents -- seemed to present a major problem for Interlinc.  We were not informed as to the timing of the process, and though everyone involved knew when we were signing the GIANT stack of documents, it was only almost a week after the closing that we were informed that, due to federal regulations, we would have to re-sign the ENTIRE PACKAGE (some 92 pages) with a new date.  Once again, communication among various Interlinc employees was atrocious, as we were essentially bounced around like a hot potato, never knowing who was supposed to be organizing things for us.\n\nIn fact, our experience was so poor that I emailed a complaint to, among others, the CEO, requesting a refund of some of the absolutely ridiculous fees (1% origination fee, plus another $1,000+ in additional garbage).  An attorney for Interlinc contacted us, investigated the situation (whatever that means), and promptly issued us a check for the amount we requested.  The fact that we received that refund tells me that they know how badly they screwed up...and yet, we then had to deal with the date issue I mentioned above, with more of the same bad communication.  Clearly, they did not actually LEARN from their mistakes with us.\n\nSo if you want to, like me, suffer physical anxiety at every email and phone call, worry about approval on a \"slam dunk mortgage,\" and generally undergo a severe amount of stress because, for instance, you keep thinking your mortgage is DONE, and aren't you just wrong as heck, please, get a mortgage from Interlinc.  Otherwise, take my advice and stay as far away as possible from this company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aad3ea036f:0x699712e10636db4c"}

My real estate agent recommended Josh Winn to me, and I am extremely thankful they did. Just the first phone call with him, and I felt so much more confident in my home buying process. He broke everything down , and explained everything very clearly. He gave me recommendations on different loan types that I didn't even know I was able to qualify for. He ended up answering every question I had, before I was even able to ask them, so he clearly works with 1st time buyers often, which was a huge plus. When I did have a question, he was always super quick to answer my phone calls and texts. Working with Josh was a breeze, and I never had to stress about what needed to be done. Josh and his team were already on top of everything the moment I submitted my loan application.

They made what was such a frustrating process, into an extremely easy and efficient process.\nI was working with another local lender for months and getting nowhere. They weren\u2019t making any effort to make me or my home buying experience a priority and I missed out on a handful of houses that I\u2019d loved to have put offers on because they wouldn\u2019t get back to me with pre approval letters or actual numbers of what I qualified for. When the numbers finally did come through, I would update them with promotions at work and pay increases which somehow made my amount of money drop by $70,000. When brought to their attention, they simply told me that there was nothing they could do because I was a single father paying child support and the only option I had was to somehow workout a deal with my ex wife where I was paying her off the books and there was no record of me having to pay child support. Obviously that was nowhere close to being an option. We wasted 6 months with this company and finally decided to go another direction. Because I was using the VA loan, my realtor suggested I contact Joe Meadow and said he had a good reputation in the community for working with veterans. I thank God I did. Literally from the first phone call, he put me at ease and promised to take care of me. He followed through with that promise and within 3 days of working with him and his team, they had a pre approval letter in my hand for a much more realistic number that would allow me to get into a nice home in a good neighborhood so I could feel that my child and family will be safe and taken care of. I am sure Joe takes care of all of his customers but guys, if you are veterans who are using the VA loan, trust me and go with Joe and Kristi. They will work their tails off for you and you don\u2019t have to worry about tracking them down or having to leave a bunch of messages begging for them to call you back. The process was so much more efficient and productive with them. This was the 4th house I\u2019ve bought and by far the best service from a lender out of all of them.

I implore all Realtors/Buyers/Sellers to stay far away from them & their shady business practices.  They lied to my buyer, my buyer's realtor, me, my realtor, the seller of the house I am buying, that seller's realtor, & the closing attorney.  They lied to everyone throughout the whole loan process assuring us all repeatedly that we were good to go & everything was running on time.  Then less that 24 hours prior to us sitting at the closing table the closing attorney could not get the paperwork out of them for the close & we found out that the originating loan officer, Pierre Brown, was out of the county vacationing.  So this guy goes on vacation knowing he has a loan closing scheduled & he is no where near completing the process!  Mind you even the appraisal had been in MortgageRight's possession for 14 days, the file was never even sent to underwriting.  They just let it sit.  Bottom line if you actually want to buy or sell a home, avoid this company at all costs!\n\nResponse to the owner's response:  BS!  A buyer getting disqualified is fine if you actually finish the loan process & disqualify them in a timely manner.  Instead you sat on documents while your loan officer told all parties involved we were good to go good to close up until the day before closing.  You did a horrible job & your employee lied to everyone.  You even closed your Facebook page down for 2 weeks after this fiasco to avoid all the bad reviews being posted there.  The owner of your shady company even told all of us he was thinking of disproving the borrowers application based on nothing except the fact that your company had received so many phone calls expressing displeasure over the way your shady company handled the situation.

My fianc\u00e9 and I were first time home buyers and after doing our research we decided to try TJC. Danielle was the person who helped us and from the bat I had an uneasy feeling. Should have walked away then. For starters, she kept getting our application information wrong. We were given a different explanation anytime we spoke to her about what numbers to expect. She would repeatedly say things like, \"going to call you at 2:00\" and would either a) call at 10 at night or b) not call at all. She texted everything. Which I normally would be fine with but with it being such confidential info I felt like it was super unprofessional. The day that we got our pre approval letter she kept telling me that we would not qualify for the particular one we were going for, I asked why because she had been telling us we were approved for 3 weeks. She called my fianc\u00e9 by the wrong name and I corrected her in the next email and she then informed me that she had sent me the wrong information and that we were approved. She had not only gotten me confused with someone else but she had sent us someone else's information! I then knew that persons name, financial information, had their application, etc. She immediately texted me and said something along the lines of \"omg like so sorry, someone else has a similar name as you please disregard those emails\" And then proceeded to tell me WHY these people were being denied, telling me even more information about their finances. I was so thrown off. She begged for us to still use them for our mortgage and like a dummy I said ok. Only because we were so far into this. I told her my concerns of her never answering my calls, getting us confused with other applicants, etc and she promised to do right. FOOLISH ME. So we find a house on a Saturday, very competitive house. We decided to put an offer down on Sunday. I called Danielle on Saturday to tell her we would need some info for our realtor to finish our offer letter the following morning. After HOURS she texts me (of course, no call back) and was said she would get right on it. Well we go to our realtors office the next morning and she tells me that she tried contacting Danielle three times, all in different forms of communication and never heard back. We went on a limb and used another mortgage lender that we had been recommended from friends and she did everything for us from start to finish in about 20 minutes. I called, texted, and emailed Danielle that we were not using them anymore and why. Danielle texted our realtor that next WEDNESDAY our information that we requested that Saturday. She ignored my messages of us saying we were giving them the boot. Had we stayed with TJC we would have lost our house that we were wanting. Danielle Charlnoes was easily the most unprofessional person I have EVER worked with and I am so thankful we went a different route. We know several couples in the home buying process and after hearing of our experience they have chosen to do their mortgages elsewhere.

With just over a month before closure, we were frantic and in search of a jumbo loan product that was within our budget. After explaining our situation to Jason, he calmly asked for an hour to do some research on his end and within 45 minutes was back in touch with a viable option.\n\nDue to our previous relationship we were skeptical that we could get through the approval process ahead of a looming closure. Jason and his team did everything they committed to us up front and the final closing cost worksheet was within 3% of the estimated charges he provided us at the start.\n\nFurthermore, my wife and I were able to speak to Jason anytime we wanted throughout the process. This was not needed since his 5 star team was consistently updating and communicating with us as well. Special shout out to Alyssa Weinberg (Loan Officer Assistant) and Crystal Bunn (Mortgage Loan Processor) for the excellent support and communication.\n\nWe highly recommend engaging with Jason Lee and his team.

I first contacted David Digesu on 2/13/2020 inquiring about a 15 year refi and on or around 3/3/2020 we formally began the process. Then from 3/13/2020 to 4/5/2020 we did not receive any communication or status update from David or 1FMC, despite our multiple emails and phone calls to both David\u2019s cell and the 1FMC office. During this time gap, on 3/27/2020, Sean Hollis performed our appraisal. Finally on April 5, David contacted us, apologized for going AWOL and provided the appraisal.  Sean\u2019s report appraised our home at around $25K below our 2017 purchase price while acknowledging in his report that our neighborhood \"is showing moderate growth with stable to increasing property values\u201d. We, of course, found Sean\u2019s appraisal unacceptable and David suggested we request a reconsideration, which we immediately agreed to do. I think David requested the reconsideration, but I really don\u2019t know because from 4/5/2020 to 5/1/2020 (26 days if you\u2019re keeping count) we did not receive any kind of real update. David\u2019s replies were more of a \u201ckick the can\u201d approach. Finally on 5/1/2020, completely frustrated, I emailed David asking for a status and stating that we either needed to move forward or cut bait and go somewhere else. On 5/6/2020, to my utter shock and disbelief, David replied that we should go to a different mortgage company because he had \"tried everything he could think of\". Completely incensed at this point and having already spent $500 for the appraisal, I replied to David on 5/7/2020 at 8:45am that walking away at this point was unacceptable. I asked David to send me the documentation of both the formal request for reconsideration that was filed and the formal response from AMS denying our reconsideration because I was going to file formal complaint to the Alabama Real Estate Appraisers Board. Amazingly, at 5:31pm of that same day, we received an email from Casey Brannon of 1FMC containing our new appraisal with an updated value. We then had to resign documents but finally on 5/26/2020, Casey emailed me stating that our loan was clear to close and the title company had an opening on Monday 6/1/2020 @ 3:30pm. The following evening I replied to Casey confirming that this date and time would work. On 6/1/2020 at 3:15pm we arrived at the title company\u2019s office and sat in their waiting area for over 30 minutes when the closing attorney came around the corner to tell us that we would not be closing. She had just received an email from 1FMC stating that the closing documents were not ready. Once again, David and no one from 1FMC contacted me or my wife to let us know what was going on. We had left work early that day to make the appointment 1FMC offered us and then would once again have to take off early later that week to close on Friday 6/5/2020 at 4pm. In summary, I first contacted David on 2/13/2020, on or around 3/3/2020 we formally began the process, and did not close until 6/5/2020 at no fault of our own. Depending on which start date you choose, that\u2019s between 94 and 113 days to close! That is ridiculous and unacceptable! Our entire experience with David and 1FMC was unprofessional and lacked any regard or empathy for our well-being. There's is no way I could, would or will ever refer anyone to 1FMC.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212cf1040ed27:0x8f44a3127659e93b"}

Now the loan process went very well, it was afterwards that went to pot. We were asked several times if we wanted our information used in the advertisements to which we said no each and every time. I am the type person that does not like anyone knowing my business. Well after we closed on our loan I even called and requested to speak to Conrad Thompson on how well pleased that I was with his employees to which I was redirected right away. He is where it went downhill fast. A week went by and I had a friend text me on a Tuesday asking if I went to 1st FM and refinanced that he heard it on the radio. Wednesday morning my wife called and wanted to know why our names were on the radio when we SPECIFICALLY said the we did not want our names on any advertisements, they apologized and said that the advertising people must have made a mistake and that it would be removed immediately. Later that day I received a call from the two people that we dealt with in the loan process apologizing about the mishap. Friday morning I was on my way to work and I heard the commercial with our name in it so I called them immediately wanting to know why it was still on after they promised me that it would not be. The lady told me that Sunday would definitely be the pulled then I then requested to want to talk to Conrad Thompson whom they said was not there and I left my number for him to return my call which he did not. Well Tuesday rolls around and low and behold my wife calls me and says that it is STILL on the radio! By now I am furious because I have been repeatedly lied to. I call back up there and get the same story that it shouldn't be on there so I request again to talk to Mr. Thompson and have the same results. So in conclusion if you love for everyone around the country to know your business,  then definitely contact 1st Family Mortgage!

We had decided to go with another company. The new company was a dream to work with. We were waiting on the approval from FHA...well to no surprise our appraisal we had done with 1st Family was invalid. FHA would not accept the appraisal because there was some discrepancies. Yet again they have screwed me over. I wrote Conrad and said I wanted to talk to him. I received a call from his vice president. He said they wanted to make it right and presented me with two options. Basically one reimbursed us for some stuff we had to have done and the other was a lower rate. We had decided to go with one of their options. I call the vice president Monday morning and well those are all off the table. He apparently had no business in giving me any offers because Conrad did not approve those. First of all if you are doing business with a customer you need to have all your numbers right and if you don't have the  authority to give me options then don't call. Conrad should have been the one to call. Each time we would talk to them the cash back we were suppose to get back was $1000 less. I understand when you give me numbers they will be different from a few hundred dollars but several $1000. You need to get your crap together before you approach a customer to make it right. We decided not to sign with them because frankly I wouldn't feel great about signing with them. I would have felt it would have been a deal with the devil. I have asked them to at least refund me my appraisal since apparently their appraiser can't do their job right. They have yet to respond. Do not use these guys! You can find lower rates and definitely closing costs!  If for some reason you do go with them. Use a different appraiser and do not use who they recommend. I am sure their are some kick backs going on there. Do not use their termite either! Do research you might not need a termite if you are doing a refinance. We royally got screwed over from 1st Family and I hope no one else suffers the financial costs we have.

His efficiency is exemplified in his ability to close on my house within 30 days of me winning the bid on the house.\n\nAbove all, KC is transparent and trustworthy.

KC represented himself and First Federal Mortgage in a remarkable fashion.\n\nI also had the opportunity of working with KC's assistant, Haley Roscoe.

After touring the property, we made an offer for Casey to present to the sellers.  As we were leaving, Casey asked if I had already gotten pre-approval status from a lender, and I said no, that I was going to contact Quicken Loans, whom I had some history with, for the mortgage.  Casey recommended Michael at Envoy Mortgage stating she had numerous clients that had worked with Michael and were very pleased.  Based on that recommendation, I went with Envoy and I was extremely pleased with how everything worked out.  Michael was with me and Sandi every step of the way.
