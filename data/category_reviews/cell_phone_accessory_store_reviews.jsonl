But\u2014 I had gotten my phone screen \u201cfixed\u201d at a rival store (the one in the mall), and they failed to install my screen correctly.... twice. And left my battery loose in the phone so that it was not glued down as it originally was to the inside. They also failed to glue in and screw in my new screen properly. I walked into this other store with a lose screw clanging around in the phone. So. I came here, to the Cell Phone Doctor to have it PROPERLY fixed, based on reviews I had seen. I made a great choice. He immediately told me what they had done wrong, fixed the battery issue with no extra charge, and was nothing but kind and fast at his work. A real expert. I had no issues, he was very respectful and easy to deal with, and a few weeks out I\u2019ve had no issues! So I suppose it\u2019s good that I\u2019m late to reviewing, as I can see that it is still holding up perfectly!

And left my battery loose in the phone so that it was not glued down as it originally was to the inside. They also failed to glue in and screw in my new screen properly. I walked into this other store with a lose screw clanging around in the phone. So. I came here, to the Cell Phone Doctor to have it PROPERLY fixed, based on reviews I had seen. I made a great choice. He immediately told me what they had done wrong, fixed the battery issue with no extra charge, and was nothing but kind and fast at his work. A real expert. I had no issues, he was very respectful and easy to deal with, and a few weeks out I\u2019ve had no issues!

He immediately told me what they had done wrong, fixed the battery issue with no extra charge, and was nothing but kind and fast at his work. A real expert.

The cool part is that they protect the screen so that it doesn't break again with a cover that is not likely to break. This location is the exception. I just wanted to buy the screen over the phone and have it shipped so that I could travel only once to the store. This store is a bit of a journey for me.  They would not under any circumstance take a credit card over the phone and do this for the customer that is in Cellairis' customer data base. I am so visible on the internet. It makes me wonder if perhaps they had an employee who took customer information and used it for something nefarious. The idea that they could not take payment over the phone is odd in this day and age. I simply found them to be adversarial and not interested in one more customer. Every other Cellairis I have ever been to was completely amazing. If this is the worse thing that happens to me I will be just fine.

Also, their selection of cases is massive and full of variety. Call them about estimates and such.\n\n3 hours ago, the phone I am typing this on wouldn't turn on and the screen was cracked badly after a very bad day. By the time I got off work, it was 7:45, and all other phone repair shops in town were closed. It's Veterans Day weekend which means a lot of places are closed for the next day or two. Thank god Cellairis was open. I called and asked for an estimate before going and asked about a student discount and screen protector. Shyna gave me an incredible deal for calling that made this struggling college student feel sooooooo much better. And when there was confusion between what Shyna told me on the phone and what I was told in one store (since there are two locations in the mall, Shyna's deal was honored!! One of the things they test for after fixing a phone wasn't met when I came to pick up my phone, and Shyna worked on my phone well past their closing hours and tested it until it met their standards. Rachel stayed to help out as well and make sure everything went well and I was satisfied. They both were very kind, and they both were so very helpful! They also talked to me like a normal person and explained what they were doing when I asked, and they were very friendly. It's been a while since I have had service that nice! Thank you both so much!\n\nBrenna", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da3023c6d63:0x2ba54fb5ac2c2dd9"}

Also, their selection of cases is massive and full of variety. Call them about estimates and such.\n\n3 hours ago, the phone I am typing this on wouldn't turn on and the screen was cracked badly after a very bad day. By the time I got off work, it was 7:45, and all other phone repair shops in town were closed. It's Veterans Day weekend which means a lot of places are closed for the next day or two. Thank god Cellairis was open. I called and asked for an estimate before going and asked about a student discount and screen protector. Shyna gave me an incredible deal for calling that made this struggling college student feel sooooooo much better. And when there was confusion between what Shyna told me on the phone and what I was told in one store (since there are two locations in the mall, Shyna's deal was honored!! One of the things they test for after fixing a phone wasn't met when I came to pick up my phone, and Shyna worked on my phone well past their closing hours and tested it until it met their standards. Rachel stayed to help out as well and make sure everything went well and I was satisfied. They both were very kind, and they both were so very helpful! They also talked to me like a normal person and explained what they were doing when I asked, and they were very friendly. It's been a while since I have had service that nice! Thank you both so much!\n\nBrenna", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da3023c6d63:0x2ba54fb5ac2c2dd9"}

I spoke with a guy name Duncan(maybe not his name, not sure) and he gave me a price and told me it would take 5 DAYS for it to be fixed and returned back to me. I dropped my watch off on April 16th almost at closing time. It is April 30th and I still have not received my watch. I\u2019ve called multiple times to check the status and every time they tell me it will be back in a couple of days. I called Monday and I was told he received tracking and that it\u2019ll be here in a couple of days. I sent a friend to the place of business to get a status update and my friend was told that it shipped today ( April 30th) and will be here in a few days. So I called back up there and talked to the same guy and he told me that they received tracking information Monday but it didn\u2019t ship until today (BS). I also made him aware that my last day in the area would be Sunday and I will need my watch before I leave, he says if it\u2019s not here by Sunday we can ship it to you ( which I\u2019m sure will be another week).

I'm sorry that you felt that this review was necessary as well as  the conversation and language you used with us on the phone the other day was necessary but we do sincerely wish you the best.\n\nJF"}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb3a2b95f70b3:0xf0e2be23900e1414"}

Cristy says she won't be there because it's Halloween but I can drop off my phone and pick it up if I want to come in.  Although I had plans for Halloween,  I cancel so I can get my phone  fixed.

CPR with their prices could literally take your phone to B-ham and have lunch and still earn over $200 per phone (when you include labor). Wouldn't be surprised if that is what they do. The guy that waited on me knew the price at the Apple Store when I mentioned it. That is pure speculation on my part; but, this CPR place is a mess and totally unprofessional.\n\nMy advice--take a trip to the Apple Store (get an appointment first) and the folks there will make your phone like new for $149. The money you'll save will more than pay for the trip and you'll have enough left over to enjoy a nice lunch at all the great restaurants at \"The Summit.\"\n\nIf you MUST get your phone repaired in Montgomery--I suggest \"Total Cell Phone Repair.\" They charge parts + $55 labor--or $235. That's still expensive; but, at least they are honest on the price of the screen.

I have never in my life dealt with such an unprofessional group of people. Before I brought my phone to these people, every single thing on it worked perfectly. The only issue I had is that there was a scratch on the left side of the screen that irritated me. So I tried to do the right thing and support a local business (or at least a business in the area). On August 5, 2015, I prepaid $161.49 for a screen and service for an iPhone 6. I was told that I would be notified when the parts arrived.\n\nDays go by, and I don't hear from them. I had to call on the 11th and finally ask what exactly was going on. They had an excuse about how their delivery of parts was delayed. Either way, they'd have it the next day. So I'm pretty understanding, and I agree that'd be fine. I take the phone in on August 12. Again, they do not call me - I had to turn up and see whether it was done. I wait approximately 10 minutes after arriving since they were apparently still working on it. Everything looked good initially when I got it back, but I started noticing problems almost right away on the phone.\n\nThere was an absolutely immense battery drain on the phone, but more importantly than even that was the ambient light sensor not working, the backlighting at the top of the phone was WAY off, (and they should have noticed that if nothing else if they repair phones for a living) and the proximity sensor wasn't working. If you don't know what a proximity sensor is, when you hold a smartphone up to your head to talk, it shuts the screen off so it doesn't register contact with the screen. It makes it very difficult to use your phone as a phone when it isn't working. The next day, on August 13, I call them back and explain the issue. They agree to take a look at it again and see if there's something they missed. I understand that sometimes, these things happen.\n\nCan't make it there before close on August 14, but I do arrive on August 15th. Another employee looks at the phone, and says that there's just an issue with the screen at this point. They'll have to order another screen to resolve these issues. It's frustrating, but I understand, and I agree, and ask them to contact me when it is in. I waited 10 days, and heard nothing from them. Called a little late in the day on August 25th, and I was told that they got the part in either the day before or that day. So, I mean, thanks for the heads up, right? Can't make it there that day, so I take it in on August 26th.\n\nOn August 26th, I drop the phone off yet again around 12:00. The employee says they're a little backed up, but they should hopefully have it ready in about 2 1/2 hours. I told him it was fine. Close to that time later, I got a call saying the screen was on the phone, and they were going to test the other functions. Got another call later, and they told me that the screen was working fine, but that they could not get the proximity sensor to work. They claimed to have tested different parts, but they simply could not get the proximity sensor to work on the phone. I asked how we intended to resolve this issue, especially since it worked when I brought it to them.\n\nI was told that they could either place a damaged screen on the phone (not my original screen in this case, but one that was much, much more damaged) and get a refund, or that basically, I'd have to live with it. This is literally three weeks to this point, and I absolutely need that telephone. Time I don't have it almost always translates to lost productivity. So essentially, my choice was to get my phone back in worse shape than I brought it in, and get my money back, or to keep the screen and they don't fix an issue they caused. I essentially had no real choice in the matter. I am contacting my credit card company to get my money back. They are a terrible business, and your money would be better spent anywhere else. They should be ashamed, but they're not.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2aff2bb6f42d:0x58cd2a6eddd97f48"}

Terrible products (their brand) Good luck getting in touch with the manager. The reviews here must be from employees.\n\nI had a screen break. They fixed it. Took an incredibly long time. I walked around for a little while and the guy who started fixing my phone was texting his fingers off until I interrupted him to ask if he was done with my phone (Of course not). After getting my phone back and insisting on an Otter Box the employee (Ferris) convinced me that the glass screen protector he had could break, BUT IT WOULD SAVE THE PHONE'S SCREEN. He even showed me where it saved the store's IPad. Having a thinner phone than with the Otter Box had its appeals, I even bought a minimal case to be extra sure. After a week of babying my phone, I made the mistake of bending over with it in my front pocket (3ish ft fall). Glass protector and the screen shattered. I was pretty pissed.\n\nWent back to the store. New girl (Magen) seemed a little overwhelmed with helping other people so I was relatively nice to her. She told me that Ferris was promoted to manage his own store (watch out).I told her the story and asked for a refund of the defective glass screen and plastic case (both failed at doing their job and cost me another screen). She refused because she didn't have the authority. I asked to speak to the manager and she called him from her cell phone and walked outside (abandoned kiosk in the eastdale mall could have been costly) left me there and came back. Nope, the manager wouldn't do anything either, and I wasn't allowed to speak to him (STORE POLICY!!!!) She cut $10 off the new glass screen and gave me the managers email address.\n\nI am only writing this after attempting to contact the manager for the past two weeks(Chris Vick) I'm normally not the kind of guy that would do this. However, this business has terrible products that promote future phone screen replacements (kind of brilliant), have terrible customer service and even worse management.\n\n$400 taught me a valuable lesson about Cellairis...If I ever break my phone again, Ill support the Arabs a few kiosks down.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bd6bfae039f:0xfdc231c1c62d09d8"}

I then asked if I could come there and purchase the power supply for $80 minus the $35 that had already been paid. At first the answer was yes you can do that but we won\u2019t guarantee the part. I said I was fine with that. As the conversation progressed and I pressed for a solid answer on the purchase person number four (apparently the top of the ladder there) he began to to fish tail. He said power supplies can range in price. I reminded him the technician actually showed the power supply to my son that was needed for his computer. The price tag said $80. He said you can bring the computer back and we will look at it before the EOB today. At this point I wouldn\u2019t trust these people to hold a penny. Person number four hung up me. It\u2019s a scam.

His diligent slogging through 9 phone support personnel from 5 different departments, including 4 different people from \"Porting Activations\" (which is apparently based somewhere in Russia...) made us both laugh, and nearly cry, and turned what would have been a soul crushing experience into something I will look back on mostly fondly.\n\nI cannot recommend T-Mobile highly enough after all this, but if you choose AT&T (or if you're contractually glued to them), do yourself a HUGE favor and go see Jermaine at this location if you need any changes made that involve changes to your account itself.\n\n(Note: the other 3 CSRs there all seem very nice too, but I dealt with Jermaine and this is mostly a review of his performance, which was excellent.  Don't let this discourage you from trying one of the others, though.)\n\nP.S. I've noticed some other reviewers say you should try the Tigertown store.  I've been there twice, including earlier in the day yesterday, and they were zero help.

I've been a wireless customer of AT&T for 12 years and when this place popped up near my work, I decided to use it to replace my upgefukked LG G3.\nBig mistake. I cracked the screen, first time ever, and went back to this location and was told, basically I was out of luck. I didn't take the insurance. What insurance? It was never mentioned nor offered.\nOK. My bad. I went to 3 different repair centers, non-AT&T, and was quoted ~$100 at each place. After a lengthy wait at each place (7-10 days) I was told the screen on this LG G35 ThinQ was different in camera location from any screens they could get.\nHmmmm...\nI went to \"first-in-town\" AT&T store and was told, and I quote: \"...oh. Those stores aren't really AT&T stores. They are \"Authorized Re-sellers, only. You should have come here. We don't even sell the G35.\"\nI returned, once again, to the re-seller and we had a Come to Jesus Meeting. I'm big and was pretty TO'ed. They agreed to get it repaired, at my cost, by sending it to LG in Ft. Worth TX. They did fix it. $152.\n\nIn short: do NOT use these \"re-seller\" stores. They are akin to \"Big Lots\".

So, I ran a battery testing app on it, and the replacement they installed performed WORSE than the original battery that was being replaced (the original was over 2 years old!)\n\nSo I brought it back to tell the owner, and he had the nerve to put a second garbage battery in my phone.

I asked him why it was like that, and he stuttered and basically said nothing.\n\nI got my money back and ordered a do-it-yourself kit from amazon, and what do ya know, the battery works great and performs really well on my testing app. These guys are scam artists and they get away with it because most people would never think to act that way.\n\nBe very careful here, or go somewhere else.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1537291494172, "text": "Dear Zachary.

They said they ordered a screen to repair my broken one, but on the day the screen was to arrive, they had absolutely no record of the location of the screen or even if it had been ordered.

Steven M, their technician, cannot tell the location of the screen, or even if it has been ordered (even though he supposedly placed the order). Steven doesn't seem terribly concerned about checking the status until I show up in front of him. There is no response to my texts and certainly no pro-active checking on his part. Today I decided that if they cannot even tell whether a part has been ordered or where it is, then they certainly cannot be trusted to actually perform a repair.

They are not very knowledgeable about issues that you are having with your phone.  I have two contacts in my phone that call and get sent straight to VM.  It doesn\u2019t show a missed call either.  I ran through 1.5 hours with apple on a chat.  Checked online after they couldn\u2019t fix it and found that the only thing that i had not tried is a new SIM card. I figured what could it hurt i have tried everything else.  He changed my SIM card and gave my phone back to me after checking the usual and asking the same questions that i had already told him that apple support sent me through. He even suggested that if the callers that went straight to VM had my number blocked.  I can call them but they cannot call me.  This doesn\u2019t make any sense.  After a couple of minutes with the new SIM card my service had not activated yet.  I mentioned it to him. He checked the phone line and said that it is a good on his end that it could take up to six hours and if it still did not have service to call att and they would take care of the issue over the phone.  Just one question i have is why are they even there if they have no idea how these things work and if they have to have me call att just to activate my card.  Worthless in my opinion.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1614557983123, "text": "Hello Brock, This is not the experience we wanted you to have.

I paid my $100 deposit in cash and was told my installation date. The day came for installation and no one showed. I reached out to the employee Scott who created my order and he said because of the rain there were delays. I ended up getting an approx. date for installation from Bishop which was on a Sunday(which At&t is closed...so how was that). Of course, no one showed. So I called At&t directly and inquired about it and was told they saw the account created but they saw nothing about my payment or info of an installation date for me. I made another $100 deposit with my debit card directly with At&t & I was advised to go back to the store to obtain a full refund of the cash payment. I've gotten the biggest run around at this store. They tell me I'm going to get my money back and they'd call me but NO ONE EVER CALLS ME WITH ANYTHING! I've constantly had to go out to this store just to see what the status was and they always tell me they are working on it and would call! NEVER HAPPENED! I finally spoke to the manager Sam and he supposedly filled out the necessary paperwork on the computer so I could get my refund sent via check in the mail within six weeks. ITS BEEN 5 MONTHS!! NO CHECK!! Went out there yet again and Scott informs me that Sam's no longer with them and they now have a temp manager and he wasn't going to address him with the issue because he wasn't going to be there long. Scott said the district manager was coming to the store a little later that evening to drop off a customer's phone. He assured he get my concern to the district manager once he arrived at the store and he would call me also once he arrived so I could speak to him. NEVER HAPPENED! I popped up on a different day and spoke to the temp manager and he agreed that it shouldn't have been this complicated and he'd look into it. Come to find out the employee Scott made an error by taking cash instead of a credit/debit card. He rung it up as if I was making a cell deposit which allowed the acceptance of cash because if he rung it up as internet it wouldn't have allowed him to accept cash instead it would've prompted for credit/debit card. The temp manager said he emailed two different people on the cell phone side to see how he can go about obtaining my refund and he said he'd call me. Things felt promising because it seemed he was being genuine! He said he'd called once he heard something(which would take a few days). I've given it almost two weeks and no call no nothing! I called a day ago to speak with the temp manager and Bishop told me he was with a customer. Bishop asked for my name, contact number, and reason for wanting to speak to him. Bishop said he'd have him call and I thought he would since he was in the store. I WAS WRONG! IM STILL YET TO GET ANYWHERE WITH THIS MATTER AND MY PATIENCE IS VERY THIN AT THIS POINT! IM SICK AND TIRED OF THE RUN AROUND! I JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN PUT THIS MATTER BEHIND ME! I'VE BEEN MORE THAN PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING!!! I know they have other things on their to do list but I feel that my situation should be some form of a priority given that the mistake was on the employee. It shouldn't take over 5 months for this situation to be resolved but when the workers aren't trying to do nothing about it....nothing will get done! Every time I've went out there everyone is just standing around doing the usual. I feel nobody is taking it seriously nor are they putting in a conscious effort to ensure I get my refund!!

Although, the store phone rang several times while I was there and the other employees in the store did not answer it.\n\nAfter finding out that the phone would not work for the purpose I had brought it, I looked to return it. Well this was after several attempts in trying to make it work. I called the store on the 14th day, because I had recently had a procedure and can't drive myself. I was trying to get someone at the store to see how I needed to proceed or if I could proceed, but the phone was never answered on the three times I called  I was given the opportunity to go by the store today on the 15th day and was denied returning my phone.\n\nI understand that there are policies and procedures that have to be followed, but I feel this could have been handled differently. As a manager, I know that some times you have to go against policies to take care of your customers....

So, about 21 years now. Anyway...\n\nOn Tuesday, 11/02/2020 (Election Day) my iphone went out due to water damage. So, I had to get a new one. I had absolutely NO intention of purchasing ANYthing in store, because of the not so good experiences I\u2019ve had at nearby AT&T stores (Schillinger Rd S) l. I\u2019d rather buy online. Even said that to a friend before I called, ha!\nHowever, I had some questions. So, I googled AT&T. I clicked on the first location that popped up, which happened to be the one in Semmes on Moffett and Schillinger. A young man by the name of Jarius answered the phone. Immediately, I could tell how friendly he was and quite humorous\ud83d\ude06 One of those people who you know right off, is just a kind and genuine guy, ya know? He went out of his way to answer the questions I had. Even answered questions I didn\u2019t even ask, but wanted to. Questions that I was afraid to ask. Mainly, because of the last location (Schillinger Rd S) I went to (about a year ago) to get my watch, seemed annoyed and rushed from the very beginning. Which made me feel like a burden rather than a paying customer. It\u2019s actually happened every time I\u2019ve been to that location. Never thought to go to another, because I just assumed that they all act that way. Due to such poor service in the past, it\u2019s now come to the point where I dread having to get any new device from them. Although, that all changed after speaking to Jarius for that brief moment on the phone. After getting the information I needed, I made it a point to go to the Moffett Rd location to purchase my new phone from HIM, specifically. Which ended up being a great decision! I knew exactly who he was when I walked in, based on seeing his pleasant demeanor and friendly facial expressions towards other customers.\n\nHe greeted me, and I told him  what I wanted. He didn\u2019t even ask me what color I wanted. Instead, he took it upon himself to bring ALL five colors out, so I could see them up close in order to make my decision. I chose my phone. He took it out of the box...next thing you know\u2014\u2014\u2014HE has my WHOLE phone set up for me! Even did the facial recognition. This has NEVER happened. From walking in, to leaving, it took about 20 minutes, maybe? Typically, it takes at least an hour to get the phone \u2014which they just give to me to take home and do it myself. Which for me? Takes another hour or two, ha!  By the way, [in the past] I\u2019ve asked them to help me, and they\u2019ve refused. Claiming it\u2019s against policy. Which, I know now, is a lazy lie. It\u2019s been a few days since I\u2019ve gotten my new phone, and yet, I\u2019m still thinking about and telling others of the excellent service I received\u2014sending people their way. Also, I HAVE to mention Tre (the manager) who came over while Jarius was doing his thing. He came over to make sure everything was going smoothly and checked to see if I was getting the best deals they had to offer\u2014which HE made sure I did\ud83d\ude4fHe was friendly, personable, and just all around pleasant. He didn\u2019t have to come over, because Jarius had it all under control. However,  he did, and I saw him doing that with all of the other customers as well. Those two really want people to be satisfied and it\u2019s completely evident.\n\nI, myself, have worked in customer service for about 15 years. So, I appreciate and know good (great!) service when I see it.  As long as Jarius and Tre are working for AT&T\u2014I will continue to go there. Because I literally put off getting a new phone for 2 years (had it for 4) because it always seemed like a chore any time I was thinking of getting a new one. I know this review is a bit lengthy...but the experience was like no other, that just couldn\u2019t be explained in a short summary. That, and they deserve it! Again, thank you Jarius and Tre!!\ud83e\udd17", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bac3edf139c77:0x4fa1700a7dc1ce3a"}

When I arrived Brittany greeted me at the door with a very pleasant personality.  I explained to her and Catherine, also pleasant, my situation and Catherine started the process for the suspension.  Alex was also nearby and provided very good information and advice during my visit.  While Catherine was on hold with the Verizon rep on the phone, she noticed from viewing my account that she could save me money by utilizing the promotion that was ongoing to pay off my daughter's phone and also upgrade my wife's.  Since my wife was at work at that time, I told Catherine and Brittany that I would return with her that evening to take care of everything.  When we returned we were greeted by Christie, one more person with warmth and courteousness, who helped us get started with the process once again.  Our experience was the best one we have had with any Verizon store in town.  We were made to feel right at home, and even when the process hit a snag, through no fault of their own, we were still pleased with the outcome.  Even Scott, who was not involved with assisting us, provided good conversation and hospitality.  In the end, my daughter's services were suspended, my wife upgraded her phone and my bill decreased by approximately $75.  After it was over we were still there 20 minutes later just talking.  We even \"adopted\" Brittany as our second daughter.  Everyone at that store are valuable assets to the Verizon company and brand.\nJOB WELL DONE!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605210078540, "text": "Chris, thanks for that shout out!

Everyone has different needs and habits. Michael V. has been a great help to all of us making sure each person has the right phone for their needs and their habits. We have quite a variety of personalities; dad doesn\u2019t like change, some of us are accident prone, and others use their devices to manage all aspects of their lives. Michael has helped us on several occasions find the right fit for each person not only in devices but even in the accessories for each person. He is very knowledgeable about all the devices and the accessories. Personally, I am amazed at his patience with all the questions many of which I am sure we asked more than once. Thanks to Michael I feel we all get the most out of our devices and make the most of all the bells and whistles for each device. We all are very busy juggling life in general and we struggle to find the time to visit the store once let alone for every issue or family member. Trying schedule with time with each family member is difficult in the best of times, but this year it has been even more difficult with the need to be cautious because of the pandemic. Michael is always willing to work with us to find a way to schedule us in and has on occasion been very understanding about last minute changes. During those visits to the store, he made sure we felt comfortable with the procedures in place for preventing the spread of COVID. From helping us schedule a time to visit  inside with reduce numbers to being willing bring purchases to the car. On two occasions, I have had to call him from out of state to help deal with phone issues.  The first time, I was on the other side of the country when my husband who was at home reluctantly needed to replace his five-year-old phone. Michael handled the situation with his usually wonderful manner coaxing my husband into a new phone and making sure the transition as painless as possible for my husband (and me!!). The most recent of those was when we were all out of state and my daughter\u2019s phone  broke and she was driving in a different vehicle and needed to have a phone. Fortunately, we found an old phone for her to use because we couldn\u2019t wait for insurance replacement. Michael took the time to walk us through the steps and called to follow up and make sure my daughter had everything set up so she could have access to a phone. It gives me great piece of mind to know that each family member has access to the help they need from someone we trust and are able to stay connected even when I or they are out of state. Thanks to Michael I believe we are getting the best value for our money. It seems like every time I talk to him; I save money. I can\u2019t find the words to express how grateful I am for the piece of mind I have.

I called the 800 number and the person informed me that with the unlimited plan you can not use you're work discounts. I was very aggverted to hear that. I was misinformed. The guy on the phone could do very little to fix the problem. At that point I was going to turn in my phone because it seemed to me that Verizon doesn't care about it's customers. But a day later Kara from Cellular sales prattville called me and apologized for misleading me. At first I figured it was just the company's way to make me stay. But as we talked and she told me what she can do to fix this and the whole time she kept telling me she was sorry I could hear it in her voice. Her actions and her dedication to me the customer was outstanding. Because of her I am keeping Verizon and I am extremely happy with my phone. Thank you Kara.

The rep gave us customer service phone number and an insurance pamplet and sent us on our way. Turns out the device was covered under a WARRANTY.....customer service is replacing the device free of charge unlike this location that provided poor service quality to a customer who has been with Verizon for over 10 years. We will not be back to this location as calling a phone number was more useful instead of getting suckered into upgrading a device that is less than 6mo old or using insurance for a manufacturer defect. They also were unwilling to assist with applying a discount on the account and again gave me the number for customer service.

Those are installed during manufacturing to prevent scratches and has to be removed for full functionality. Please check and make sure there isn't anything blocking the ear speaker itself, if so please remove it. If that is not the problem, please bring it by and we will take care of the problem for you.

When you called a month ago, I explained to you that the charging port that controls the charging portion of the phone is part of the motherboard and not something that can be damaged during screen repair as we transfer over the whole motherboard. If it was damaged, it would not have been able to charge at all. I recommended trying a different charger to see if it was a charger issue and if not, bring it by and we would help take a look at it for you. When I didn\u2019t hear back from you, I assumed the problem was resolved.\n\nCharging issues like that are usually caused by charger going bad, broken solder joint on the charging port (caused by accidental bend of charger while plugged in), or sometimes if the battery is going out. So I think it is very unfair to us to give us such a bad review without giving us a chance to look at it and try to resolve the issue with you. Being a small local business, reviews like that can hurt us in a big way.\n\nSo if you can please give us a chance to properly diagnose your phone and resolve this issue, I would really really appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can reach me at our Store phone number (251)665-9888 during business hour.\n\nThank you very much and I hope to hear from you soon"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4cd6e4d39e05:0xe5df27fa39089580"}

Drove 45 miles to their store was told it'd be $300.00 just for parts.  Found another place that fixed it for $85.00 in 45 minutes. I hate being lied to to get business.\nEdit for reply:\nMy wife called Tuesday 1/5/21 and told whoever answered the phone, after telling them my issue (power button on my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus fell off). She was told that it wouldn't be a problem and no appointment needed that it'd be $79.00. As I mentioned before I live 45 miles away, I had to leave work early to make sure I had ample time to get there and to get service.\nYes, you are correct,  there was not a record or service ticket made because the guy there looked at my phone said that I'd have to leave it and that the parts would be $300.00 because the board would have to be changed out that the button was all one unit. I value my time and money as much as everyone else and I left without your service. Yes, I do feel like the initial phone call was a bait and switch just to get someone in the store. You know that $19.99 oil change costs $500 because you need tires,wipers, injector cleaning and \"blinker fluid\". It's just strange that my wife was told one thing and I was told another. I called another shop  told them exactly what was wrong, they said same thing. No problem, no appointment needed.  Took phone, they looked at it and the fixed it for the amount quoted.\nFunny thing that one shop said one thing and the other one did it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610116073880, "text": "Jason, I cannot find a repair ticket or record of your name, are you sure you have the right place? If so, I would like to reach out to you to find out what happened, as we do not give bogus pricing to obtain business. Mistakes do happen and if this indeed did happen, I'd love the chance to make it right!\n\nWe have a proven track record of being transparent throughout our entire repair process and we pride ourselves on having some of the best pricing in the industry. I especially appreciate this review because it gives me a chance to explain our repair process.\n\nBefore I start, i'd like to point out one thing, there is a giant discrepancy between $80.00 and $300.00. The only phone parts that cost this much are some of the Genuine Samsung Display Assemblies. If another shop was able to resolve this for $85.00, it was a small part repair, like a charging port or proxy sensor, for example. (If parts were needed.) My point is, our prices would have been comparable.\n\nWhen a customer calls in to obtain a price on a particular repair we do our best to go over the details of the problem or issue they are experiencing. If we are confident we know the solution to the issue at hand, we then will give you a price or at least a ballpark figure, so they know what to expect. If we are unsure what the solution is to the issue, we will ask you to bring the device in to be diagnosed, before giving you a price on the repair.\n\nThe Process.\n\n1. Once you come into our office, we go over the details of the issue you are experiencing with your device. We will then go over repair solutions or inform you that it will need further diagnostics to obtain the solution to the issue.\n\n2. We then obtain all your contact information and create you a ticket. We may at this time give you a price on the repair. Below are a couple normal situations.\n\n*Lets go over a couple examples, an iPhone 8, the screen is damaged, everything else on the device is working as intended (we verify this,) we give you a price on the display assembly replacement and an ETA for expected completion.\n\n*Now, lets say its a Gaming Computer, it is randomly turning off or blue screening. We will not know what the issue is without diagnosing all the hardware. In this situation, we will inform you that we will need to perform additional diagnostics to know what it will take to repair this device.\n\n3. Once we have obtained the device, we then will start the diagnostics or repair in the order that it came in. We have other repairs in front of new repairs. Your device will go into the queue and will be worked on when its ticket is next. There are two exceptions to this. Most phone screen repairs, if we have the parts on hand (which we do for all iPhones and some Samsungs,) are completed in an hour or less. (Time will vary depending on the particular repair.) The other exception is, we offer a rush service, this service is paid at the time of when you drop off the device. This is paid to have the device worked on immediately, otherwise tickets are worked on in the order they are received.\n\n4. Once the repair or diagnosis is completed, we then will email, text, and/or call you, to go over any final or further details.\n\n5. Pick up your device and pay for the repairs. Once a repair is completed you can come by and pick up your device at your convenience. We also offer payment options, you can pay in person with cash or card, or you can pay your invoice through our online portal.\n\n**One quick notes, due to COVID-19, we are not allowing our customers to wait on repairs in the lobby. They must either drop them off, wait in the their car, or outside of the building.\n\nJason, thank you for allowing us to go over this process with you and potential customers that may be reading this. Feel free to reach out to me, Clint Silver, owner at ProTek. I would love to know what happened and would love the opportunity to make it right. Thank you and as always, thanks for choosing ProTek!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I debated leaving this review because I know how harmful bad reviews can be to a small business. Unfortunately, my experience with ProTek was so disappointing I felt obligated to share.\nWhen replacing my screen ProTek compromised the integrity of my water resistant IPhone XS causing it to be hyper sensitive to moisture. This resulted in my phone being corroded by light water exposure only 3days after the iPhone repair. ProTek then refused to refund me the 200$ for the faulty screen replacement which essentially destroyed my 1000$ phone. Let me be clear that my IPhone had been exposed to water on previous occasions to the screen replacement with no issues. ProTek even assured me that there was no water damage prior to the screen replacement. I had expected to have a better experience with ProTek because I had confidence in their customer reviews. Sadly, I have to say I was dissatisfied with their services. At the very least I hope others will take my experience with ProTek into consideration and proceed with caution in regards to ProTek\u2019s remarkable ineptitude with apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589823914117, "text": "I am very disappointed by this review, i'll explain why. Unfortunately for phones, we are in the warmer months and people like to be on the water and when you're on the water, these type of things will happen. I want to start off by saying that we repair and/or recover data from thousands of water damage devices. When you first brought the iPhone in for a screen replacement it was because you left the iPhone in the rain and it ruined the screen. (We informed the customer that the screen was the only thing damaged by the rain.) We replaced the screen and put a new screen seal on it, (as we do with all repairs.) The phone then came back with standing water inside the device, this amount of water is concurrent with other phones we see that have been submerged into water. The customer asked for a warranty on the screen, unfortunately we cannot warranty water or physical damage. (Simply putting a new screen on this iPhone would not resolve the issue, given the current condition.) In a case like this, with standing water inside the device, we would need to let the water dry (we have tools to speed this process up.) After the water has dried, it will leave corrosion behind, which will need to be cleaned. We would then remove the logic board from the iPhone housing, clean it with our Sonic Cleaner, and then test the device for further component damage. We then would replace the components needed to repair the device. More than likely we could have saved this customers phone, had the customer let us complete the water damage assessment on this device.\n\nPlease remember that iPhone's are not water proof, they are water resistant, and each iPhone has its own water resistance rating. We have seen water damage happen in pretty much every way, from being in your pocket and sweating, to being on the bathroom counter while taking a shower, and to drops in the ocean. Each iPhone handles each exposure differently, because in each exposure, the conditions are different. If you are going to be around water, buy a water proof bag, put your phone into the bag and use it from the outside the bag, only to remove it if you need to make a phone call. This will drastically minimize the chance of water damage. I hope this reply has answered any questions as to how we handle water damaged phones here at ProTek. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want some friendly advice, feel free to contact us at your convenience!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

They returned my call promptly, reminded me that they close at 7pm and were not trying to rush me into seeing them the next day, and offered to assess my hard drive w/out charging me.  In about 5 minutes he came back and said it was all there, and then explained the difference between the $150 cost, and the $300 cost.  basically if I wanted 40GB of files in one folder, it was $150.  if I wanted it to look like it did (folder structure) before the crash, it woudl take more time and therefore $300.  Best extra $150 I have ever spent!  They found info from several previous users, which I'm sure my IT dep't will be thrilled with, lol.

From a few feet away, they looked legit, but upon further inspection, they were definitely a counterfeit. I sell plenty of Apple products out of my store on a daily basis and have for 5+ years. I can tell just by the fit/finish, packaging, font, etc that these are definitely not a real Apple product, or even a refurbished unit.\n\nFrom what your customer told me, you reassured her that they were a legitimate product, and refused to offer her a refund, only store credit until she threatened to get mall management and the police involved.\n\nShame on you for preying on elderly and unknowing customers trying to get Christmas gifts for their families. She told me she spent the last $90 of her fixed income to get these for her daughter as a late Christmas gift.\n\nYou are selling items under false pretenses and not disclosing the authenticity of the products. Makes me wonder how many other people you have ripped off with this same scam.

A week or so passed and they called and said the part was in. I took my tablet in for repair they said they may not get to it that day because they were busy... understandable. Well I came back late the next day and they said they still haven't got to it and they would leave a note to do it first thing the next day. Well the next afternoon I called and they still didn't have it ready. So a few more days passed and they called and said they had broken the screen and had to order a whole new screen. Told us we had to wait for the tech to get paid because he had to pay for the new replacement parts. It took more than 1 month to get the new parts and for them to finally call us and say it's ready. We get to the store and ask to pick up the tablet and it is in horrible condition the back panel wasn't even put back on properly and had spots where it was raised up enough I could see the internals on the tablet. We refused to take it that time because it was not repaired. We also learned the the money we origanally paid them to fix it was refunded to the tech who had broken the tablet. The employee/tech refused to try to repair the tablet saying \"I'm not going to try to press that together and break that tablet.\" She was referring the the back panel I mentioned was raised up in places. We told her to contact the manager and she pulled out her cell phone called the manager and said \"These people are refusing to take the tablet and I'm so mad I'm about to just walk out\" the manager told her to tell us she would take a look at it tomorrow. A few days passed they called again and said it was ready so we went to get it and it was better condition but still it is very scuffed up on the trim all the way around the screen and the back is still slightly raised up in a few places. We took it anyway out of pure frustration with the employees and the manager. This place is a joke DO NOT take anything here to be fixed or you will regret it. This is the first time I've ever written a review but this place was so bad I felt like I needed to put it out there that this place is not a professional establishment and they treat their customers like garbage after you hand them your money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459787711858, "text": "Hello Ryan  I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.

I took in my iphone 5s for a cracked screen.  Up front they were very confident stating that it would only take about 45 mins and for a somewhat reasonable price.  The first screen they put on they said was \"glitchy\".  The second screen had screws that were so over-tightened they pushed through to the glass.  The third screen worked but somewhere along the way several other items were damaged.  When first checking in the phone they did a thorough checklist noting that everything worked properly.  Now I have a phone that doesn't have a vibrate function anymore, the earpiece only works sometimes, and it drops calls all of a sudden now.  They told me that they aren't sure what is wrong and they will order a part and maybe that will work.  I told them I didn't want anyone else trying to work on my phone anymore (3 different people already messed up different parts of the phone).  I asked for a refund and was told that if they got approval from the district manager, they might be able to install a broken screen  on my phone and give me my money back.

I took in my iphone 5s for a cracked screen.  Up front they were very confident stating that it would only take about 45 mins and for a somewhat reasonable price.  The first screen they put on they said was \"glitchy\".  The second screen had screws that were so over-tightened they pushed through to the glass.  The third screen worked but somewhere along the way several other items were damaged.  When first checking in the phone they did a thorough checklist noting that everything worked properly.  Now I have a phone that doesn't have a vibrate function anymore, the earpiece only works sometimes, and it drops calls all of a sudden now.  They told me that they aren't sure what is wrong and they will order a part and maybe that will work.  I told them I didn't want anyone else trying to work on my phone anymore (3 different people already messed up different parts of the phone).  I asked for a refund and was told that if they got approval from the district manager, they might be able to install a broken screen  on my phone and give me my money back.

Two days ago I took my iPod 5 in to get the screen replaced on it. The home button still worked on it prior to me dropping it off. Once I got my iPod Touch back with the screen repaired my home button no longer worked. Casey, the owner, claimed it to be a result of the damage that occurred to it prior and I had come to found out that it actually was a result of her improperly removing the button. She tore the conductive ribbon strip from the home button that lets it depress and click the dome switch underneath. She claimed that it was not her fault did not offer any kind of apology and told me it was unfixable.

If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  We took an iPad 3 to iFix on December 20th to have a broken screen replaced.  We called later that evening and went to pick it up after they said it was complete.  We tested the iPad while at the store in front of Tyler, an iFix employee, and the power button wouldn't work, the magnetic closure to put the iPad to sleep wouldn't work, and you couldn't lock/unlock the iPad.  They also scratched the body of the iPad around the edges when they replaced the screen.  Tyler made a note of the issues and agreed we could bring the iPad back for repair after the Christmas holiday.  While we had it, the screen detached from the iPad body.\n\nWe took it back to iFix on or about January 9th.  We had to swipe (erase all content) off the iPad for them to repair it, so we had to buy a new one to replace this one in the interim.  We have received NO communication from anyone with iFix since that time unless we've called for a status.  We have called numerous times to speak with the manager, David and Tyler the original employee dealing with us on this.  Each time it's the same story...they're working on it and since that time, David is no longer with them.  I emailed all of the contacts on the Corporate iFix website and never received a response.  The employee we were dealing with, Tyler, can't tell us anything and he said the district manager was now handling our case.\n\nAmber Wells, the District Manager with iFix, and they would not agree to refund the $196.19 we paid for the screen replacement and she said they can't repair it.  I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint in March and iFix never responded to it.  The leasing manager, Rhonda Clark, at Wiregrass Commons Mall has attempted to get this resolved with the owner but has not been successful.  Apparently there are other customers who have complained to the mall management because iFix won't stand behind their work, lack of work, or whatever you wish to call their shoddy attempt at service.\n\nAt the very minimum, they should have refunded what I paid for the repair.  Unfortunately now, I have no confidence that the iPad will ever work the same even if someone else replaces the screen.  PLEASE don't make the mistake of taking any devices to this store.\n\nAs of September 24, 2014 they STILL have my iPad.  Nearly 9 months later and nothing from them...no attempt at resolution at all.  iFixandrepair has yet to contact me.  Apparently they have no interest in resolving the issue.  I'm taking them to small claims court to try to get this resolved.  Again, I would NOT recommend them for repairs of any sort based on my personal experience and the lack of concern of their staff.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462910926173, "text": "Hello Donna I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.

If he's still employed there, leave.\n\nOctober 31st - Went into the store to trade in two iPhone SE 2020's(currently being paid for with installments) for 2 iPhone 12's(one pro one not). The rep, Devon, was dipping the entire time he helped us. It took longer because he was describing how he had lost another customer's money by entering wrong info into their system, and was making sure he didn't do the same with us. It was busy, so I decided to wait him out. We were offered two options for upgrading the devices:\n\n1 - Pay of the SE 2020's in full for $720-ish and trade them in for a $440 promotional value applied over 24 months towards the new phones.\n\n2 - Trade in the 2020's towards their own outstanding balance, making the payoff balance ~$360, then starting the iPhone 12's fresh.\nI opted for door # 2 as it would be only $160 more over the 2 years, but would be $360 less today.\n\nNov 1st - Devon disagreed I guess and called me letting me know that it wasn't his fault, but I would have to go pay another $360 to his store, BUT IT'S OKAY I'M GETTING THE PROMOTION I DIDN'T ASK FOR. He really stressed, many times, that it wasn't his fault.\n\nI let him know that it wasn't going to fly, and he said he was going to call his boss and call me back in five minutes.\n\nEight hours later, I get a text from Devon: Verbatim \"Hey man I just got a response from my higher up. You can't put it on your bill you will have to go back to the store and pay it\"\n\nI asked for said higher up to give me a call. I guess his definition of \"higher up\" is his customer service trainer. Said trainer started the call with a \"here we go\" long sigh and then told me that they know he's a problem, it was his fault, and I still have to pay $360. I ask what time they open the next day and he tells me they open at 9. They open at 10. I then ask if there is someone competent that will be there. He says someone competent will be there at 10:30. Seems kind of insulting to whoever was there before 10:30.\n\nNov 2nd - The competent employee was indeed competent though. It took 30 minutes of sitting in front of the counter at the store while the competent employee talked to exactly one person and had it fixed. It was painless enough to bring a star back to what is honestly a 0 star experience.\n\nDevon called me a few minutes after I left the store to let me know that he had fixed the problem. I let him know that, no he didn't, competent employee did. He then began stressing that he was calling to let me know so I wouldn't have to go up to the store. As if his good intentions would make up for the error, the lack of effort to fix it, the attempt to put me in contact with people who wouldn't get him in trouble, and finally lying to me trying to take undue credit for fixing a problem that he created.\n\nThey then offered me a discount on a phone case or accessory for my troubles. They were out of what I wanted.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604673288803, "text": "Reviews like yours allow us to improve our customer experience.

It is the same thing as going to a kiosk in a mall to get a phone or change a phone plan.  You won't see this tidbit of information anywhere unless you really look or ask specifically.\n\nThe employees work on commissions and therefore don't have your best interest in mind.  They will peddle the phones and plans with the best kickbacks (go in and ask about an iPhone and see what they say about it; most assuredly they will try to discourage those phones as the commissions are much lower than Samsung/LG etc.)\n\nThe employees also do not put out the correct information.  They twist the truth to try to sell and change your plans.  They updated my account to the Verizon Unlimited data plan from the 16GB plan and when we specifically asked if there would be a speed or service difference, we were told no; it's identical.  OOPS!!  After numerous dropouts and super slow data service, when when on 4G, we called Verizon and was told that the plan we're on is the first to be 'booted' off a tower or throttled due to bandwidth issues.  Fortunately Verizon (the real Verizon) was able to fix our account and put us back to the plan we had where we will get good service again.\n\nLesson learned here.  We will NEVER again go to a non-Verizon store (except Costco, their reps are pretty good) and certainly will not set foot in this store again.  The number of untruths and misleading info makes me regret patronizing this place.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1550170701540, "text": "We appreciate your feedback, .

The atmosphere has become that of a used car lot . The sales Reps work off commission  ,and as soon as they see you are not switching to Direc tv, or whatever else they are selling, they shut down and don\u2019t want to help you. Because of this I have been going to the Apple store to purchase my devices. A few days ago I went into this ATT store to get a new I phone because I needed it ASAP.  I went in to strictly buy an iPhone and nothing else . After declining all the other sales pitches, I pay the sales tax get my receipt and go on my way . The next day I got an email showing the changes to my plan . The sales rep decided she was going to enroll me in the next plan and add insurance to my phone . I didn\u2019t ask for or authorize any of that . She did not mention she was doing it either . This kind of behavior is far past unethical. So the next days I have spent much of my valuable time  calling corporate straightening this out . I have been an Att customer for over 20 years . I no longer have any trust in them .

I would recommend him to anyone that needs a new phone or having any problems with their service.\n\n***************UPDATE**************\nAfter I received my bill, AT&T charged me for an additional line that I did not add. I\u2019ve been to the store twice and have called customer service several times with both saying the other has to remove the line. Customer Service would not let me speak to a supervisor, he took my number and said a supervisor would call me. NO return call! I ask the store to call customer service while I was there and was basically told no they would not do that. I\u2019m going back in the morning again after customer service said again the store needs to correct but if it\u2019s not resolved I\u2019ll be changing to another carrier (after more than 10 years at AT&T).

Safety insured during Pandemic\n\nUpdate: I received my first bill after I bought my iPhone and also an iPad. I was charged for two iPads on my bill and nothing was done about it. The manager could not be found and no one knew exactly when he would be in the store. I had to pay a restock fee of $55.00 after being told that there was no way anyone else in the store could give credit back on the additional iPad that was charged to my account.\n\nInitially  the customer service representative told me that my bill would only increase by $5.00. However, I was charged $60.00 for the iPad on the first bill and $24.97 for another iPad I didn\u2019t even buy!! I had to call 611 in order to get a credit on my bill for the amount that I was lied to about. Also, the customer service representative that sold me the iPad was there and did not take the initiative to apologize for the lack of explanation of the bill. There was insurance placed on the iPad without my knowing. I didn\u2019t notice until I looked at the bottom of the receipt and bill on today!  I will never visit this AT&T again.

Anyway, he went in to get a new flip phone and was told that ATT does not make them anymore. They then sold him a Touch screen phone and he didn't know how to answer or make a call.  I then went online and ordered an ATT flip phone because they do still manufacture them. Dad tried to return the phone a couple days later but came back with the phone. Since I know that his mind works differently now I told him we would go back the following Monday, which we did.  My dad was a little upset feeling like he was lied to when we got there----that did not help for sure. The ATT employee was immediately defensive and disrespectful.  I felt sorry for the young man because I know he'll never get anywhere in life like that. I then decided to speak for my dad and push him out of the way to calm his attitude,  but the employee seemed spiteful and maintained his little smirk. Totally not helpful. There was a level headed employee who came over and explained the phone price vs restock fee.  We ended up keeping the phone due to restocking fee. My advice to ATT is dont forget that Americans still value customer service and a smile. Those two ingredients can bring light into any retail situation.

He then reviewed each phone that we were interested in and matched our needs with the right phone.  He never once attempted to \"over-sell\" us which has never been our experience in the past when purchasing phone equipment.  He then reviewed upgrade discount offers and walked through the data transfer process from old phone to new.  We were in and out in about 45 minutes which is an all time record.

They asked for my social security number to make sure that I didn\u2019t owe att any money. As the man employee was getting me set up the manager came and took over the entire project. As I was sitting there the manager kept asking me if I owned a business and a bunch of other questions. I answered not knowing that they were signing me up for a business account. Through the entire time I was in there the manager never once told me what he was doing. While I was sitting there he started bragging about setting up drug dealers on business accounts as pharmaceutical companies. And how he has done it many times. So a couple weeks pass and I get a bill in the mail for $126 when the manager told me it would only be $65 plus tax. So I called the store to figure out what happened and the manager called me a liar. So I decided to go to the store the next off day I had. Well today I went to the store and the manager refused to deal with me because I refused to wear a mask for medical reasons. Then after me telling him about the medical issues he still made me wear a mask. And didn\u2019t help in anyway to fix any of the problems I had and called me a liar. And he refused to tell me how to get in touch with anyone over him.  And for everyone wanting to do business with this store please wait until they have someone in management that is honest enough to tell you exactly what they are doing with your personal information. If I could give zero stars I would and hopefully they will get someone competent enough to do business the right and legal way!!!
