I had already seen another doctor in that building that I asked questions about how a diet change, supplements, minerals,  and vitamins might be an effective way to help.

He looked at me as a another statistics. Another  Black, older, overweight, uneducated pregnant woman. He didnt look at me as a person. He assumed I would develop all these issues throughout my pregnancy ,seems like he just wants to do a cesarean to get more money.

Such a shame I had to tell my co worker that my experience  was nothing like hers and she was very disappointed and spent the whole day apologizing to me.

My first child was delivered early via c section because of preeclampsia. My doctor with my first pregnancy retired so I decided to try women\u2019s healthcare. I originally was seeing one doctor who told me my baby had a 50% chance of having spinia bifida or some other defect I was also mailed the wrong lab results. Not only that she called and corrected herself and said she was looking at someone else\u2019s results and my baby was fine. I switched over to another doctor at women\u2019s healthcare and today I was made to feel super uncomfortable. They sat outside the room and questioned my motherhood and why I came in/ called so much with blood pressure concerns. I also was told to get undressed because I explained I was having pressure but upon hearing someone say I don\u2019t want to go In there I put my clothes back on a refused. I\u2019ve been having pressure and light bleeding since Sunday and it\u2019s sad I don\u2019t feel comfortable enough to call my doctor or see my doctor. I really hope people learn to show compassion because there is already so many mean people in the world. You never know how much acts of kindness can go a long way especially for someone like me who just buried a relative this past Friday.

There are 3 waiting rooms each almost completely out of sight of the reception desk area.\nI arrived with my older children for my appt to take a pregnancy test. I had been informed over the phone that this was required before I could make my first prenatal appt. I hadn't experienced this with my previous pregnancies but everywhere is different.\nThe reason I was given for this requirement as a lot of women in the past have either lied about/ misread at-home pregnancy test results.\nI arrived before my scheduled appt time, checked in, paid the $11 fee to take required lab test, informed that the practice was completely paperless so I wouldn't be given a checkout slip, asked to come back to the reception area to check out, and told to wait in waiting room 3 until the lab called me to take the pregnancy test.\nI was seated in the waiting room 10 minutes before my appt time. I had one of the first lab appt times available so there were only a couple people in the waiting room. The waiting room is almost directly across to the open ares of the lab. The lab had several nurses/techs waiting around for more patients to arrive. I noticed that everyone who had arrived after me were being called immediately back to the lab. I waited 35 minutes after my scheduled appt time before I went to the front desk to figure out what was happening. When I asked one of the front desk if it was normal for new patients to wait this long just to take a pregnancy test. She was surprised and said the lab must have forgotten I was there. She called back to the lab and told me to go back to the waiting room. I could hear the lab nurse/tech say \"Oh, oops. Yeah, we'll get her in.\"\nI waited another 10 minutes before I was called to back. The nurse/tech asked how my day was going. I told her I was a bit frustrated with waiting so long. She told me that it wasn't the lab's fault as the front desk didn't actually check me in for my appt. The lab had no idea I was even waiting. She said it was also really my fault for not trying to figure out the problem sooner. After using the cup I had been handed, I returned to the lab area to find the nurse/tech. I waited in the lab area for 5 minutes before she returned. 60 mins after my appt time, I was informed that I was pregnant and the at-home test was correct. Everywhere is different and the practice had never seen me before so I kind of understand(given their past history) that I had to prove to them I wasn't lying. She wrote on a piece of paper my last cycle date and calculated due date. She told me to give the test results aka the paper she had just written on to the front desk to check out. So clearly, they aren't completely paperless. When I asked her where the test results actually were on this piece of paper she was confused and said \"that the actual lab results didn't matter as I would be using their prenatal care anyway.\"\nI went to the reception area to check out  and asked if I could get a copy of the paper aka the \"test results\" for myself. I was informed that would be against Federal Law for them to give me any of my test results. Then was told I would need to pay them upfront over double the amount of money I had been told over the phone. When I explained what I had been told by their insurance lady, I was told I was wrong. I asked them to call her which they did after complaining. Long story short, I had the correct info.\nWhen I told them I would be going to another doctor practice. They were confused why I didn't want to continue to use them. They called records so I could get a copy of my test results. I was then informed I couldn't get a copy until it was put in the computer system and signed a general released(I did) and there wasn't a timeframe when they would mail me a copy.\nThis practice was the most unprofessional, rude, disorganized, misinformed practice I have ever gone too.

It was a 5 hour trip there and the whole time I was dreading it. After seeing how I was treated at my local clinic I was afraid I\u2019d be treated the same there. It was NOTHING like I expected. Everyone was very friendly and comforting. They don\u2019t treat you like trash because of why you\u2019re there. Everyone I came into contact with was very warm and made the experience better.

The other staff and nurses were the same. They all felt like they were more than just someone there to do their jobs. They felt like friends. I had to go alone because of circumstances but I felt like I had the best support system ever. Yes, the wait was long but I understand why and won\u2019t complain about it. Throughout my wait they made sure I was okay and never made me feel like an inconvenience to them. When the staff wasn\u2019t doing anything they talked amongst themselves and I could hear them laughing from the waiting area.

I could barely catch my breath, I was stuck on the toilet, vomiting and honestly scared. The pain was so much worse than expected that I thought something was wrong and was worried and considered to call someone to take me to the hospital. I didn\u2019t, I called the on-call number and the doctor told me to just go lie down on a heating pad and try and take a nap and that it would pass. I told her that I was in the worst pain and was struggling to even get my words out to her and that I couldn\u2019t walk for the pain. I was screaming in pain. She said that there was no need to go to an ER that they would just tell me the same thing and by the time I would be seen it would all be over. And I explained to her that I understood that it would be painful but it didn\u2019t feel right and she reiterated the above. I gave up and she could tell I guess I became distant and said that if I was worried enough and after a while if it were still bad and I insisted on being seen to just come to the clinic. I opted out due to how rude she was to me. She made me feel so small and unimportant. It went on for 8 hours in that severity. The heating pad provided no relief . I was taking both Tylenol and ibuprofen alternating safely and there was no relief. I felt everything. It was so bad I vowed I would never do it again. At my checkup the ultrasound was clear. Here I am 3 months later having complications due to retained product of conception. It was an incomplete abortion. I am now going to have to have a D&C. I spent all day in the ER yesterday due to passing large clots, heavy bleeding, and abdominal pain. I am mortified. I am so sad to have to go through another round of this.\nI wish when it was hurting so bad I would have went to the hospital and not have cared about what she said; That there would be a lack of compassion because this was a voluntary termination and I would not be seen as urgent. I tried to tell her over and Over again that I was worried and she basically, professionally told me I was being dramatic in the most condescending way possible. The choice to terminate is still what I feel what was best for me. I wish I would have drove the distance to planned parenthood. Proceed with caution at this clinic. Do your homework.

I noticed a pattern that a lot of reviewers complained of the wait time and I will say that I did have a couple appointments where I waited a little longer to be seen. It really wasn\u2019t that long so it was barely worth mentioning but I figured I would since it seems to be an issue with other patients. But knowing what I know now I understand why. Dr. Voss is amazing. I came in for my pregnancy and ended up being high risk. She explained everything in great detail and what the plan would be for my pregnancy. She even addressed why there may be a longer wait time sometimes, which I didn\u2019t even bring up, but I thought it was nice that she did. It shows that she\u2019s aware of patient concerns and doing what she can about it. They see patients for regular appointments but also unscheduled appointments if there is an issue that isn\u2019t severe enough for the ER but still needs to be addressed quickly. This was me on a couple of occasions. I called in the morning on 3 separate occasions and was seen within a couple of hours due to complications with my pregnancy. So I really appreciate being seen so quickly and will take waiting a little bit longer for scheduled appointments because of it. The entire staff is very friendly and attentive. When things got serious with my pregnancy Dr.Voss was on top of it and I couldn\u2019t have asked for better care. Things could have gone a lot worse for a lot of reasons but her quick action due to her vast knowledge made sure that the outcome was best case scenario. She followed up with me a couple of times after everything to make sure I was doing okay and I really felt like she took her time. She spent a considerable amount of time talking with me about everything, which is not always the case with some doctors. Very often I feel rushed when I am seeing a physician so in the situation I was in it was nice to feel like I had her ear and care. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to come back to Dr. Voss for future pregnancies or any other needs.

As for my Aesetician - we work together as a team we will always work together as a team as that has always created the most beautiful outcomes for our patients.\nDoctors who rush through bruising injections do not create the elaborate beautiful outcomes that I have with Christy - who has achieved the status of master aesthetician- and who spends time understanding the contours and the nuances of need and translating them to me as we work as a team.  This is precise injecting work that I am trained and certified to do - as well as an artistic level of teamwork that I don\u2019t think anyone else achieves especially around this region and therefore anyone who criticizes us has no understanding of what we really do and possibly intends us harm  and ill wishes - which is a very sad (and abysmally low) method of demanding a refund.\n\nWe adhere to the strictest guidelines in hygienic standards and we have some of the most creative combinations of med spa packages that are unlike any around as we are not just any MedSpa but we are gynecologic med spa and we have everything female just for you and more ;)\n\nPlease take some of the negative comments below as encouragement for us to get better especially with our waiting room time -we run into obstetrical emergencies and take immaculate care of our patients and apologize in advance for waiting room misfortunes. We are constantly taking these as constructive criticism for us to get better as negative as they may seem.\n\nHowever I do take exception to one very negative comment below as you will see I believe this person has reflected more of her own self explanatory emotional disabilities than anyone else\u2019s.

I weigh 100lbs.,I was not interested in any of this but, listened. She spent about 20mins or so in the room with me she explained everything in great depth and reassured me questions that I worried about were nothing to be concerned about.

This is my first pregnancy, so as you would imagine, sometimes I have to call and ask questions. I did just that today. I found myself wondering if I should go to the ER or wait it out due to my symptoms. My symptoms were pretty overbearing, but with it being flu season I wanted to call first and ask what I should do. I thought this would be a \u201cgood patient\u201d move. I figured my doctors and nurses would appreciate it. I don\u2019t want to be the one sitting in the ER over something minor, meanwhile there are people with actual issues that need to have the nurse\u2019s and doctor\u2019s attention. And like I said, it\u2019s flu season. It\u2019s no time to be going to a hospital over nothing. But I\u2019m also a worried first time Mom who has experienced several pregnancy losses. I needed to know what to do. When I called, however, I was directed to a nurse under the name of \u201cBrittany\u201d. I tried to ask her what I should do and she was nothing but rude to me. She wasn\u2019t helpful and I never got my answer. She was so rude that it pushed me (who is typically very soft spoken and forgiving) to the point of me yelling at her and telling her to quit being rude to me while I\u2019m just trying to figure out what I should do. This isn\u2019t the first time a nurse as been rude to me from this office, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been the same nurse each time\u2014 but let\u2019s just say each time it has made me more and more uncomfortable with continuing to go to Brookwood. The sad thing is I only have 8 more weeks to go before I deliver. I\u2019ve thought about transferring to Grandview, but with such little time to go, I may just have to suffer through it. But I still don\u2019t think this instance should go without recognition. I don\u2019t feel that expecting mothers should be made to feel anything but welcome and cared about by their physicians and care providers. This includes nurses. I have seen Doctor Batson before and I have nothing but good things to say about her. I\u2019ve only ever had issues with the nurse(s)? but considering it\u2019s a pretty serious offense to be rude to a worried and expecting Mother who is almost in tears due to fear and worry and is just trying to do what\u2019s best for her unborn child\u2014 especially a mother of multiple losses? It\u2019s almost not worth it to go here. Not with Grandview up the road. I feel it\u2019s altogether unacceptable and if I was that nurse\u2019s boss, I\u2019d find her and give her a nice little write up or reprimand her in some way. I wouldn\u2019t put up with nurses making my practice look less professional because they can\u2019t control their little attitudes. It really makes your office look bad when your nurses behave like they don\u2019t care about their patients and are only there for the money. It\u2019s unacceptable. Anyways, I will be reporting this instance, so that something can be done about it. But it just sucks that I have to do this in the first place. I don\u2019t feel that I am out of place in doing so. Treat the women who come to your practice with kindness and fairness. Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t care or that you wouldn\u2019t even spit on them if they were on fire. Moms worry and as human beings we have questions... and if you don\u2019t like that part of your job, then why even have that job? Oh right. Forgot Money was a large contributing factor..

The office was beautiful. That is the only nice thing I have to say. I was referred to see Dr.Short by a friend that works at St. Vincent's. After looking at the reviews I was hesitant but trusted my friend. Heck most places in Cullman dont seem to have ANY great reviews across the board so I was at a loss as to where to even go in the first place, but trusted my friend. Dr. Short may be the best ob/gyn in town but I dont know because I never got to see her. I originally made my appointment in Jan and it was scheduled in February then I had to cancel because my daughter was sick. Well then it was rescheduled for another almost month out. So I've been waiting to see Dr. Short for 2 months now. I got there at 9:50, twenty minutes early for my appointment to fill out new paperwork. I got called back within ten minutes for a blood test, urinalysis, and BP test then sent back out to the lobby where I waited for almost 2 HOURS. I'm usually fine with waiting, but when I finally got called back ,they had called a couple that was pregnant that got there after me , and was being seen before me. Then in the room beside me they were seeing a woman who sounded like she had an infection from a hysterectomy, before me. She was in soooooo much pain and I get it but maybe you should have at least talked to me about it besides leaving me in the dark BUT let me be clear I was there AN HOUR BEFORE HER, and really she should have been at the hospital to begin with. Either way it all started because they didnt let me know that Dr. Short had a complicated surgery earlier that morning until I was called back into the actual room. So I finally was angry enough to where I couldnt wait anymore. I left that office at 12:30 and I am now about to clock in to work. I'm sad because I'm having some infertility issues and was really looking forward to talking to her about it. I will NEVER step foot back in that building.

{"user_id": "105929691657017979850", "name": "Jeny Blaze", "time": 1491319006922, "rating": 1.0, "text": "The worst experience I have ever had with any doctor's office. Period. My very first appointment with this office was at 1:30, so I arrived WITH my paperwork already completed at 1:10pm. The office was extremely busy and there were others waiting hours, just like me. What is the point of an appointment if you're not seen for a 1 hour and 15 minutes later? Just call the patient and tell them you're running late! At 2:45pm, I was finally brought back. I waited in the exam room from 2:45pm to 3:45pm and finally a person came in. At that time, I was extremely upset and cold from being left half naked in a paper gown for an hour. I have unfortunately been through a traumatic experience with a female gynecologist in the past, so was already nervous and worried about seeing a new doctor. After waiting 2 hours and 15 minutes, I was overwhelmed with emotion...\nThe person that entered the room did not introduce herself, so I assumed she was my doctor. Come to find out, she was the assistant, Becky, which I was fine with, but thought my new doctor would be in to give me my exam. She was very nice but threw a lot of information at me in a very short amount of time, and apologized for their new computer system as that was why I waited so long. She ended up scheduling me to come back for some lab work in a couple weeks. Finally, I was able to leave the office by 4:30pm....and all I was there for was a routine exam/checkup.\nI went back for the lab work and really liked the phlebotomist and luckily did not have to wait at all.\nA week later I got a phone call from a girl named Megan who gave me some troubling test results. She gave me little to no information about the diagnosis, nor did they run a test that Becky said they were going to run and I wanted more than any other result. I asked for a copy of my results and she said I had to drive down there to sign something to get them. I asked her to please talk to Becky and see if they did run the specific test as I will gladly come back to sign the paper and have the test run if they couldn't find it in their system...again they apologized for a new computer system.\nI never heard back from their office. No phone call, no mailing, nothing. Meagan was supposed to call me on Monday as our conversation was the Friday before. They obviously do NOT care about their patients and are clearly a patient mill. Get them in, get them out and on to the next. You give me test results that are serious, but never call back, never follow up and have someone unqualified to call you with them. I felt like she had no idea what the results meant and just read them off a paper to me because when I asked questions, I could tell she was not qualified to answer.\nI called their office to find out exactly what I needed to do to get my test results and the girl who answered the phone said I had to come in and sign. To confirm, all I need to do is sign a paper and I can leave with my results? She answered, well no, if we're busy, then we won't have time to pull your chart and make copies. If you need them send to another doctor, we can fax them. I said I will eventually but I want copies for myself too. I told her you're always busy as I waited 3 hours  for my appointment, so I am not driving down there just to have to turn around and drive back there IF you decide to call me to tell me the papers have been copied. She put me on hold and only left me on hold for shockingly a minute and said since they're only labs, I can come down anytime and get them. I am yet to do this so we shall see, but I do not hold any hope that it will be that smooth of a transaction.\nNeedless to say, I do NOT recommend this office to anyone. They're clearly a patient mill, don't care about their patients, don't return calls, have unqualified people give test results and then don't care enough about you to have a nurse or doctor call you back to address concerns and go over treatment plans. They also want to put you on medication for something you don't have. For your sake, do not put yourself through what I went through.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cbc1b99a30e9:0xce5cd6752d72388f"}

She repeats, uhh ok i still don't know.\n\nOnly then was my identity confirmed- i obviously wasn't the correct person. I just had the same 1st name. So i go back to the waiting area and infrom the front desk.\n\nI then get called back to see the gyno. However the nurse has a sheet on me and my \"history\". It says that I had 4 births, that i was 7 years younger, and also of a different race. What???? None were true- I've never even given birth. How that information got on my record when it was the 1st time i had ever been there-i don't know.\n\nThe nurse and the nurse practitioner were nice and that part went well.

So I went somewhere else for my yearly exam this time, hoping for real help. (She was my first gyno visit, I wasn't sure then if this was just how these appointments are.) My new doctor examined me without causing additional pain like Dr.Robinson did, she was so rough during my examination and she acted like I was being oversensitive! She applied so much pressure on my ovaries during the exam that they felt bruised the next day. My new doctor put my fears of birth control pills at ease instead of treating me like I was being over-paranoid and put me on one that made it so I can live normally even during my period! (I can go to the gym during it now!)\n\nUltimately she belittled my concerns, made me feel as though my suffering was my fault (even though I tried to tell her I've been fit before, I've previously been on a track team and swim team simultaneously, back then my periods caused black-out, light-headedness, plus some of my other problems) and then did nothing to resolve a problem that had plagued me for years. I'd recommend going literally anywhere else now that I know that a gyno appointment doesn't have to be like that one was.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1557997457498, "text": "We are so sorry that you were not happy with your care.
