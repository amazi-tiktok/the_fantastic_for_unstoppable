She said, \"not necessarily.\" So I asked, \"but you are ok with me and your other customers doing that?\" After that she simply answered a disingenuous \"I'm sorry\" over and over until I left, with no solutions or answers. Her pretentious and discourteous attitude spoke volumes about the customer service, or lack there of, at the store.\n\nI certainly won't be back, but I encourage others to read the reviews prior to visiting (spoiler alert: mine isn't the only one like this).

When I went to try on stuff, which I was iffy about (covid-19), but I have to try on certain stuff. At first i was the only one in the store for a little while before a second person came in, I asked about the dressing room, girl went in to clean it sanitize which I appreciate. But if I\u2019m about to buy something & I\u2019m trying it on why is the staff asking how long I got in the dressing room she knocked on door more than once , like was there a time limit or something? she kept asking me other people need to try on stuff I\u2019m thinking like it\u2019s about 4 other rooms & then they told me once I go in I can\u2019t go in but once.  With that being said I made sure that I took in all what I could & wanted to purchase. Like don\u2019t rush I\u2019m trying multiple pieces, come out it\u2019s like one person with two other people sitting including a man, which he is not trying on stuff waiting. Manager kept making small comments to staff hardly spoke when I came in....I wanted to give them a piece of my mind but wasn\u2019t worth my time,  hence store was only open about 45 mins when I arrived so I don\u2019t want to hear anything about a long day. Would have never went into store but shop online but I needed something I didn\u2019t want to wait To ship only to arrive with limited selection.

My daughter has never been \"prom dress shopping\", so this was a special event for her. We drove 2+ hours to Elan, and we were greeted as we entered the store. Everything else from that point was terrible. My daughter tried on several gowns and the salesgirl held the train on each dress as I took a photo of my daughter in it - never one time did she ever ask us not to take photos of the gowns. After my daughter had tried on about 4-5 dresses, one of the other salesgirls commented \"we don't really like for y'all to take photos of the tags\", to which I said I was sorry and we stopped taking photos of the tags on the gowns. I was unsure why, but I assume it is because their gowns are marked up well over retail. After my daughter tried on 1-2 more gowns, an older lady walked over to us and very rudely yelled at my daughter if she was taking pictures she would have to delete all of them before leaving the store. She also said \"I know two of my girls have already told you to stop taking pictures\". This is untrue, as the only person who had previously said anything was the salesgirl (not ours) that said not to take photos of the tags. I could see my daughter was very visibly upset, so we said thank you and left the store. They lost my business forever, as well as everyone I know that I can tell about our experience. My daughter commented when we left that she never wants to go prom dress shopping ever again, so I am really upset that these incredibly rude girls have ruined this experience for my daughter.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1614050666769, "text": "This customer was not treated anything but wonderful in our store.

Once a gown is purchased you are more than welcome to take all the photos you would like. This specific customers after being asked twice not to take photos continued to take pictures of Gown tags and photos of gowns. If you plan to purchase a gown in our store there would be no need to take photos of our tags. All of our gowns are priced the same as any other retailer so you will not find it cheaper unless it is a used product. After being asked repeatedly to not take photos and the customer blatantly in front of employees & other customers continuing to not follow store policy she was asked very politely by the store manager to please delete any photos taken in our store as it is against store policy. No one ever raised their voice at this customer nor were they mistreated in any way.  They were kindly asked to follow the store policy like every other customer. This customer then left our store after taking up hours of employees\u2019 time, trying on our product, finding her correct size and went on resale sites posting exactly what size she needed and photos of herself in our merchandise in our store trying to find it at a used price.

I forgot to ask when I was checking out because she'd left for the day heading to the UAB library (I overheard her talking).  I called this morning to get her name but April (who said she was a manager) told me that she couldn't give me her name. The young lady this review is about is  African American and wears her hair in a natural afro type style. This young lady is a determent to your establishment.  Upon me arriving, I walked to the rear to inquire about a restroom.  In a very annoyed tone, she says \"Ma'am is there something I can help you with back there?\"  I walked from the dressing room and said \"I was looking for a bathroom.\" I've visited the NYCO at the Summit and familiar with the bathroom being located near the dressing room.  Very snippy, she said \"our bathroom is not open to the public try The Children's Place\".  I said thank you and she begin to talk very sternly to another customer about a coupon that she could NOT accept.  So I left to head to the Children's place, and returned to hear this lady now talking to another customer about the mis-placement of a blouse/shirt.  I was eavesdropping, but I didn't have to try hard because the cashier has a loud, stern, firm voice and it echoed thru the building.  She pretty much was telling the patron that she would not give her a shirt for a price just because it was located in an area that had a sign for a less expensive cost. The message she conveyed may have been true, but again, her TONE and ATTITUDE were horrible.  The customer left quielty.  But that was not the end of the convo for your cashier.  Two other cashiers were talking in whispered voices with the young lady and they seemed to be trying to calm her down.  In her overly loud voice the cashier (again I think her name is Shelby but I do not recall), this young lady repeatedly yelled \"she doesnt know who I AM!  I could be the regional manager!  I could have really shown her who I was, but I'm trying to be professional.  She and her mother...and she is this, and she is that....\"  I was shopping in your store and there were at least 4 other customers inside the store at the time.  So her tone definitely disturbed our shopping experience. I just needed this to be known because it appears that this young lady thinks that her behavior is appropriate.   I was happy to see her go because I did not want her to check me out at the cash register. I hope the lady she was rude to reports her as well.

I decided to take them back and when I had bought them I payed $15 that was on a gift card and the rest in cash which was $80+. This was already way more money that I was expecting to pay which I also didn\u2019t really have the money to pay that much but I did. So I took them back and got all of the money on gift cards which I didn\u2019t need since the making of the shirts were poor quality. I asked them why this was and all they could say is it was there policy but didn\u2019t tell me anything about it when I payed. I wanted the corporate number but I had already left so I called them and nobody answered it was just a automatic voice.

But those are the only positive things that I can say about my experience.  The sales lady immediately asked what I was looking for and I told her that I would just like to look around for a few minutes if that was ok because this was my first time in the store.  Well, I guess that wasn\u2019t ok because she started asking me all of these questions.  I told her that I wanted to look at a pair of Birkenstock but that I had never had a pair before so I needed help with the sizing and no one in my area carried them and I had driven over an hour to come and look at them.  She immediately tried to get me to look at another name brand and told me she liked them better but I told her that I was there to look at Birkenstock.  I guess I got the wrong idea about this store, since I didn\u2019t know my size I thought maybe they would measure my feet and actually try to help with a size but I left just as about confused as I did when I went in.  She kept changing her mind about what size she thought I needed.  She ended up telling me they didn\u2019t have my size and color in stock which is ok because by this point I probably would have not bought them anyway and I don\u2019t know how she even knew about the size when she kept changing her mind.  She told me that since I had never had Birkenstock before that there was going to be a break in period and that I still needed to look at the other name brand that she was trying to push.  I told her that I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to pay $135 for a pair of shoes without reading up on them and doing a little research and that was exactly what I had done with the Birkenstock that I was interested in.  I wasn\u2019t wanting to spend that kind of money that day just because I had nothing better to do, I knew exactly what I was wanting to look at.  She told me that she didn\u2019t like Birkenstock because they hurt her feet but before I could get out of the store, she told me that she had two pairs that she loved.  What???  And if this was not already bad enough, at one point she left me standing barefoot in the middle of the store next to the Birkenstock display so she could go follow some lady around that was making a return that she had apparently helped a day or two before.  There was another associate that could have helped her.  And my sales lady was walking around with the shoe that I was needing to try on.  Needless to say, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be back and I would much rather shop at the small locally owned stores and with the craziness of the last year, you think they would appreciate your business but this store doesn\u2019t need to count on me to keep them in business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862132dc5e388db:0x4a2c43068782f22b"}

On January 2, about 12:00pm, I went back with the unworn product, in the original box, receipt still in the box, to return the item.  (Note: A time lapse of less than 6 hours as they were closed on the 1st.)\nI was told that I could not return it because it was sale merchandize.\nThe communication of that policy was extremely poor- it is not posted, the sale items are not marked, individually or as a group, and the sales people do not tell you verbally.\nThe only place that policy is communicated is on the sales receipt.  In addition, there are no prices on anything: sale or regular price items.\n\nThe store manager told the sales girl that she would take care of me, asked me to wait while she checked on something.  Returning to take care of me, she informed me that she had checked store records and since I was a regular customer I knew  about the \"no return on sales merchandize\" policy and therefore she could not help me.  (This should give you cause for concern, regular customers are given no preferential treatment.)\nShe offered for me to leave the item with her and said that if I did and walked out, she had no further obligation.\nI continued to try to convince her that I was a new customer and had no idea about the policy.  I asked where it was posted, etc.  Her response was that in the state of Alabama it is \"Buyer Beware\".  I agreed that she could enforce that policy.\n\nI asked if she typically opened the shoe box to read the receipt before she left stores so she could find \"no return\" policies, because that is the only way I could have discovered theirs. (I use the word 'discover' intentionally because this store seems to hide everything: prices, policies...)\nI told her that reputation is important these days with internet data accessibility and that she left me with no alternative but to blog this occurrence.\nThen she wrote me a receipt stating the amount I was owed I could spend in cash with that piece of paper and if I lost it there would be no effort of correction.\n\nAs if all of this, and the fact that I was now required to return, was not bad enough, when I turned to leave she told me that had I behaved differently she could have resolved this another way.  Basically, she did not like me (subjective) so she chose not to return my money.\nTHIS IS A HORRIBLE WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS!!  She just admitted to me that she could have given me what I asked for.  God forbid we do what the customer wants.\nMy thoughts are that their business model is failing.  The only reason to go in this store is to try on the shoes you want to purchase for a fit check and then go and purchase them at a discounted price on the internet.\nThe manager's justification from the other blogs--that it is a service oriented store is untrue.  The sales staff is so immature and inexperienced that they are a bother.  If you ask a price you are told, \"oh it is about...\"  About?  When I am shopping and spending these amounts of money, I want to know the exact price.\nThey seem to have lost sight of the personal aspect of the business and are overly concerned with money.  As an example, did they not think that the sales person (blogged earlier) could also be a customer?  Can they not relate that his experience, and mine, will be publicized for other people's benefit?\nI have never been so poorly treated, ever.\nWhat a shame I have to go back.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1359382495176, "text": "Dear Sophia,\n\nThanks for your feedback. Valley Birkenstock Sole is sorry to hear you are unhappy. We would like to help. Our policy for sale shoes is no return as these are priced for clearance.  Customers are told at the time of\npurchase and it is stated on our receipts that SALE shoe purchases are final.\nNormally we do not return sale shoes as is the policy, but it sounds like our manager accommodated you by giving you a store credit to purchase something else. When you return, if you will identify yourself to one of the owners, we will personally take care of you and make sure any questions or issues you have are addressed.\nValley Birkenstock Sole takes pride in well trained staff who offer full, sit down service.   I am sorry you did not have a pleasant experience in our store and we hope you will return to use your store credit very soon.\n\nBest regards,\nJulie Pierce and Holly McGinness, Owners"}, "gmap_id": "0x8862132dc5e388db:0x4a2c43068782f22b"}

My son said \u201cmom, do you think we can go get Malcolm to help us?\u201d They may not ever see each other again but this guy with the exceptional customer service skills made a LIFELONG impact on my son.

Though I think that having your ears pierced is something of a right of passage that should happen in the pre-teen years, a step closer to becoming a young woman, and she is about half that age, I'm a sucker for my little girl and we decided this would be our event for the day.  I researched online and found a few places that were still offering this service despite this pandemic.  We finally landed on Claire's as it appeals to children in her age group.\n\nAs an added bonus to the day, my niece, who is just a few years older than my daughter, and my teenage nephew got to come with us.  Big Girl's Day and extra help to keep them wrangled.  We entered the store and asked a young woman sweeping the floor near a large unmarked puddle of water how to get started.  Without lifting her head she replied quickly, \u201cyou get in line,\" and stepped past us to keep sweeping.\n\nStill unsure of what to do, my nephew saw the sign situated nearly above the entrance, something that wouldn't have been seen without guidance or turning around to leave.  After waiting in line for about 30 minutes for the 4 customers ahead of us to be seen, another employee asked for my driver's license.  I explained that I only have the temporary PDF version because I recently renewed it, but it is perfectly legal per Alabama Code.\n\n\"We have to have the paper copy,\" she said.\n\nI argued, \"But this is valid.\"\n\n\"I signed a contract for the company that says I have to have a paper copy of your license.\"\n\nI stared, in awe, that she could say that to two excited young girls without even so much as a fake frown, but kept her face as blank and emotionless as Ben Stein's is when he verbally buries an opponent in a trivia competition.  My daughter's eyes welled with tears.  I quickly assured her that this is not a failed evening because I could call someone to bring their license from home and we could still get it done tonight.\n\nWe browsed the thousand's of items for sale while we waited for our help who was only 20 minutes away at most.  The glue-on nails and clearance jewelry was sure to extend the evening's fun.  It was hard to stay focused on the good time, however, when the first woman we spoke with that was sweeping the floors nearly ran into my daughter as she barreled past with a mop, then a few minutes later made a point to put a returned item back on the shelf directly behind my daughters feet, throwing it instead of placing it, and hitting my daughter's ankle.  A simple \"sorry\" may have helped my growing annoyance, but she said absolutely nothing at all.  Nothing.\n\nOnce our help arrived, we cheered together and made our way back to the now empty ear piercing line.  We waited for several minutes, but no one came to help us.  After trying to wave someone down, our hero with the license left us in line to find help.  He was told that they were closing in 10 minutes and needed to mop so they could go home, so they weren't going to do the piercing.\n\nThe look of defeat on my daughter broke my heart and while her cousins comforted her, I placed the souvenir's we intended to buy in addition to the starter earrings on the shelf closest to us and wasn't shy about letting my baby girl know that it's ok, and that because of the uncalled for, horrid way they treated us, we will never shop at a Claire's again, and will make the date a weekend long event by going elsewhere to get it done tomorrow.\n\nI wanted to scream.  What purpose did the nasty attitude and horrendous customer service serve for Clarie's or their employees?  But instead of making my darling feel even worse by causing a scene and publicly scolding those wicked-acting women  like I wanted to, I decided to go the route of public shaming and posting our way-less-than-pleasant experience online for others to take into consideration when choosing the best place to share that memory with their babies.\n\nDon't go to Claire's.  They suck.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da39209e213:0x81182ba20954e921"}

I literally did not see one piece of paper or similar debris on the floor. Shelves were nicely organized with price tags, clearance racks and store personel easy to find. Everyone (employees and customers alike) was wearing their masks and following social distancing guidelines which made the whole experience even more pleasant since I was shopping with several friends including my one year old great niece and a lifelong friend who has an extremely compromised  immune system from struggles with Crohn's disease. Scored a ton of bargains on name brands and designer's fashions. Seriously, I got my great niece a pair of sneakers and a pair of adorable boots for only $2 each. By the way, they were made by none other than the legendary JUICY COUTURE. I would have had to shell out another $45-$65 if I had purchased these designer's labels from elsewhere.  I felt practically criminal after swiping a game carrying case plus a glass screen protector (two separate items) for my son's NINTENDO SWITCH. I paid $5 for both which saved me about $15 and earned me HUGE POINTS with my son. How about this bit of awesomeness: $3 for Beyonce Pulse perfume, 3.4 ounce bottle, normally $15 or more. I also grabbed 2 hoodies for $1 each. And whatever you do, do NOT get me started on the huge savings and discounts I racked up on for the rest of the clothing that I bought as an early birthday present to myself.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPh-JwVbttSU_UDY3q8YvBckEzoQNgc5guW7kR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7oeZ_RbCBJaA1-YmwHkdg9HjN2AU-y4UQKJXK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbTBLhspSL_-iJPSZO2eXwx2CEdats_V7wW_GG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4f323c4b171f:0x8a6f965bf1492cdb"}

My measurements were wrong the first time, so I went back and saw the manager. She measured again and changed everything. When I received my suit for the final fitting, everything was as per the original measurements and too big. They are supposed to overnight my new suit which I'll see 3 days before my wedding.\nIn addition, my son is very small, and I asked for the smallest fit. He received a regular slim fit instead of extreme slim fit which looks baggy. I was told by the person on duty that they don't have extreme slim fit for children (my son is 11, so I'm paying full price for his rental). I don't believe this to be true and will be speaking with the manager soon. I will not recommend them to anyone else. All of my groomsmen and father of the bride are using them, and the father of the bride at a different Men's Warehouse didn't receive his shoes. I can't believe we're paying $200 / person for all of the hiccups during the preparation phase.\n\nEDIT / UPDATE - My new arrival came in a couple of days before my wedding and fit fine.  In the shuffle, the new order had a white shirt instead of ivory and I didn't realize until the day of my wedding that my shirt was ALL wrong!  Luckily Newnan in GA was able to fix me up.  My mom drove over an hour both ways to get me an ivory shirt.\nMeanwhile, I'm waiting on my custom suit.  They were supposed to make up for ALL of this with a \"special\" custom suit, and there's nothing different about the one I am receiving versus any other Joe Custom Suit.  (mind you there were 7-8 in the bridal party who all rented suits from Men's Warehouses across the Southeast who all had some sort of issue).\nI went in yesterday to pick up after my final fitting a week ago, and they had not touched it.  I was told on a Tuesday I could come get it on the weekend.  No calls, no emails, nothing.  So I go in AFTER the weekend and it had not been touched and they said, \"wait 10 minutes and we'll have it ready.\"  NO!  I don't want my custom suit rushed.  I should add that customer service reply 4 months ago gave me a nice discount on my rental, and Kyla and David mean well at this location, but they can't, and shouldn't walk behind all of their employees.\nThis is the worst experience I've ever had with any establishment in the US.

My fiance and I make a special trip again to come pick them up, get there and they have to search for our order and lo and behold....it's not ready. But \"don't worry. It will be ready tomorrow. You can just get it then.\" No we can't because we have to drive for 2 hours and can't just keep doing that on a whim. Not a call, email or anything informing us that the suits weren't ready. I firmly believe they had just stuffed them into the back room and forgotten about them. Strike 3. We have yet to go back to pick up the order because we haven't found the time but I'm waiting for the next mishap. So if you were to ask me, NO do not go to this location. Terrible service. Rude and think they're better.\n\nLet me add: After going the 2nd time to pick the suits up. We had to wait almost 20 minutes for them to locate and 'steam' our suits when we had already called on the way to let them know we were coming to pick them up. Get home with my fiance and he tries everything on, the suit fit good but the shirt was the wrong size and they gave one of my brothers the completely wrong colored vest.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7e4bf:0xbdcc0942cf20358e"}

Better yet, I would assign a negative number if that were an option. If you do not read any further, the takeaway is this: Run don't walk to Jos. A. Bank for tuxedo rentals. I have never encountered such incompetence or ignorance as I have at Men's Wearhouse.\n\nWhere shall I begin. . . If you go to Men's Wearhouse you will be lectured ad nauseum about the importance of everyone in your wedding party providing the group number at the fitting. Great in theory. In reality, we were given the incorrect group number. Thankfully, one of the groomsmen caught the error and provided us the correct number. Yes, let that sink in. No one at Men's Wearhouse was competent enough to provide the number. Don't stress the importance of something and then screw it up. We were, of course, offered no explanation as to why we were given the incorrect number.\n\nMoving on to the next issue. I had a coupon from a bridal magazine that I provided during our initial visit. This coupon was to be applied to each tuxedo rental (14 total). Do you think it was applied? Of course not. It came to our attention when several groomsmen commented on the cost of the tuxedo rentals. Of course, there was no explanation for why the coupon was not applied.\n\nAt this point, it is Thursday morning and we are getting married on Saturday. Have they called to tell my fiancee that his tuxedo is ready? Of course not.\n\nAnd, here's the best part of the story, every time I have called to point out some screw up, the phone is answered \"Hi. This is _____. How can I provide you with world class service today?\" Well, start with doing your job and being competent. But that isn't going to happen. Go to Jos. A. Bank and save yourself the headaches.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7e4bf:0xbdcc0942cf20358e"}

Where do I begin?\n\nI'd give zero stars for this particular location, but 1. you can't give 0 stars on Google Reviews, and 2. we did actually have a good experience renting our wedding tuxes with one of the managers Homer (who is the only competent employee here, so I give a star to Homer. And well, we didn't actually pick up the wedding tuxes at this location, just placed the order, but I'm pretty sure if we did get them from here something would've gone wrong.) but everything else we have tried to do at this store was a complete fail.\n\nMy husband ordered a couple suits and two pairs of pants to get alterations done. They completely wonked up the alterations and made the suit look like a baggy potato sack. We actually did extensive research on how men's suits should fit and the finished product didn't turn out to look anything like the books.\n\nNot only were the alterations terrible but they weren't completed on time. Something about the pants not being shipped on time, but they were smart on their part and gave us a phone call to tell us it wasn't ready when they said it would be.\n\nAfter the messed up all the alterations my husband went back for a second fitting to have them fix the problem. The first suit was completed in a timely manner and turned out exactly how he wanted it to be. They told him to come back the next Saturday and the other suit and two pairs of pants would be done by then.\n\nThis is where things get screwy. The second suit's alterations were completely off, and it seemed like no one had touched them. Pair of pants #1 were even longer and baggier than the pants on the suit, like they definitely were not touched or tailored whatsoever. They were too long by a good 4-5 inches and too baggy in the waist. ON TOP OF ALL THIS PAIR OF PANTS #2 WAS NOT DONE AND NO ONE HAD CALLED OR INFORMED US THEY WERE NOT READY. They said the tailor had left for the day. SO WE HAD DRIVEN AN HOUR TO GO TO THIS STORE TO PICK UP NOTHING BECAUSE ALL THE ALTERATIONS WERE WRONG AND THE ORDER WASN'T EVEN COMPLETED.\n\nIt is very very very clear that some managers in here are not doing their jobs correctly. I came here on a Saturday night - the store was a mess. There were ties and handkerchiefs not hung up, hangers not spaced evenly apart, the phone was ringing of the hook and no one was picking it up, and all the employees were either watching TV and I believe the manager was outside on his cell phone. It is clear that the tailors, or at least one of them doesn't have a brain and is completely incompetent. I understand that these people are most likely overworked or underpaid but it is such a disappointment to receive poor customer service in our economy because there are plenty of people who are more intelligent and harder working that can't find jobs because schmucks like the people at Men's Wearhouse are getting paid to watch TV, talk on their cell phones, and leave work before getting their jobs done.\n\nThis store is a joke and it is pathetic.

As an old retail manager, I found that level of elitism appalling. So the moral of the story is, if you don't care if salespeople are rude, this is the place for you.
