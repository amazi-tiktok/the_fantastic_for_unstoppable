The only downside is that when school starts back, with all the activities and sports, they will probably will not be able to attend as much as they would like.  Simply put, you will not get a ROI for your child.\n\nAgain, I highly recommend the developmental program for young athletes at BlackWatch Sports Performance.  If your child is not training here, they are getting left behind athletically.  But it's not just about being a better athlete however.  They treat my kids like family and work on character as well.

I travel to the Birmingham area for work once a month and was looking for a gym/box that has hours on Sunday.  I had heard some not-so-great things about a few boxes but I hadn't heard of Forge Fitness/ CF Shades.  Not only is CF Shades the only place with Sunday hours, but they were above and beyond wonderfully welcoming when I showed up unannounced during their open gym period.  Upon first glance, the gym was very clean, which is not very common among CrossFit and Crossfit-inspired facilities.  The owner, Rich, jumped up from a staff meeting and gave me a tour and after learning of my CF history, invited me to use any and all of their space as well as invited me back through my duration of stay while in town.  They have an awesome workout space out back with a platform, squat racks and a rig and the running course around the building is super safe.  I also met coaches Caleb, Josh and Rebecca who were all very accommodating and friendly.  When I returned for a class, Rebecca coached and I really appreciated her attentiveness.  I'm a CrossFit coach in Denver and because I move relatively well, I tend to get left alone - but I love being coached when I drop into new places and Rebecca was great.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND travelers and locals to visit.  If you're a member somewhere else in Hometown or Birmingham, switch now.

This is what I will review..\n\nUAB set up a vaccination site at the Hoover Met recently. It is an excellent choice of venue for giving drive-through vaccines. The large parking area is perfect for streaming through cars and lining up cars. It is off any major highway or heavily trafficked roadway. The UAB team have set up several pop-up pavilions wide enough to accommodate cars and UAB team members. The process is very simple and well-organized. I made my appointment through the UAB patient portal website. I noticed that the website made me a second appointment for my second vaccination 3 weeks after my first.  Very convenient. I arrived at my appointment time. There were people out directing traffic in the parking lot. At the first pavillion, a UAB team member gathered my name and appointment time, checked my ID, gave me a short form to fill-in and sign, then directed me to pull to the next pavilion, straight ahead. At the second pavilion, a UAB team member collected the form, gave the vaccination and immunization card and directed me to pull ahead to the waiting area. At the waiting area, a UAB team member greeted me, we conversed and they gave me instructions on how to alert them in case I had an adverse reaction to the shot. They made note of the time I received the vaccination and at what time the 15 minute wait period expired. During my wait, a UAB team member check on me verbally no less than 3x, other UAB team members would give me a nod or ask loudly to a group of cars how we were doing. The wait period flew by and I was on my way. From start to end the entire process took less than 45 minutes, probably around 30 minutes. I didn't time it. Overall, they were as well-organized as any Chick-fil-A drive-through and just as nice. Shout-out to the entire UAB team and any volunteers! Y'all Rocked It Out! Thank you for your hard work! Because y'all cared enough to be there, we are all one-step closer to normal.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcpaZ7F46dAwwJcrJKUoH_CRB6rfPthUYWnJe8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921111e061de1:0xdd0f67408816698e"}
