Answered my messages because she was getting money. About a month later I was moving and had an estate sale. I asked if she would come out and look and make me an offer for everything I had left. She came out. We came to a very reasonable agreement on my part. She basically said my things were not worth what I was asking. Not to a dealer. That\u2019s not what upset me. She has stood me up to come get the stuff. Not answered messages. Just very inconsiderate business practices. Clearly all about herself. I would have totally understood if she didn\u2019t want the stuff which I was basically giving away. This type person doesn\u2019t need business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb3730dc9a337:0xb70d87b3be11d252"}

To top it off they pull from the highest Ebay asking prices and mix them with the the highest sold(which are in pristine condition.) For example, they are selling s yellowed Super Nintendo with one controller and missing cords so it wouldn't work!! sold as is and the sold listings on Ebay for a pristine Nintendo with 2 controllers and a couple games as going for the $100 range. Wost customer service I've experience and by far the worst front of house I've experience. I would be ashamed to run a. business stuffing my face in front of customers and making it seem like it's a hassle to help someone. lady needs to change her or attitude or find a different job. oh yeah..her husband does all the main work so she just rides his coattails. don't shop here unless you want above Ebay prices with no guarantee it's going to work!!! maybe they will see this and respond!

I've got to say that this is the cleanest, best run store I've seen. It looks like you walk into Sears it's so clean and well organized and everyone was in matching vest. I also like the way they did extra discounts while I was shopping, At one point they said anything bought in the next hour was an additional 25% off. I hurried and saved about $16 more. (I was buying light that day) -  long story short I was impressed enough to write a good review. I am very critical of service and deals. This is a place I will come back to. I would definately recomend a trip to Planet Thrift.  - Trey Horton", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890eec86d016dd:0xedf3f8613aa66e9b"}

It's a shame that people have to leave vague negative reviews when we rarely close during our regular posted biz hours. If this person would've contacted us after \"missing\" us the first time we would have done what ever needed to be done to assist this potential customer but odds are they came on a day we are closed (always closed Sunday and monday) or they came after 5pm.
