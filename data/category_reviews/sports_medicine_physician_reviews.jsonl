On Dec 8 2020 Dr. Bonazt entered the room and began talking with the door of the room wide open. I asked if he could close the door while we discussed my injury. His response no because of COVID-19 a violation of my patients rights mind you Dr. Bonazt was not wearing a mask nor gloves so much for concerns. Also, while waiting on him the door was closed the entire time and anyone else that entered closed the door behind them. He ask me what my job title was twice which I\u2019m sure was on my report. He indicated that the fracture was healing pretty good I didn\u2019t need surgery and therefore there was nothing else he could do.

I asked him for copies of the report he denied me of that also, stating that workman\u2019s comp would have to request it. Forgetting when I visit him the first time he did.

I fell on a flight of stairs and badly broke both the radius and the ulna of my forearm, below the wrist. The bones were badly out of place and I was very shocked and freaked out. We walked into the emergency room and it was a serene and quiet atmosphere. They told me I would be put into a room as quickly as possible and it happened very soon. People started tending to me immediately and I was given pain medicine. An x-ray machine was brought to the room so I was able to stay in bed while they did the films. As soon as they had the information from the x-rays, they gave me a \u201cwaking sleep\u201d anesthesia while they moved the bones back into position (called reduction.). I felt nothing during the procedure, thank goodness.  When I woke back up, the pain was gone and my arm had been splinted so that the bones couldn\u2019t move out of place. They put my arm in a sling and started asking me which doctor I would like to use for the surgery. We had no idea and started scrambling for information. We made some calls, and it was a week before anyone could even see us to evaluate.  The doctor who splinted my arm, Dr Herring, strongly suggested the orthopaedist in the building, Dr Stephen Gould. We looked Dr Gould up and he came from Johns Hopkins Hospital, so we thankfully said \u201cYes!\u201d  Dr Herring had been sending all my films and information updates to Dr Gould from the  time I arrived. He was ready to see me that afternoon!  We simply walked down the hall from the room I had been in and I saw Dr Gould after a short wait. My surgery was scheduled in a few days and it happened at Medical West Hospital in Bessemer. There I had another Excellent experience from the UAB Health System!  The bones and incision have healed beautifully and I am sold - I am changing doctors so that I will be using this health system from now on.

It is common courtesy and practice for a pre-scheduled test or scan like that for the staff to have the correct copay available for the patient! Well they did not and on the phone and speaking to whoever was over billing at UAB West the lady got very rude and and said my mom should know what she should have paid~ I have never heard of such and they need to learn how to treat customers, last I check, patients and insurance companies pay their salaries!

He is personable, doesn't forget what is going on with you. He explains all procedures in detail with words and explanations that you understand.\nWith having 3 back surgeries before i was referred by Dr. Lawler from Oxford Alabama. My back kept becoming worse and the pain got to the point I couldnt take it anymore after hurting for about 6 years. Dr. Heck told me that he could help me but i had to have a long and extensive back surgery that was about 5 to 6 hours long. I was ready for anything and I left his office that day confident he would help me.\nDr. Heck came out 3 times during the surgery to speak to my husband to let him know how I was doing, and where he was in the surgery. That meant so much to my husband and me that he had that much consideration not to leave my husband wondering what was going on.\nI came out of surgery that day PAINFREE, after 6 years of constant hurting.  I was Up walking around the hospital floor on the second day feeling like wonder woman, I went home on the 3rd day. I can also walk straight and stand straight. That was a bonus that I didn't know that could be fixed.\nEveryone from the nurse care in recovery, the nurses there on the floor that took the most gentle and sweet care of me. The sweet people that brought your food, the folks that came to your room to get your food order, to the sweet sweet girls that cleaned my room were a joy to be around. GREAT HOSPITAL!!\nBoth of Dr Heck's office staff are great and attentive.  They Call You Right Back, friendly, and they get you right in to see him.\nI can't say enough great things about Dr. Heck and his staff.  Go see him and get your hurting fixed by a Great Doctor!!!

I\u2019ve been having shoulder pain that has been getting progressively worse for the last two month. When I called for an appointment, I was given one two days later.\nCheck in was very simple.\nAnd I waited  about ten minutes from the time I checked in till I time a nurse got me to get xrays in his office. After the xrays I was seen by Dr Greco about ten minutes later. Dr Greco examined me and reviewed my xrays  with me and proceeded to explain quite clearly what my problem was. He outlined treatment options with me. This included injecting my shoulder that they did during this visit. I was a little nervous about the shoulder injection but before I knew it, they were done with minimal discomfort. I\u2019m glad to say that shortly after the injection, the pain was gone in my shoulder. I\u2019m scheduled for some follow up xrays and a return visit.\nDr Greco has made me feel so at ease about my problem and his approach to getting me through this. Although I have been putting off seeing someone about my shoulder pain, I\u2019m so glad I saw Dr Greco today. I\u2019d say on a scale of one to ten, Dr Greco is a fifteen.

When I was called the first time, it was to pay. When I was called the second time, I was led to a second  waiting room with no explanation. The third time I was led to an x-ray room where I found out I was getting x-rays. Surprise! Eventually, I was led to an examination room. No vitals were taken. I waited. Eventually, a doctor - not the one I had the appointment with - showed up and immediately started to discuss scheduling surgery without examination. He discussed two procedures - the second one was news to me. When I inquired, he then tested my range of motion to confirm what he had seen in the tests. I expressed doubts about the second procedure and he left to get the originally-scheduled doctor. After nearly 30 minutes, they both came back. The second (scheduled) doctor explained why he recommended the second procedure as a preemptive option. He did a good job of explaining the surgery and recovery. He left and the first doctor took me to a scheduler. Everyone I interacted with was cordial and professional. I never saw my x-rays nor the MRI I had brought with me. I realize this place is good and they have a lot of people to get to. I known they are all fine surgeons. But still, I felt like one more item to check off on their to-do list.

He asked me the same questions over and over. This is honesty. He asked me my age 3 times and how I broke my tailbone 3 times and what dr ordered my coccyx MRI when all I had already told him 2-4 times there was no MRI of the coccyx only an x-ray.  So he needs to get a little more memory because if not the medical field isn't for him.\n\nBut with all that being said Dr. MELLEMPATI IS THE BEST AND I WILL REFER EVERYONE TO HIM.

I had seen several physicians that could not figure out what was wrong with me. He discovered that I have a very rare neurological disorder. Without his knowledge and expertise, I could have suffered years with this with no help from the medical community.\n\nMy first couple of visits, I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about him. But I grew to really appreciate not only the physician, but the type of man he is. He tried his best to help me with a nerve block. That did not work for me. He could have done a series of them.

The pain I have now is muscular from them being stretched...and I\u2019m using my muscles in different ways. By 6 months I should be 100%. Thank you Dr. Parker for helping me live without that terrible neck pain!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621354deaf35f3:0xc0ae966abc431124"}

Every appointment I have had since I have requested to talk with Dr parker concerning the issues I'm having, not one time has Dr parker seen me! He keeps sending in his water boy \"PA\" who seems to only care about medication i was on leading up to the surgery and told me the pain is due to my brains opiate reseptors are some how affecting my pain tolerance.... I can barely walk right now and its been 8 months. I lost my insurance because I can't go back to work. I'm in a desperate situation and today I was told because I didn't have $150 to pay them to be seen, they wouldn't see me. There are a few things that threw up red flags when first talking to the Dr and high in sight I should of never allowed them to do surgery on me! My quality of life has deminished and I can't even hold my 2 year old son. It seems that Dr parker isn't a stand up person and had no reguard for his patients. I'm going to speak with a lawyer because a Dr who won't even attempt to help out his patient who has been affected by a surgery he preformed should not be practicing medicine!!. I plan on taking this to the medical board, ethics committee or any news outlet that will listen. DO NOT ALLOW DR PARKER TO PREFORM SURGERY ON YOU IF THERE IS A CHANCE IT MAY AFFECT YOUR LIFE FINANCIALLY  IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE DR PARKER ONLY WANTS YOUR MONEY!!  my name is Ryan Hunter and if you have any questions about this review feel free to contact me and i will  further explain this. Always seek a second opinion, I didn't and now I'm paying dearly for it! I'm also reporting him to the BBB and will sit outside his office to let people know just what's gonna happen if times get tough and you need the Dr to fix what he has messed up!! Thanks for nothing Dr Parker! You have completely screwed me over and I promise on everything I love you haven't heard the last of me! On a good note, the young lady at the front right desk in the lobby was very sweet and carring and if not for her I'm sure the police would be escorting me to jail for flipping out on his staff!!

So less than 12 hours of hardware installation ..I was signing paperwork to go Home this wasnt nothing new and I knew the drill..Michael Jordan did superb job as well as well as my Sunday Nurse ..you know who you are ..thank you \u2764. I'm about 9-10 weeks out and I'm thinking the hardware is going to have to come out ...I'm feeling irritation to those muscles  but at least I'm pretty sure that's this problem.but you need to learn where the pain is coming from ..often after the need for the hardware is no longer needed..some folks it doesn't bother ..some I bet dont know it can be removed...(think of where and how your irritation is...you gotta help the Dr. ..talk to him ..he needs to know what you know ) chronic pain ?Take Notes !.some like me know..and while I realize its definitely needed!!
