I saw these reviews, and decided to give him a call, it was a week before memorial day weekend. I can provide all call logs, I told him I have an RV that has a lighting issue that I need checked. Considering I am a first time owner he said it may be a simple fix. I said great when may I drop it by? He said he is backed up and it would really help him out a lot if I could bring it by that Tuesday, I told him that sounds great. He asked that I send him my address and the issues via text before hand. I did. I had to work late and had my cousin drop it off. Please see the photos of our texts. I told him a million times DO NOT BUY ANYTHING for the RV I ONLY want a diagnosis. He took a week, and ended up purchasing: -LP for the RV, Checking the outside, HE BROKE the generator and told me that it stopped working. He even said on audio, it was working when you dropped it off. HE broke the battery disconnect again which was working when I dropped it off. When I went to pick it up he kept repeating how he put me in front of other projects and he needs more time. I explained how he told  me to bring it in on that day because he was behind the previous week. He said well ,.... this that...ect Please see the itemized bill of the charges and work he tried to charge me for that I specifically asked him not to do. I have no doubt he is good at working on more commercial projects,but to try and take advantage of  smaller projects is just not good business.
