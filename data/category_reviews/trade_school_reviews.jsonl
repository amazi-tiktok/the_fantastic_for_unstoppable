I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door.

I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

Then on top of that the higher up people want to say it is important to eat but we have no machines for food , or drinks for our breaks. Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door.

Then on top of that the higher up people want to say it is important to eat but we have no machines for food , or drinks for our breaks. Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door. If we had a fridge or a microwave it would probably cut down on money for everyone and stop students being out of the classroom longer than the scheduled ten minutes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready.

They tried to fix the problem by toning this portion. By toning the hair I no longer had highlights in this portion leaving the hair a reddish dark color on the root in contrast to the blond. They offered to provide additional highlights on another visit but I would still have to pay for the lightener. I was told $13. The next time I came within 7 days to have the lightener done to fix the toned area without highlights. It became apparent the learning leaders only add a small amount of lightener to each extra bowl needed to lighten so they can up charge $13 per bowl. I have noticed this in the past. This time I was charged for 3 bowls. The instructor said these extra bowls were not necessary, however the instructor allowed the student to use this amount. In addition to the bleeding mistake that occurred the previous time without proper supervision, I was disappointed by the poor customer service given by the instructors and poor business strategy taken by charging the customer for a mistake that was done under the lack of care by the learning leader.

We appreciate your honest feedback and you're absolutely right-we are a school! Our students are all at different levels of skill based on several factors including, but not limited to, length of time they have been in the program and the specific areas in which they excel. You may not have known this, but we have a 100% guarantee and you can always let us address any issues you might have had with your service. Students work on guests because they need the hands-on experience which is part of their curriculum. Students aren't ready for the salon until they have completed their program, hours, and have taken both their written and state board exams. They are then ready to transition to an actual salon. We also have students who are in a program here we call Phase 2. These students must pass an interview and hands-on assessment in makeup, cutting, color and texture. These \"master level\" students are available upon request and you'll be getting a more advanced, driven student that is much further along in their program. However, these services do cost a bit more. All that being said, we have to remember that we are a school, first and foremost. We love being able to offer extremely low (much lower than an actual salon) prices for our guests because our students need the hands-on experience. We can all remember the first time we tried to accomplish something...sometimes it was great, but sometimes we also had a lot to learn from the experience. But with practice and patience, we got so much better than when we started and that's exactly how it is for our students. We hate that you weren't happy with your hair, but we do appreciate the time you gave our student in letting them perfect their craft."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

I pushed myself to be better than the day before, my efforts were recognized....and celebrated.\nGenesis Career College changed my life.   I am 4 days away from celebrating the day I started school (August 17, 2010) and the day I clocked out for the last time as a student (August 17, 2011).\nGenesis Career College and the faculty there will give you ALL of the tools you need to be a successful stylist, colorist, or barber....YOU just need to show up and be the success you want to be!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43d16120a55d:0x5f5203343575ff5"}

So, to start, let me explain to you that you do not need to spend this much money on hair school. You don't.  The competitors will ALL help you pass the board, which is the ONLY thing they can promise to do. BUT that is not what this review is about. I made the decision to go to hair school almost a decade ago. I went to Genesis in Daphne, and they said they could tap into my student loans, and I wouldn't have to put anything down.  Sounded amazing to me!  So, I'd say about halfway through, I withdrew, and honestly I can say not because of anything the school did.  I needed a closer location to work it out with a full time job. SO, I withdrew and went somewhere else out of pocket.  I eventually started paying on my student loans and all was grand.  More time went by, and I decided to take a 9 to 5 job with a larger salary.  Then I decided I probably needed a degree to get to the next level.  Well, because I've still got a bit left on my student loans, the university I want to go to needs a copy of all the Genesis Career College transcripts.  Not that anyone can use an \"A\" in \"hair braiding\", but they still need the transcripts. Ok, fine. SO, I spend the better part of 2 weeks trying to get someone on the phone.  I find out pretty quickly in that 2 weeks that Genesis in Daphne closed, and the Mobile location's phone is ALWAYS busy or taken off the hook. At this point, I'd have to say the latter.  I call other locations.  They transfer me to the Mobile location, it's busy.  I finally get smart and start blasting them with phony requests for them to call me because I'm interested in enrolling.  BINGO!  A phone call happens in less than 5 minutes.  I tell the girl that I need to get a copy of my transcripts, and from the daphne location.  She doesn't know how to do that, but \"someone will call me\".  Ok, that never happened. I call back, and email.  Finally, someone does email me. He says that he will send a certified copy and to send the address.  Great. I go online and keep checking and checking, and they haven't received it.  I call up to the Registrar's office.  They explain that it may have been discarded because I'm not actually going to be using those credits.  SO, I email the guy back again.  Again, nothing gets received or updated at the college.  I email the guy again, and again he reassures me that it has been sent, but he'll send it again. This has been going on since OCTOBER. October. So, I call around today, and get someone in Lebanon, TN.  He tells me that he had to get the director to look me up, he has no idea what can be done, what I can do, oh, and that I owe a 3k balance.  NOPE.  Oh, because on top of owing student loans, you still owe the school once you leave, but I was actually able to pay off the school in 2015, finally. He says that he's showing I owe a balance to the school, so I won't be getting transcripts anyway.  So, tonight I spent 4 hours trolling through the last 5 years of my bank statements to prove I paid them in 2015.  All because they aren't organized enough as an organization to provide SEALED records to another institution a previous student is trying to attend. Think about that.  They cannot, as an organization, bring up your records of attendance, classes taken, grades, and put it in an envelope and lick a stamp.  Chris from Lebanon says that this happens ALL the TIME.  My reply was, \"Then it is a systematic issue your organization needs to fix.\"  Basically, the choice to go to Genesis Career College was a blunder of a decision that I still pay for to this day, almost a decade later, in ways I did not ever consider.  So when you're in that sales office planning your financial aid, and thinking about your options, please, consider your exit.  I did not and I regret that I did not fully understand the consequences of using financial aid to go to school for what ended up being a hobby.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43d16120a55d:0x5f5203343575ff5"}
