My husband and I began looking for our home to purchase in August 2017. After we decided on a home and were under contract I contacted Gabe for a quote. My husband and I decided that since we will be moving in a few years it was best to keep our current insurance-- we've never had any issues with them. We closed on our home on Oct 24th 2017. I noticed in November that our homeowners insurance never got paid (the seller paid 1 year at closing). I contacted both my insurance company and our mortgage company. The mortgage company had the incorrect insurance information and the two exchange information. In the meanwhile, Gabe showed up to my home and told my husband that I had contacted him to change insurance companies and had him sign an application--3 weeks AFTER we closed on our home. Now, why would an insurance agent that I contacted be going behind my back and having my husband sign paperwork? My husband trusts what he said and signs the paper, we just wrote it off as just for it was for quotes or something and never thought of it again. A couple of weeks later, I get a letter from our mortgage company stating that we had previously had Alfa insurance and that it was our responsibility to cancel our policy. Now, I never received a single letter from them-- I had no idea what my policy number even was. They had received a check and cashed it WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PERMISSION. I called Veterans United to find out that Gabe took it upon himself to get my PERSONAL loan information from my lender and added Alfa insurance to our loan-- we never signed any kind of paperwork when did this. I called Gabes office-- who could not care less about the issues I was having. The secretaries were VERY disrespectful and nasty. Then Gabe called me and was even worse. He was saying that he had text messages saying I wanted insurance-- which was not true. And said that this was my fault and that I had contacted him and I must have forgotten. I had to take this all the way up to the district manager and it took 2 months and I'm currently waiting on my refund check. Remember how I said the seller paid at closing? Well, that amount was less than what our current insurance is-- and since we've closed there is no way to get the hundreds of dollars difference back from the old seller so we are out this money because of Gabes actions. We never received any kind of apology and they take no responsibility. I would steer clear of Alfa insurance-- especially Gabe Martin.\n\n**** there one only one review of Gabe Martin-- from himself.
