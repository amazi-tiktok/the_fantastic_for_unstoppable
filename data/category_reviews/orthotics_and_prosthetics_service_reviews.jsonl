I complained but he did not care!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595626652691, "text": "I\u2019m sorry for whatever led to this dishonest review. We last saw Meredith in April 2020 when our state was under the \u201cStay At Home\u201d order. At the time, masks were not required but were only recommended. While I did enter the room without a mask, Meredith rudely asked why I didn\u2019t have one. I responded because they were not required; however, if it made her more comfortable I would be happy to wear one. There was no refusal to wear a mask. I would have happily worn one and now do everyday. She replied by saying that it was fine and she didn\u2019t want to argue. I agreed that I wasn\u2019t interested in arguing and only wanted to help with her inserts. After the adjustments of her device were made, I returned into the room where Meredith had apologized for her rudeness. I am shocked to have received notification of this review because she left in such a good mood. During her visit, we had safety measures in place, but masks were not one of them. In April and May, our office had anyone scheduled to notify us via phone once they had arrived. We would call them back via phone when a room was available for them to come in. As the effects of this virus increased, our office began asking everyone to wear masks during there visit. We did not make this mandatory and left the decision up to each individual. However, as of July 16, 2020 the state amended the \u201cSafer At Home\u201d order to require everyone to wear masks. As of now, we do not allow anyone in our office without a mask until this order has expired. Once expired our office will continue wearing masks but only recommend that our customers/patients wear one. We also began checking everyone\u2019s temperature by using an infrared thermometer before signing in to be seen. I\u2019m sorry that you are unhappy with how our business has attempted to operate during this unparalleled time. Hope your feet are happy!\n\nSteven Ford, C.Ped"}, "gmap_id": "0x888918a303322c55:0xbfff2036c7d6d734"}

Mean while I been calling them about receiving said bill and was told they was taking care if it. This was in 2018 now 2019 I get sent to collections called them 4to6 time a and finally got a hold of them. That same person said he never said such. Which was a bold face lie. I have proof. Anyway they said I have to take it to Medicare. Called medicare they deemed it medically not necessary due to documention in which they SHOULD have called my doctor. And didn't. I was told I have to file a late claim due to their neglect to call me all this time. I wore the brace home and never touched it due to its not mine until its paid for. I also explained to Medicare I have had recent surgery on same knee and may need a partial knee replacement but its not medically necessary? 2 years of wasted therapy. So my new doctor did surgery recently and informed my fiance that my knee is a mess. I also fell at home today due to my knee. So I do not recommend this place as far as billing ... To boot I was told Willis the owner wont talk to me about this issue which I do not believe because he is a nice person. He needs to get rid of the billing mgr who lies and doesn't do his job when all he needed to do was call my doctor for documentation to get this taken care of. So I called my doctor office and they said this mgr has not called them once. And they would see what can be done.

It felt like I had a constant itch about a half-inch under the sole of my left foot, and it was so irritating that I had started digging a ball-point pen into the foot where the itch seemed to be to try to stop it!\n\nMichael, the Orthopedics guy, told me what was likely happening was a nerve pinch, and that orthotics would relieve the pressure on the nerve and cause the itching to stop.  I was a little skeptical, but I also was digging into my foot with a pen, so I tried it.  Complete relief in a day!  It was wonderful.\n\nI stand all the time at work, and my orthotics have held up very, very well.  The pictures below are after nearly two years of daily use, and you can see they have only worn heavily at the toe.  I replace them every three years or so.\n\nI had a great experience with Complete Feet, and have recommended them to my friends and my family.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197b567d4c47:0xb3f2189046eef"}

The friendly service is such a plus. Every time I go, Amy helps me decide which styles will work best.\n\nBack when I first got my orthotics  I needed some sandals for them. I was impressed with the wide selection of shoes Complete Feet offers.  Lots of styles, colors and heel variations. My favorite was the Wolky brand sandal with the style name \u201cJewel\u201d. Since that day I have had SO many compliments. (Now I have three pairs of them.). I always tell each woman these sandals can be found at Complete Feet. They are awesome!

She would not listen and just kept saying the same thing over and over....finally she asked if I wanted to talk to someone else, I said yes please and she YELLED great into the phone. The next person I talked to actually listened to my ONE question...answered it and it was no problem. She said give it a week and if we had not heard anything call back. So I called back today. Jennifer answered and checked on the status. Well turns out she sent the forms 3 weeks ago and had not heard from anyone (I would think she would have checked up on it but nope) ....if I wanted to I could call the doctors office myself and request the forms I could....which forms I asked....what we sent them was the answer I got. Does she have the Dr\u2019s number? No but I can look it up. So I do Jennifer \u2018s job for her....turns out she had not sent any forms to the doctor and to top it off that\u2019s not where the forms go. lol  I let the office know what they needed to do (cause ya know I work there lol) let\u2019s see how that goes \ud83d\ude44", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888925d19907ba9b:0x7c02648225091175"}
