We do not field or employ crew technicians to identify the lines, that would be on the utilities themselves, and/or a contract locating company they have hired to come out and actually mark the lines.\n\nAlabama state law does require that the utilities be allowed two working days notice for them to have time to respond to the request, BUT in your case, if you were out of water, whomever notified Alabama 811, should have submitted an emergency locate request, which would have escalated your timeline to get the lines marked.    If you ever run across issues such as this again, please feel free to contact me, and I will be happy to assist.\n\nAdditionally if you would like to call or email me your address, we keep records of all request for a good while, so i can get answers as to whether or not the excavator called it in as an emergency, etc. and provide you some more details.\n\nI do know this is several months past due on a response, but we are going to try and keep a better eye on any requests and review.\n\nMcKay Lyvers\nDamage Prevention Manager\nAlabama 811\n205-731-3207\nmlyvers@al811.com"}, "gmap_id": "0x888904ea6c894b03:0x2fb2abb28f0fddd"}
