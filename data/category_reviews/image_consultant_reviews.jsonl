I'll never have to waste money again after receiving her professional help. We did the entire closet meeting on Zoom, yay for safe virtual styling! She gives you so much helpful information and guidance, and I never felt anxious or overwhelmed. I got so much clarity from my zoom styling session that I am absolutely energized and ready to dress myself well. She gives you much needed confidence. Whats really cool is that she does not just help you then dump you..she actually provides help before the session, follow up information, and will even shop with you. She does so much work behind the scenes for you, and with you.  High quality help for regular people. I can't say enough good things about styling with Laura Showalter.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a1783903017c7:0xf562d20abb2adcbc"}
