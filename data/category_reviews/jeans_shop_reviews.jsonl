The two looked at each other and said sorry because you can go online 24 hours and order we aren\u2019t allowed to hold anything. Now if I\u2019d previously not held something before maybe I\u2019d believe them. One proceeded to say I\u2019ll put it in the fitting room and we can just say she\u2019s waiting on the fitting room!! Which means YOUR HOLDING IT. I smiled and told them that was ok and walked out needless to say I will only order from online or if I see the manager ( can\u2019t remeber her name but she\u2019s awesome) I\u2019ll only shop then.

At first i was the only one in the store for a little while before a second person came in, I asked about the dressing room, girl went in to clean it sanitize which I appreciate. But if I\u2019m about to buy something & I\u2019m trying it on why is the staff asking how long I got in the dressing room she knocked on door more than once , like was there a time limit or something? she kept asking me other people need to try on stuff I\u2019m thinking like it\u2019s about 4 other rooms & then they told me once I go in I can\u2019t go in but once.  With that being said I made sure that I took in all what I could & wanted to purchase. Like don\u2019t rush I\u2019m trying multiple pieces, come out it\u2019s like one person with two other people sitting including a man, which he is not trying on stuff waiting. Manager kept making small comments to staff hardly spoke when I came in....I wanted to give them a piece of my mind but wasn\u2019t worth my time,  hence store was only open about 45 mins when I arrived so I don\u2019t want to hear anything about a long day. Would have never went into store but shop online but I needed something I didn\u2019t want to wait To ship only to arrive with limited selection.

Prices were good but the sales clerks never spoke to us. I watched while my wife was looking at clothing.  She was wearing shorts and a tee-shirt because it's easier to try on clothes. She was completely ignored. The salespeople greeted and engaged in conversation every lady who was dressed up or seemed to be known to them to help them find things. My wife was looking for a particular item and they were no help. Even after my wife approached one of the sales clerks she didn't offer to help. They even ignored an elderly lady in a wheelchair. As an old retail manager, I found that level of elitism appalling. So the moral of the story is, if you don't care if salespeople are rude, this is the place for you. But if you need help finding something or you want to be treated courteously, then stay away from this place.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888912bf5712a2bd:0xa3275361458acdf0"}
