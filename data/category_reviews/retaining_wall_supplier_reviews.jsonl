I will say that I mostly come to this store after 5pm usually.\n\nI thought it was important to let you know this because if things do not improve, I will just go across the street to Lowe's where they have always been more than happy to help me.  Your store is my neighborhood store, and I want to see you succeed and not go under because of poor management decisions with either hiring bad employees or not paying your staff enough to care about the customers.\n\nThanks!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb241be931b75:0x8af03cb47b176b35"}
