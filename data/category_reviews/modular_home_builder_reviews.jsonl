After more than a year of trying to get started with building a safe place for us to live we\u2019re forced to move on. We are both over 70 and sick. Our home is more than one hundred years old so utilities and maintenance are very high. We went through winter using space heaters. When we turned the air conditioner on it caught fire after just two days of use!  Mobility issues mean we could not get out quickly in an emergency but they won\u2019t even return calls or discuss the refunding of our money. They are dishonest and heartless so please don\u2019t follow my lead. Do not trust these people to do what they say!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bcb911ca32803:0x90635852b432bef"}
