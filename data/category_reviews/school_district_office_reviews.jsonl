We always hear about how education is important, but that isn't what matters to this system. It's numbers. Students take between 10 and 20 standardized tests a year and are only seen as a way to give our schools a good reputation. Recently, Mountain Gap school has decided to take away all fun activities and free time during the day so students can study for the scantron test so the school has better numbers. Speaking of Mountain Gap, this school needs fixing. Why are we building new schools no one has to have instead of fixing up older schools. As one of the oldest schools here, Mountain Gap offers good education but terrible conditions. There are mice and cockroaches, and the heating/AC system is so outdated. When it was 75 degrees outside, the heat was still on. We had to suffer through a sweltering heat at almost 85 degrees. This school system needs to get its act together.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886214ac533bf3cf:0xbced1170130a5d81"}

Of the ten candidates who applied, the least qualified when looking at experience and degree rank is the one the Board hired.\n\nBy the way, the Board president needs to save the tears for somewhere else as she has proven herself not to care at all about doing things the right way.\nAnd, that fool who sits next to her needs to get off the Meds. She congratulated the new superintendent by stating \u201cOhhhh, I\u2019m so glad we did it this way tonight. You and I go way back to our glory days at Blossomwood. Our kids have grown up together.\u201d\nNow, there are some qualifications and reasons to hire a superintendent who basically said nothing the entire evening.\n\nLastly, I give this Board 1STAR but I give Pam Hill 5 STARS. She is the only one of the 5 Board members that took a look at what was going on and said, \u201cStop. You are not wasting my time or the other candidates time by going through some dog and pony interview. You three already know who you want. It\u2019s a done deal. But, let me tell you this, it is sad. Sad for our kids, teachers, parents. They trust us to do things honorablly and above-Board. We failed them tonight.\u201d\n\nSo, congratulations to the three stooges! You have ruined our once proud school system, have established a history of not following the laws that are there for you three to follow, and then you have the audacity to try to get Sally \u201csomebody\u201d to censor Pam Hill because why?\nI tell you why.....Because, Pam is telling the truth.\nIt\u2019s about time you learn that skill or resign.\n\n-Seymour", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886214ac533bf3cf:0xbced1170130a5d81"}
