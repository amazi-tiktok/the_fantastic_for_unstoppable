The drive through was closed today so I entered the store (not wanted to go inside trying to keep my husband as well as I can) the cashier, when I asked,  told me the pharmacy  was closed I asked to speak with the manager. The shift manager  can out and I asked him why the pharmacy  was closed he said someone  in the pharmacy tested positive  for COVID-19.  I told him I must have my husband's  prescription because  he could end up in the hospital  without it. His answer  was that he didn't  know when the pharmacy  would open back up and they were having the store cleaned  tonight by a professional cleaning  co. So what is a person to do if they depend  on a medication that they have a prescription for and can't  get it from the co. they have trusted to fill that prescription? The shift manager at 4:10 PM Tuesday  answer  was to call the doctor and get a new prescription sent to another store. I guess he doesn't  realize how difficult  it is to get intouch  with a doctor and a doctor at that time of day. Wouldn't  you think that the owner of this pathetic excuse  for a pharmacy would have had an emergency  plan in plan? We have been dealing with this Virus  for many months and a company this large should have a disaster plan in plan for just this type  of scenario. Pathetic. Everyone of my friends  has had a horrible  experience  with this store. We are going to flood the social media sources and expose  this company for who they are. They care nothing about the people  that keep them in business it's  all about money to this owner. Would you not think that they would close the whole store if someone  tested positive for COVID-19 I mean do they think that the virus decides to stay in one area of the store. Do they think that people  don't  go in there and touch products  before they go to the pharmacy. Just an example the bottom  line is money not care. Even Sonic  hamburger restaurant in Leeds Al. closed completely when one of it's employees tested positive and they sell burgers. The Walgreens in Leeds Al. Is absolutely  the worst pharmacy  in Leeds. You would think if they cared they would have had a disaster plan in place and they could have contacted all patrons that have life sustaining medications of the situation and where they could pick up their medication. There are many other drug stores  in Leeds and the surrounding area. I encourage  everyone who has had a dangerous experience with this co.to stop using  them and contact the head office. Good luck finding a competent person that works with this co.

I have been a loyal Walgreens customer for at least 20 years, and have used Walgreens on the east coast, the west coast, and in between.  I\u2019ve never had any issues with any other Walgreens as I have at this store.\n\nTo begin with, I\u2019ve experienced phone wait times for up to an hour.  I just gave up on calling\u2026I go directly to the pharmacy and wait to speak to the pharmacist.  I take a lot of meds, and there are times I have to personally request the pharmacy to fill certain prescriptions, as Walgreens online won\u2019t allow me to electronically file certain scripts. Luckily I\u2019m not far from the pharmacy, and driving over is no big deal for me. If you need to talk to someone in the pharmacy, just save yourself the frustration of calling.\n\nI used to be a Job Coach, so I didn\u2019t just want to hate this pharmacy\u2026I wanted to understand what the problem was (is).  The problem is, they are always extremely busy, and maybe understaffed.  There have been times I have visited the store when there were at least 15 cars in line for the pharmacy; the line being wrapped around the building.  In addition there were also times where there were up to 10 people in line at the pharmacy.   I\u2019ve sat and watched the employees working, and they are all working like crazy.  Nobody is on their phones, no one is standing around talking\u2026they all seem to be working just as hard as they can.  In addition, I\u2019ve always been treated with the level of kindness and professionalism that made me a loyal Walgreens customer many years ago. When I\u2019ve been there I\u2019ve heard the phone ringing constantly.  But In the pharmacy employees\u2019 defense\u2026they are so overwhelmed with customers in the store, no one has time to answer the phones.\n\nWalgreens, if this pharmacy is understaffed, help them find some more employees!  There are a ton of people who depend upon this pharmacy for their medications.  Help this pharmacy to be better!\n\nSincerely, an extremely loyal Walgreens customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccea8b57332c1:0xcebb8fff287cdf42"}

I watched them tell a customer in the drive through to hold while they pulled her RX only to stand and talk more.\nComing from surgery I was told that the wait for my RX it would be 2 hours minimum. We all know there is NO 2 hour wait for a \u201cwaiter\u201d as Cvs calls them. I\u2019ve never called this particular location and not been placed on hold less than 10 minutes. I now know why. CVS does not seem to care about the quality service they give like they once did. They do not appear to be understaffed, they appear to have a lazy work ethic and VERY poor bedside manner.

She then informed me that I could go to and I quote \"Mom and Pop\" drug store and they would be able to help me with the 2 needles that I need. I said my prescription card is CVS caremark and you send me mail telling me if I shop anywhere else but you, that the prices will be higher because I'm not using you and yet you sell me medicine I can not use because you have no needles. She said covid vaccine is our top priority right now. I said wow I thought the customer would be your top priority. She said you obviously dont understand the importance of this. I informed her I do. I'm a healthcare worker but what I dont understand is I've been asking for these needles long before a vaccine came out. How do you sell me medicine but no means to administer it. Is that what you tell people with their insulin. I'm changing our pharmacy to another pharmacy (NON CVS and NON Walgreens). Preferably one that is more willing to help me and my healthcare needs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892925879a56619:0xdac8647b32697937"}

One of the technicians here stole half of my prescriptions. Now, I'm from out of town and this was my first and last time using this Walgreens. I went on a Thursday evening, and dropped off my prescriptions, then I went out to dinner. Afterwards I came back to Walgreens, there was a brunette at the register who was rude. I thought, she must be tired because she didn't look too good. I paid for my medication and walked out of the pharmacy. I went back to my place and noticed half the prescription was missing! I thought that's strange half my medication is missing and I just left the pharmacy that's never happened before, so I assumed it was probably a mistake.  When I finally got in contact with the pharmacy, I explained what happened and a woman responded saying she needed to check their records. After a few seconds she comes back on the line to tell me their counts for the prescriptions were accurate and she couldn't do anything about it. I said, I will come up there with the prescription bottles to discuss this! Then she proceeds to tell me she's the Pharmacy's Manager. At this point, I was getting upset! I told her this pharmacy charged me FULL price for a months supply of prescriptions then only gave me half of it. I told her, I had to pay out of pocket for this and I want to be reimbursed.  She continued to say there's nothing she could do.  Well, that's just too bad, because for a \"Manager\" not to even attempt to investigate  problems when a customer is genuinely upset and telling the truth about a bad experience just baffles me. Why isn't this manager more concerned that a technician took someone elses medicine from the pharmacy's safe and then falsifed records to get away with it?! She's kept saying there's nothing she could do. Really?! Why don't you fire the employee, so this doesn't happen again. Stealing medicine is illegal, but it's ok I know EXACTLY what to do and I will be making a police report about that employee and this Pharmacy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81d18b851a71:0xd03d4b2140601f19"}

I take one prescription a month which is a schedule three or four narcotic I believe. I go to my doctor and he writes my new prescription every 28 days. I take two a day which equals 56. I drive almost two hours to this doctor and live in a rural area that never has this medicine so I always stop at this Walgreens and every time they tell me they can\u2019t fill it until the next day or I have to wait two days even tho my doctor schedules my next appointment on the exact day my medicine runs out. For example I got my prescription filled there last month on 2/5/20. Went yesterday after my appointment to fill my script for this month which ran out yesterday. Waited in traffic and in line for over 20 minutes only for the cashier to tell me she can\u2019t fill it until tommorow. I didn\u2019t even waste my time explaining to her that I couldn\u2019t turn around and drive two more hours again the next day or that my medicine ran out yesterday so technically I could have gotten it filled two days early as per the narcotic laws. I\u2019m not sure if she dosent pay attention to the quantity and counts thirty days or she just dosent care to actually read the directions on the prescription. This is also a medicine that if I don\u2019t take it causes extreme withdrawals so I ended up having to drive 30 plus miles out of my way and wait two to three days for another pharmacy to fill it. Got home and called and asked them via the phone if I was eligible to get it filled yesterday and the lady said yes. Needless to say these people don\u2019t understand that some of these medicines are people\u2019s lifeline and they don\u2019t understand the danger and inconvenience of having to drive all around the country and risk your health all because they can\u2019t take twenty seconds to read a prescription look up last day it was filled and count 28 days. Drove 30 miles to another pharmacy keep in mind another WALGREENS pharmacy and they told me I could have gotten it filled Sunday. Done with Taylor road.

This process has tried to take place every day for the past three days and I am finally giving up. The first day it took me 10 minutes before I could talk to anyone and when they finally answered they said their phones are down. That in itself was sketchy because I was talking to them through their phone system, but I figured that they got something working. I gave them my information and they said that they would get that in and text me from their personal phones (that in itself is odd) when it was ready. I never got that text. The next day, around the same time, I went down to the store to pick up school supplies and I asked them about my prescriptions. They had to take my information again as their phones were down and their computers were acting up the day before and they didn't get to my order. They asked me when I needed it and I said the next day and they told me they would call it in right then.

I'd come here more often if they did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e09e8e8a8103:0x2237f94548c29dba"}

When we first decided to file a complaint with management at this location we never heard anything back from the store owner Belinda McCulley. When we finally made contact with her one month after leaving numerous voicemails and she outright told us we were to blame for the malfunction of their piercing gun because I didn't hold my 3 month old child's head still while Marty, the store clerk performed the service. I am HIGHLY disappointed by the lack of customer service and outright non-caring attitude I received from Mrs. McCulley. How can she say that we, the customers, are to blame for something she didn't even witness, and then dismiss it as if it never even happened. The Outcome:  We were charged the additional $50 for a second set of $15 CZ earrings and they have no intention of returning our money.  In short, I would never treat one of my customers in this manner and therefore will not recommend this store or their services to any friends or family members. You might as well allow a 15 year old kid at the mall to pierce your childs ears, you will get better customer service....  not to mention save yourself a few dollars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f8e5fc55d1:0x3754cbb9a7217873"}

This location has to be the most dirty Ulta that I have ever been in. ALL testers were filthy and not wiped down, the inside and outside of the pallets are just nasty smashed ,crushed and messed over. The outside of the pallets have all kinds of mess on them obviously they dont maintain them. Also a lot of the pallets were not even properly attached to the display  barley touching it it fell off... touch the pallet next to it.. they both fall off.. especially in the Tart cosmetics section it was a mess. All of the lip sticks were smashed and running down the jar it did not look sanitary or properly maintained. If you did take a sample or a swotch of a color there were no wipes to clean your hands ex.. the clean up sections were not properly stocked. The isles were unorganized and had products on the floor in the hair care area. Make up storage boxed that are $60 + strung out on the floor with brushes and what not. The entire time I was in the store not one employee greeted or asked if I needed help finding anything they were very unwelcoming and uninviting and had a dont bother me vibe.  I will not be returning to this location of Ulta beauty.  I go to the location in River chase and theres is perfect friendly, clean and welcoming so I know what to expect from the franchise.  Midtown village location is not hitting the mark. Also the store needs a good airing out because the perfume testing smells were so over powering it hit me like a truck the second I entered the store. It was distracting and over whelming how it felt stuffy as if there is no air circulation in the store and smelled of stale perfume samples all mixed together with thick air. Which the other Ulta locations I have visited do not have this problem. The store did  not have a clean sleek environment that Ulta is known for. Non of the products were properly fronted on the shelf for easy and clear access. I had to keep checking to make sure the correct pallet was sitting in the proper spot and most of the time they were not. Everything was jumbled around not in its proper place not properly fronted for easy viewing. At the end of it all the store was such a mess I just left.

After ringing up I was informed that a prescription had raised from a $0 co-pay to $100. This came as a big shock and my mind was wheeling with trying to figure out how to afford that each month. The staff at the pharmacy informed me to call my insurance and make sure something was not incorrect and were very patient while I did so. This was all happening at the end of their shift. The new co-pay was the correct amount and luckily my family was able to help cover the cost. Fast forward to a few days later and I received a phone call from Walgreens patient care. The pharmacy staff had contacted them on my behalf to enroll me in to a co-pay assistance program through the medication manufacture. The new total monthly cost would be $20!

When I went to the store and scanned my card, the only thing that came up was a completely DIFFERENT foundation that I have never even owed. This Fenty foundation was the first thing I have purchased from this location in years so I knew for a fact that I didn\u2019t buy it and just forgot. It also showed that I \u201cbought\u201d this right around the time when I actually got the Fenty foundation. The cashier rang up the wrong item when she checked it out now I am unable to make any returns or exchanges with this item and was basically told there\u2019s nothing they could do because it\u2019s not the product that\u2019s on the receipt.

My daughter finally suggested swatching my old one (which I had with me, although broken) on my wrist and then the new KatVonDee's to see which was the closest. That worked and I made the exchange.

I AM NOT PREJUDICE but I want to ID exactly who treated me so poorly in the event there are other employees working there so they will not be identified by this review. 1st, I have Systemic Lupus and in very bad health. Most of my hair is almost gone (Alopecia Areata) but I have a resource for a $500.00 scholarship to fund for a natural hair wig or Cranial prosthesis.  The Asian man told me RELUCTANTLY that if I bought a wig cap that I could try on up to 4 wigs. Then because I didn't find a real hair one that suited me, I asked to try synthetic ones in style and color of my  desirous purchase  (all of which could be made to order) he refused to allow me to try on ANYTHING and I was told that this is not for browsing but for purchasers only. I had my daughter with me with a 7g credit card and could have spent every cent IF I CHOSE but was not allowed to even touch. I wasn't even ashamed of how I was treated for myself but for him, I was appalled. We were clean, decently dressed and sincerely interested in several products. I  knew my long hair looked shabby and was getting it cut the next day so it was really important to have access to anything to help with the natural grief anyone who loses all their lashes, brows, scalp hair etc. experiences. Vanity? Yes, but the way we were treated was unconscionable.  Skin care is an issue so no makeup but no rashes or anything to contaminate his inventory. He simply judged by my appearance and all but ushered us out the door. I may be weak physically, I may be unwell, but I, nor ANYONE ELSE deserves to be treated so very unprofessional and unkindly. God help this man and I pray he is never on the other side of this ENCOUNTER.  SHAME ON YOU.  SHAME ON YOU!

I have had just a few minor negative experiences during this time. Most of the time I was comfortable with the service. Today was a different story. I called about an hour before they closed to finalize 2 scrip. orders. I called at this time because I had tried several times in the past week and today to get thru to someone on the phone, but had too long of a hold time each time. I thought it might be less busy at 7pm. The woman who answered, who I believe was the pharmacist on duty, had a disrespectful tone a couple of times during the call. I mentally excused her then drove to pick up my orders almost immediately. When I arrived the assistant, who was one of the distasteful encounters I've witnessed in the past, was working the drive thru. I told her I needed the pills cut in the required dose which I'd gotten done many times before without problems. It usually doesn't take very long to do as well. I went to wait across the lot when I saw a multitude of cars arriving at the drive thru right before closing time. 15 or so minutes had elapsed and it was closing time by that time so I decided to drive back over to the window to pick up my meds. When I arrived the tech ignored me for about a minute or 2 and then she mouthed something to me without the microphone and immediately walked away out of my sight. I could not make out what she said, of course. I continued to wait patiently. Within that time the pharmacist walked over and in a scolding tone told me to tell her ahead of time I needed them cut. I informed her I did not because I was informed in the past not to do that because I must pay for them before they are cut. She then continued her scolding by telling me \"Well it's just so late.\" Omg...are you not still open for business when I arrived 15 to 20 minutes prior? And it doesn't take that long to cut them. And I would of done it sooner if I could of gotten someone on the telephone without a long hold time every time I called! That response was rude, unprofessional and unfair and I did nothing wrong. How dare her and that tech or whatever she is treat a good customer this way. I have always been fair and courteous to the staff.

I told her I was leaving to go to Florida at 9am the next day. I then asked \"why is it taking so long after you ordered it to come in? She said it's because it's a narcotic. So I went on to Florida.

Mr. Witten  was rude from the start. When I explained about the return he cut me off with a terse \"calm down.\"  Had he let me finish he would have known that I wanted to see if they carried the actual item I wanted and I could do an exchange. However, I never got that far because Joe followed up with more mature declarations of  \"it's not my fault you got the wrong thing\" and \"I didn't do it\". So now I am just looking  wide-eyed and gape-mouthed at this pudgy man getting all worked up over a return for SKIN MOISTURIZER.  Mind you,  the item was unopened, still in the original packaging, with the receipt and was within the return period and this guy is giving off all kinds of micro-aggressive vibes like I have done something wrong. I felt super uncomfortable as the store was full of people who could all hear this man lose his composure over a return.  He asks for my driver's license TWICE  which I understand if a receipt is not present but again, I had a valid receipt. When he  finally gets around to processing the return Joe gives me a CVS Gift card and tells me it's a money card. I have never returned anything to CVS before so when I ask him how to use it he admits that it can only be redeemed at CVS.  I point blank ask him why he didn't process the refund per the original method of payment  (my bank card) he smirks at me and says \"alright, alright, I said I would take care of it.\"  He then processes the return to my card but botches the transaction and ends up having to give me a partial cash refund.\nI will NEVER, EVER, EVER  go to CVS again! It is my opinion that Mr. Witten  needs to be terminated  but at the very least he needs some time away from that store to undergo re-training. As long as he is employed with the organization they will not get one dime of my money.

Tonight was just the most recent incident.  In spite of having 8+ years history of purchasing insulin and supplies in the computer, due to not having an active Rx (we can't have an active Rx at every pharmacy in town \"just in case\" our insurance-dictated regular pharmacy is not accessible at that moment of need), the pharmacy tech gets to decide, based on personal bias/mood, not to sell the only safe method of delivery of insulin (which is now prohibitively expensive without insurance) to a type-1 diabetic who has a documented history of his need for that medicine.  Diabetes does not go away! Once insulin dependent, always insulin dependent!  A pharmacy tech just decided she wants a customer to either use dirty needles (infection risk, tissue damage, increased pain to use) or go without insulin and let his blood slowly turn to poison and kill him.

When I was called back to pay one of the meds was almost 50 dollars than the coupon rate. When I questioned the price the Pharmacy Tech rolled her eyes and started popping her gum in my face. The Pharmacist then said I told him I had the coupon but did not give a card, Good RX is an app, so i didn't get the discount. So i showed the tech the coupons and she told me she didn't need them she could just do it herself. She told me that it would be another 10 minutes and when I questioned why such a long time to change the price they refused to fill the medicine and returned my paper prescriptions. I asked to speak to the store manager and was informed by the Tech that he was not there so at this point all i could do is leave.\n\nOnce home called back to the store to get the pharmacist and technicians names and licences number. Well the store manager answered the phone. He then preceeded to tell me that he could not give that information until I told him that it was a matter of public record and that if it was not posted in plain view that they were committing a crime. So when he finally gave me the pharmacist's name , Charlie, i filed a complaint with CVS and the state pharmacy board.\n\nAlso I called around to 2 other CVS stores to check cash prices and found out that he was going to charge me more than the other stores.\n\nIt is no wonder that BCBS of Alabama will no longer deal with CVS.\n\nI would avoid doing this store at all costs in the future.

The person working the counter was helpful and apologetic, but when the Pharmacist came back, she said \"we don't manufacture the pills, so it's not out fault\".  She obviously missed the training for customer service.  This was the fourth time I was told the prescription would be filled and it still wasn't done.

It's a pharmacy, first and foremost in the business to take care of a patient's needs by filling doctor prescribed medication for sick people. That alone should mean the employees will be kind, considerate, and have the patient's best interest at heart, which requires a certain level of customer service skills. I can honestly say, this is by far the WORST customer service experience I've ever had, in ANY industry! From the pharmacist herself to the tech working the counter, they are the rudest people I've encountered! My particular issue began with a refill which I called in back in August. Once I received a text that it was ready for pickup, I drove over to collect it, only to be told once I got there that the RX was not ready and the drug was not in stock. The tech argued with me about being notified that it was ready until I showed her the text message and then she had nothing to say. I was then told they would call me when the drug was back in stock and my RX had been filled. Three weeks went by and no word so I drove back over to check on it. This time, I spoke with the pharmacist who literally could not be bothered with my questions about when I might be able to get my prescription. She said it was ordered from the 'warehouse' and that they would call me when it came in but if I didn't want to wait, I could go somewhere else and get them to transfer the RX. I opted to wait. Huge mistake! Yesterday, while picking up 2 other prescriptions, I inquired about my refill on backorder. I explained everything that had taken place thus far to the tech and gave her my previous RX bottle for informational purposes. She checked on the computer and said 'this RX has already been filled.' And so I say to her, no, as I so painstakingly explained, it was never filled because you were out of the drug and could not fill it and I've been waiting for you guys to call me when it came in. Immediately she became combative! Then she tells me that, yes, they have the drug in now, BUT, I can't have it because 'oh look, this refill expired a few weeks ago.' Umm. No, it didn't 'expire,' it's been in your system awaiting the restock of the drug! She very rudely tells me that I'll have to go see my dr (and pay the $30 copay,) and obtain a new prescription. What? I'm in disbelief at this point. And when I asked if she heard any of what I had said to her previously, she began talking over me saying it's not their fault because they're all new and training and learning the rules and I'm out of luck! And that she would be happy if I took my prescriptions elsewhere! DONE! Not to worry! WALGREEN'S will never get my business again for anything!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213531c24638b:0xa635a2eff497a769"}
