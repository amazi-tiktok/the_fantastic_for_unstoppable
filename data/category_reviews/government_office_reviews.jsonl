They advised me to call the local law enforcement, which is Foley Police Department. When I called, the lady who answered the phones informed me that all of the Covid-19 guidelines put forth by the governor, were merely suggestions. Obviously  the almighty dollar is more important than everyone\u2019s health. Thanks so much for your help, Foley PD!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0bdfbe46864d:0xa26a7c5481bfa63f"}

The exit is almost always backed up but never have I seen anybody sit on the shoulder of the road in a line waiting to get off the exit. There was as least 10 cars on the shoulder of the road before we even came upon the exit. I wasnt sure what was going on, I thought maybe there was a wreck so I continued to slow down until I saw the exit lane appear and when I did I turned on my blinker so I could get over. I saw an officer in a police truck with Owens Cross Roads on the side and assumed the police would surely let me over. I continued inching slowly to the right with my blinker on and the police officer pushed forcefully up so I couldnt get over and then rolled down his window and started yelling at me, \"you better watch where you're going.\" I am in shock at how disrespectful and rude you're police officer acted when a car is simply trying to get over in a correct and legal manner. I can't believe your police officer would rather have a car sit at a halt on I10 blocking traffic than let them over. Chivalry is surely dead.\n*I posted this on the Owens Cross Roads police department page as well but thought I should post here also so the Foley police department is aware that people are now using the shoulder as a new turning lane. I have not had any problems with the Foley police department. *", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0bdfbe46864d:0xa26a7c5481bfa63f"}
