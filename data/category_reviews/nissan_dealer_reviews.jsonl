I was shopping for a Nissan Rogue. They had a very good variety in stock. My Salesperson was David Vaughn. He was outstanding to deal with. David was very helpful and took all the time I needed to look at the different options. There have only been a few car sales people who I would be willing to deal with again. David Vaughn is in that select group. From our looking, test drive, and eventually negotiating the deal, I could not have been more pleased with my experience. Besides David, his Floor Manager, Ricardo was also very helpful with helping make the deal work. Chad in Finance was great to deal with as well. I highly recommend Serra Nissan of Sylacauga.

We made sure of this prior to going, as it is a bit of a drive. When we arrived, they had myseteriously lost our information and the quote they had just referenced on a call the day before from the manager. We refilled out everything, and suddenly the quote was $43k instead of the $38k we were offered previously and told over the phone they would honor. When I called them on the discrepancy, they suddenly started saying that the quote had been on a used Titan, even though they didn't have any used Titans on the lot, and we had driven and looked at four different new ones. The manager on duty (different from the one I had talked to multiple times on the phone), talked down to us and said it was a \"misunderstanding\". We presented the facts, but the manager blew us off, so we walked out.

The finance officer after making us wait so long tried to pressure us into buying an extended warranty. We had to wait so long the detail crew had left so we had to bring our car back the next day to get it detailed and floor mats put in because they forgot them in the car. The sales crew had little knowledge of the features of the car. Sandy Sansing name has always represented professionalism to us although in the past we dealt with the Ford dealer in Daphne.

I bought a truck from them at an outrageous price (had no options at the time and needed a truck A.S.A.P. for business) and I have spent over $5,000 fixing it in the 6 months I've owned it. I was told by Lee and the \"salesman\" that the truck was $11,000, only to charge me $13,000. Of course once I realized what they did and contacted them they play dumb and it is too late. I know if I should have taken more time to review and ask questions but it was the end of the day, past business hours already and I needed to leave with the truck that day. Regardless you should never practice those business ethics in any industry. I have had to change the rotors, brakes, brake drums, brake cylinder, master cylinder, calipers and brackets, hub assembly, CV axles, steering arm, I am in the process of changing the transfer case (over $2,000 on it's own) and it still needs a steering column, gear box, front differential, driveshaft and possibly the rear differential. When it's all said and done I will have put at least 5 times the value of this truck into making it run right and paying it off. I am a self employed remodeler and I have missed countless days of work, lost countless jobs and it's gotten to the point that I am having trouble paying for my daughters daycare and buying her essentials.
