I'm giving them 2 stars only because their service people were so nice.  Unlike other services in this area, they do not take debit or credit cards, and you cannot charge to your room (cash or check only).  This is really inconvenient, as I don't generally take my checkbook or much cash to the beach.  We arrived about two hours before they closed on our first day at the beach and asked for a quote for the next two full days and for the two hours remaining on that day.  The service person quoted an almost entire day's fee for just two hours, which I did not take (although I did book the two full days).  It seemed odd to me that they would rather let it sit there set up and unused rather than make some money on it.  Also, they did not have enough service people to handle the work.  Our chairs/umbrella were never set up before 8:15 AM and we had to do almost all of the repositioning of the umbrella ourselves because their personnel were just not around.  We also lost the last three hours on our last day--Orange Beach had light rain but because there had been a lightning strike in Foley, they said they were not allowed to have umbrellas up.  We were not offered a refund.  We plan to go back to the Sleep Inn next year, but I'm seriously thinking of purchasing our own chairs and umbrella rather than deal with this again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0644f0966049:0x804054723b7c6e4b"}

So, my husband took off work to use it On A Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday & Monday.  But, they didn\u2019t bring it out until 2:00 pm on Thursday when it was supposed to be there early that morning.  He called and they give him the run around.  So, when he finished with it, he called them to come and get it and left it on 3/4 of a tank of fuel.  So after two weeks they finally came to get it and charged us over $2900.  The guy told my husband that the extra was for fuel when he left it with more fuel than it had to begin with which was a half tank.  The guy that brought it out, dropped it off and handed him a paper to sign.  So apparently that paper said that it had a full tank but my husband didn\u2019t get time to confirm it.

I could have gotten a MUCH better deal from another dealer but I didn't want to drive over an hour if I needed parts. For this reason I was willing to overlook the salesman who had ZERO knowledge of tractors, had no idea what a flail mower was and couldn't tell me what features would justify the expense of one implement over the other. I was willing to ignore  the random mechanic who wandered onto the sales floor trying to talk me out of the machine I wanted even though he had no understanding of my needs. I also endured the pain of dealing with the rude and unwelcoming finance manager who had the personality of a shoe. All of this because of the promise of a good service department and the full coverage warranty through Kubota and KTAC which is supposed to cover EVERYTHING on the tractor. Fast forward a few months and it's time for a small part that broke. I went right to HMTC service dept only to find out that not only is the part not covered, but they don't even have the part in stock and will take a month to come in. Ok, chalk it up to bad luck. Another month or so later I head to HMTC again for simple parts and they have none in stock. This happened a total of 4 times and I finally give up. The management here is out of touch with the market and their customers. They refuse to hire competent, qualified employees. Even the lady and the front door acts like you're interrupting her day when you walk through the door. Never again will I do business with or recommend anyone to HMTC.

Oh, and i was late getting it back with no extra charge. Not saying its okay to be late returning here but that was pretty awesome.\nThe main reason i originally  came to you guys was because everyone else wanted a insane deposit on top of higher prices than you guys. Not sure if that policy is still the same but I will find out tomorrow i guess. Coming down to rent a skid steer and dump trailer if you guys have one.

{"user_id": "104693508538894411256", "name": "Bryan Carmean", "time": 1494633175881, "rating": 2.0, "text": "I have rented on 3 separate occasions from Valley Rental & up till today I could have honestly provided 5 stars. I was always treated with great personalities and their equipment is adequate  with great rates. However, after today I can honestly say I will never rent with them again and would advise other DIY\u2019ers to steer clear. The issue is that there is no way to hold the company accountable if there's an issue. Unlike Robin Rents, United Rentals, etc the buck stops at valley so if the owner disagrees with your personality then you lose.\nI rented a small mini backhoe to do some yard work for a 4 hour overnight rental with the intention of possibly keeping it for the weekend. Unfortunately the equipment was rented out  with no working brakes outside of the hydro static system itself. With that being said while attempting to switch from low to high gear the tractor got stuck in neutral and began to run away out of control an was unable to reduce the speed due to a complete absence of a manual functioning brake. This quickly escalated into a very bad situation which forced me to dive the back hoe bucket into my asphalt driveway (scoring It indefinitely) in order to prevent a potential disaster on a 3k plus lb. piece of equipment.\nNeedless to say I am not one to complain which is where I messed up. I received a call this afternoon from Ross who asked why the tractor was not returned @ 0900. This immediately infuriated me as I had explained the day before I would likely be keeping it for the weekend. The situation got completely out of control after explaining the incident that had occurred with the faulty tractor. To be fair he was prompt on offering a mechanic to come look at the unit but protested my explanation of the brake system and pointed blame. To make matters worse they literally had to call the local Kubota dealer to verify the brake system characteristics. I found this out by calling Kubota myself to verify this myself and was informed by Kubota that Valley Rental had them. After this I decided I wanted nothing more to do with their equipment and lies and called to have them just pick up the tractor and be done with it. Upon contact another argument took place with myself and Ross which led to Ross cursing and using profanity at me and hanging up the phone after stating he was sending someone to get his tractor. At this point I have no idea what I am even being charged and no one I can talk to verify how to resolve this issue as the GM himself will just hang up on you. All in all I find it very frustrating that there is no way to hold Valley Rentals accountable for their actions. The problem is at the top and not the solution like larger rental facilities that you can hold accountable. They did by no request of myself refund a portion of my rental (1 hour of use and 3 \u00bd gallons of fuel to be exact). They did not even offer to repair the driveway and Ross never apologized for his professionalism & disrespect & I of all people know professionalism being a 10 year disabled combat Vet. Honestly, the majority of Valley Rental is spot on. But with situations like these customers can be taken advantage of and have no avenues of recourse. All in all I say rent at your own discretion and hopefully nothing goes wrong because if it does your on your own. Otherwise be smart and rent only from organizations that can and will hold themselves accountable for their mistakes and lack of communication.\nI assume they will rebuttal against this review, possibly even with an apology from Ross. However, if the GM wanted to correct the issue it would have been done prior to me posting this review and in a timely manner. At this point an apologize given due to a public review is nothing more than an attempt to discredit the review and salvage other/ new  customer relationships that may be harmed by my sharing of a real world experience in order to prevent others from experiencing similar stressful & unsafe situations", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1495052869452, "text": "Mr. Carmean, we are very sorry you feel the way you do. We believe the entire situation could have been avoided with better, calmer communication.\nOn May 11th, Mr. Carmean rented a mini backhoe.  He had informed the counter that he was paying for a half day/overnight rental and that he might extend out to a day to 2 days.  His rental expired at a half day at 8am and, as a company policy, we reached out to see how long he wanted to extend. This communication upset Mr. Carmean, to an unreasonable degree.\nAt that point, he informed us of the situation that occurred with the brakes of the mini backhoe.  As he described his situation the first conclusion, based on the information given, the machine was put into neutral and gathered speed going down a driveway and the parking brake system, which is used to hold the machine in place, not stop it when going that speed, did not stop the customer.  We then stated that we wanted to check the machine and wanted to send a mechanic out to make sure the machine was safe to use, per company policy.  We simply wanted our experienced mechanic to inspect the machine and determine what was going on.  These are hydrostatic machines and are not meant to go downhill in neutral, taking the machine out of the hydrostatic operating system and forcing it into neutral, to gain speed, can cause harm to the machine, and most importantly, the operator.\nWith the situation and Mr. Carmean, calmed down, our mechanic in route, the customer called the local Kubota dealership and asked if Kubota machines had brakes. Without knowing what machine the customer was referring to, the situation that occurred, etc.  they answered with a general statement of, \u201cYes, Kubota machines have brakes.\u201d  The customer then called us back and was irate again calling everyone liars.   We were informed, by our Kubota dealer, when Kubota tried to reach out to him again, from someone actually in service, not just someone answering the phone, that Mr. Carmean would not let the Kubota Service manager get a word in and continued to verbally abuse him as well.\nIt is our company policy to educate our customers on the use of a machine before we allow them to leave our store with it. On the back side of our rental agreement, we address the inspection of the equipment, use of the equipment and the customer\u2019s responsibility in an of emergency or equipment malfunction. Mr Carmean agreed to and signed this contract. Despite the fact, he did not follow our guidelines regarding the proper usage of the machine or the guidelines when an accident occurred, we did not charge him any extra and actually refunded him for the time he did not use.\nWhile we don\u2019t like to have unhappy customers, as we base our business on customer service, we also won\u2019t allow customers to verbally abuse our staff."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626ccd09d65d83:0x5440ec2d9e1b3282"}
