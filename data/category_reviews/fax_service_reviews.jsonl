You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

Our records indicate that you\u2019ve shipped two packages with us in as many years. One internationally, yes - we must ask questions about your shipment. \u201cWhat are you sending? What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I own a small business that I run out of my home in McMullen Cove (and yes, I do have a license with the City of Huntsville).  I mail packages on a daily basis.  Today, I missed my mail pick up and our local post office had already closed so we drove down to this store so that we could ensure our packages would go out today.  My 12 year old went in first and was refused service.  So, I then took the packages and went inside only to be told that, \"I don't receive anything from the Post Office for compensation and am not required to provide service to you.\"   I asked for her to put that in writing, she refused, spewed some other nastiness until 2 other individuals came in and I told her I would be reporting her to the proper authorities and I left.   As I type this, I am still shaken, that this kind of bigotry and hatred can still exist.  That people feel they have the right to treat others with such vile.  I will not be returning to this location ever and would strongly urge others to also find somewhere else to spend your hard earned money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533411883334, "text": "Wow, I feel I have to respond to this - this goes beyond misleading and is simply a lie.

We really try hard to make every customers experience here a very good one. As I explained to you when you were here - your postal labels would not scan. I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan. Again, I'm sorry that you are not happy, but please don't make a racial issue out of a situation that race simply had no bearing. That is extremely sad.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I was shipping to packages off today, one to my mortgage company and another to At&t. When I got to the counter the representative told me that AT&T system was down but she would check to see if  it was back up and running. It was still down so she directed me to the UPS store about 1.2 miles away and I went to go get in the car to call ATT before going to UPS to see if this was a outage all over it just Fedex Kinkos. The ATT representative told me they didn\u2019t have a issue so I go back in the store to see if their system was back up. A older lady that I helped in the store before leaving stopped me and said the Caucasian guy behind me earlier had a package he was shipping back to At&t as well. The representative told him that the system was down but she would hold it for him and ship it when the system came back up. I asked the representative when I walked back in the store was the system back up, she replied no it\u2019s still down. I asked could she hold my package and ship it when it come back up, she replied they aren\u2019t allowed to do this.\n\nI replied but you just did it for the Caucasian man who was sending a package to At&t to. She looked shocked!  She replied she isn\u2019t suppose to do that but my problem is you did do it & he was behind me. You sent me to UPS but you didn\u2019t send him! Do you know how this makes me feel (small very small) because I\u2019m Black I can go to UPS but because he is white you can hold it for him and ship it later.

However, since she is no longer in the store, if they accept my perfectly good boxes, I will use this branch again.  if not, I will continue to ship through my employer.\n\nPREVIOUS POST: This used to be my favorite shipper and favorite FED EX location.  I even have my own personal Fed Ex account.  However about a year ago Fed Ex must have brought in a new female day manager or supervisor and she behaves like a shrew.  I was believe her name was Helen.  She misquotes Fed Ex's shipping policy and refuses to use \"banker's\" boxes and other good boxes that are actually more sturdy than she sells at that outlet. She says it is FedEx's policy and I have since found out - it is not FedEx policy, but may be the individual store policy.  But she says it is FedEx policy.  However, she is most loud and belligerent and actually refuses to ship unless in boxes \"like she sells\" and pulls off the shelf \"because Fed Ex will no longer accept those boxes\".  Not true.  She won't accept the boxes.  She claims my boxes are not as sturdy (not true) and it is FED EX's policy not to accept those boxes.  Not true.  I've checked Fed Ex's shipping and packing policies and my boxes are very acceptable...and they are more sturdy than the boxes she is trying to force me to buy.  I will no longer ship there but ship through my work and have the charges deducted form my payroll.  Fed Ex is happy to pick up my boxes at my work without trying to make me buy boxes from Fed Ex.  My work place ships many boxes like my boxes (that's where I get my boxes) without any problem.  Someone needs to retrain or terminate the weekday supervisor or manager at this office.  I have read of many complaints about the personnel at FedEx-Kinko locations since Kinko and Fed Ex combined their locations.  I will not go back to this location with Helen there.  When I can't use my work place for shipping (as when the boxes too heavy for me to take in), I have driven 35 miles round trip to drop off my boxes elsewhere instead of dealing with this unpleasant person...what a shrew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b9130ca25b5:0x5bd40fa6ae8c11d"}
