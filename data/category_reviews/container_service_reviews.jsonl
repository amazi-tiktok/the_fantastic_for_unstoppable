The nice delivery man even came back to move dumpster to place it exactly where we needed it for easiest reach. When I needed to extend the rental past 1 week just a bit, owner graciously worked with me with zero hassle. After pickup, they cleaned so you could not even tell there was a bin. Was worth every penny in time saved and less stress, instead of trying to haul out truck loads of rubbish to dump off site.
