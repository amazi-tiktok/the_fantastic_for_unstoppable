I wouldn\u2019t give them another penny of my business in my lifetime nor will my family.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the two ladies running the front were extremely rude, and acted as if they didn\u2019t want us there at all. Once we were seated, our drinks were slammed down on our table. 15 minutes passed before we saw them again to place our orders, of which we were given major attitudes.\n\nWe ordered a mango lassie, which was very gritty and was made from some sort of powder. The yogurt tasted rotten, and we told the server about it. She snatched it off our table, and rolled her eyes.\n\nWhile we were here, and the 15 minutes passed by, we saw two other tables get up and walk out without ordering because of the terrible customer service given to them by the \u201cmanager\u201d. Please roll back your cameras and watch people walking out after encountering the most rude servers/managers in Huntsville.\n\nThe rice was so dry, we asked for a different entree. Once we got the bill, she refused to take off the drink that cost $3.99 because we took one single sip out of it to find it wasn\u2019t good, and the yogurt was sour. She said \u201cyou took a sip so you\u2019re paying for it\u201d. I told her that was ridiculous, that it was rotten, and she rolled her eyes, snatched my debit card from my hand and charged it.\n\nI asked where the manager was, and she said \u201cI\u2019m the manager\u201d and laughed. I truly hope the owners read this review because I have been a very loyal customer to this location, and the chef despite the Ruchi drama. Now I\u2019ve decided to never come back here.

With that in mind, I decided to try the Lamb Tikka Masala. It was served in a metal bowl. There were a great deal of lamb in the mixture (see the photo). There was also a lot of it. I ate about half of the dish and got a take-out box for the remainder to enjoy it later.\n\nIt was a tomato cream sauce with spices harboring a different flavor than I am used to experiencing. It looked like a thick tomato bisque soup and had some tomato flavor but with different spices.\n\nI also had a Naan bread to accompany the dish. It was very much like the pita bread often served in Greek restaurants and had a similar flavor. There were four large slices of bread.\n\nOverall, the meal was very filling.\n\nMy dining companion ordered the Tandoori chicken. It is pieces of chicken with yogurt and spices and cooked in a clay oven. I had one of the chicken pieces and liked it very much. Again, a different spice than I am used to having but it tasted good.\n\nThe chicken was served on a plate that was sizzling when it came out. Obviously, it was very hot and an impressive presentation with the chicken sizzling rapidly.\n\nFor a drink, I ordered Masala Tea. Again, I had never had this tea and ordered it on a whim. It was very good. Strong black tea with milk and spices, probably cinammon and some other spices. It was robust and filling and served hot.\n\nThis restaurant is in the back of a shopping center and can be easy to miss. Until we got close, I did not see the sign although we were looking for it.\n\nThe meal was tasty and the prices were very reasonable. The servings were generous and many adults will have food left over to take home for another meal.\n\nFor those who have not tried Indian cuisine, this would be a good place to start.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6dsTnmwlDgq5lxG1NHW_vXiSY8narQmHiffWE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT_MuHJ-Q5Tdy1zWssaxlpTxYznq_o_cLMc7dU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1626811951087, "text": "Thanks Ralph for you good review.

My daughter (who has a medical issue) said root beer, as I told her no due to the caffeine (diet restriction), the cashier jumped in and stated that Barq's Root Beer is Decaff.  Going against my better judgement I allowed her to get the Root Beer thinking maybe I was wrong.
