I have had to close down a large facility with only a few months notice and generated a massive amount of junk that needed to be discarded. Trey met with me, helped generate a game plan, and has stood behind his word at every moment.\n\nHis team is top-notch, works extremely hard, and is always courteous to me and the other employees. They are considerate of the facility and the other equipment, show up on time as scheduled, and always perform at the best of their ability. If you have junk that needs to be removed, Trey provides a service that takes care of all of your needs at a price that is highly competitive. Just a fantastic company all the way around.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2eb0a33a367:0x47cfeced1977c680"}
