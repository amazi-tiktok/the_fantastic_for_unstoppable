First off they do not ensure that the uniforms that they use accommodate every child.  Secondly the league sees it necessary to stack teams. Thirdly the league president Chris Rogers tells people that PCYB league is a \"Christatorship\".  Also a board members husband who is a coach by the name of Jerimiah Moss tells a player to sling a bat so hard it flies up a parents a$$.  The league also caters to travel ball players by only having games during the week instead of on Saturday. My child will never play in this league again.\n\nOnce again another terrible year with PCYB. Coaches Levi Rentz and Keith Daughtery are complete jerks and only care about travel ball in which their kids play. Practices have been cancelled because of travel ball. These coaches have yelled at players and parents including myself. These 2 want to be men have no business coaching kids.\n\nThe league board needs to be completely wiped clean. It's made up of a bunch of arrogant pompas idiots. The feel like this like should be high and mighty. This league should focus on teaching the fundamental and fun but that's not the case. The board also conducts illegal activities by holding raffle which is illegal in Alabama.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccc38b55211b1:0x275d7568b862592b"}
