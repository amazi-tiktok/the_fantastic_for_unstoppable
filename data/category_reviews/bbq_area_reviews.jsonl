We both got large BBQ loaded fries and split some fried pickles. The fried pickles are AWESOME and the ranch is definitely homemade, it is the best ranch I think I\u2019ve ever had (and I\u2019m really picky). The BBQ on the loaded fries was insanely good but the size of the large fry itself was very small, two orders would make more of a full meal. It was $19 for all of it, the amazing pickles made up for the lack of size of the fries.
