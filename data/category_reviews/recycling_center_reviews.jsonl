Our account is a residential weekly pickup of recyclables and garbage, and we switched to them last Fall 2019 because we were really taken by their salesman -- probably not the salesperson described in some of these reviews. Since then, we've had reliable pickup every single week, including holidays. Every time I had a billing question over the phone, I received great service (special shoutout to \"Tori\") and pleasant conversation. This current week was the only time they missed a pickup, and a call to Tori clarified that, not surprisingly, they are not picking up recyclables because of the current pandemic.

This is a \"single-stream\" recycling center, where all recyclables including plastic (with the diamond symbol on it), paper, aluminum, and glass go into one container. So this makes it super easy to just dump all your recyclables in their compactor and not have to sort through your recyclables. I hope the people who actually sort through the crushed recyclables get paid well though, that must not be easy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4de778c08221:0x4c73ba72f2ef401d"}

And 1 last thing, they do have some of the better prices(by cents pennies) but I can go to dothan to panhandle and get waaay better prices(that\u2019s where jack takes their metals and sell to panhandle is what I\u2019ve been told) but unless I have a very big load where  the price difference matters I go to jack bc I\u2019ll use 15$ in gas to get to panhandle vs. less than 8$ to go to jack.
