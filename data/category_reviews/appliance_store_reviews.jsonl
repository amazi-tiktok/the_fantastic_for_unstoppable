I DIDNT COMPLAIN.  the next was a washer which had to be repaired I believe like 2 or 3 times well the last time they fixed it they brought it back damaged dented scratches on the front sides and top a missing piece of plastic on the door and guess what I called and they never called back. I felt like they didnt want to admit to it and I questioned if this was even the same machine. I was disappointed but we thought we would try them one more time.. this was the absolute worse time too I'm hoping management reads this. But me and my husband got a nice furniture set. Well the couch has been nice the electric recliner is starting to squeak but no complaints wood is in tact so it's fine but the absolute worse is my recliner. We have had it almost a yr the arms were worn upon arrival. Called and it took about 2 months for the repair man to come because of surgery.he refused to fix it said it was too much work because of the damaged wood. Well a week before he came I made a call telling them it was having trouble reclining they told me the repair man would fix it. Well I looked under the chair and saw damaged wood and couldnt believe it. Next time I ever rent furniture or any of you please ask to see under the chair before purchase. Take pictures before and after arrival. The bottom was damaged and the side that the recliner button is on is almost falling apart. They actually told me they would pick it up to fix it after hounding them for months to the point I actually had to go up there to have anyone return my calls  manager assured me it would come back not damaged after all the other products. GUESS WHAT!! came back with a poorly sewn RIP. STILL HAVING TROUBLE RECLINING! the bottom wood has been fixed but the wood around the recliner button is more damaged than ever. I HAVE SI JOINT DYSFUNCTION RA AND POSSIBLY FIBROMYALGIA ALONG WITH DIVERTICULAR DISEASE SO THAT MEANS I CANT TAKE THE MEDICATION TO TREAT MYSELF AS IT FUTHER DETERIORATES MY COLON. I want to be able to recline without having to almost stand up to make it work. It used to be delayed but now it's almost getting impossible to recline and that poorly sewn RIP was a cover up they ripped my appolsry. BY THE WAY I CAN SEE THE FOAM IF THAT PAINTS U A PICTURE. The arms are a little saggie still and yet I just want it fixed the manager after me calling three times decided instead of handling the situation he was going to take the day off? PLEASE AARONS FIX IN A TIMELY MANNER WE PAY YALL IF YALL HAD NO CUSTOMERS YOU WOULDNT HAVE JOBS. 2 MONTHS IS TOO LONG TO NOT HAVE FIXED THIS. (Not including the yr we have waited) I DONT APPRICIATE THE QUALITY OF THE BUSSNIESS YALL HAVE GIVEN US. thank you for taking the time to read to anyone who wants to hear a real review and for yall as a company to understand from a customer how this looks and feels to be left in the dark. Edit: contacted corporate. District is looking into the situation I'm glad I found out about it. Willie has been avoiding talking to me so hopefully we can get help. We have made all payments on time and have tried giving bussniess after everything that has happened. It's almost been a week now and he is still dodging me due to being \"busy\".

They can\u2019t even call us & give us updates.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620927576743, "text": "I am very sorry you are unhappy  Mr. Brown\nUnfortunately I think you have the wrong furniture store as we do not have you in our system as having made a purchase with us.\n\nHowever,  I would like to address your complaint about a furniture establishment.\n\nUnfortunately for most businesses selling anything in America we are faced with challenges that are out of our control. For example,   there are shipping delays from overseas of products that are needed here for the assembly of furniture and chips for new cars.  Because of those delays dates change every day. When we do let our customers know a date, it can change the same afternoon which frustrates the customer even more.\n\nBefore the Pandemic, we could deliver on 90% of our goods within a 2-4 week time period. Now we cannot promise any date...the only thing we ask is that you hold on to your old furniture until your new furniture  arrives. We have even loaned out new furniture while a customer waits.\nWe have wholesale prices right now to help with that unfortunate waiting period. Some items come in next week after delivery, but some do not. It varies with every piece.\n\nWe value our customers, and if we could change what is going on in America we would . We go above and beyond for all of our customers. I just ask that you try and understand the circumstances that all retail establishments are having to deal with and navigate through. They are difficult, and we are all trying our best to get your items here as quickly as we can.\nFactories in America are also understaffed, and those who are working are doing their very best as well. Transportation is trying to find more drivers, so that items can also be delivered in a timely fashion.\nWe have kept our prices  lower than anyone  to help better ease that frustration of timely delivery dates. So it is a great time to purchase from us, but patience will be needed in case dates change on an item.\nThank you so much for your understanding, and if you did purchase from us under a different name - I am sorry for the delays, and I too wished we had control over dates fluctuating."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e9ae266e8c0cf:0x9e6dbbd1150862fd"}

I found the recliner that I had been searching for and asked if it was available in a different color. The sales lady rushed to answer \"No\" without checking their website or trying to verify her answer... I left there and went online, found the lady had lied and it WAS available in the color I wanted. So I drove to a neighboring city store and found a sales lady who was more than eager to help me... so I give the Sylacauga location a 1 Star rating, but the Alexander City location gets 5+ stars!

I had to use my own personal Facebook for sales and my personal cellphone for advertising. I used my personal cellphone for collection calls . Most customers are extremely rude. And the store manager didn\u2019t make it any better with the things he wanted you to say . The store manager said \u201cI think this job has made me racist\u201d and it shows in his work he will rent quicker to white people than blacks and he is quicker to offer \u201chelp\u201d to white customers than blacks. The store manager has adhd or something he can not focus and puts all his task down on me . He is impossible to work for, some days he doesn\u2019t ask you to do anything other days he ask you to everything AND his job! He was never on time and always left early and takes long breaks.

They forgot to put our furniture on the truck and the delivery people had to come back and get it\ud83d\ude44 (I\u2019m sure if I had not called I would not have known)\nIncident #2:Two weeks later, which was on yesterday (Sunday) at around 12pm I called and spoke with OJay and asked was our furniture in. She told me yes(why didn\u2019t they call?) and that they can deliver it out same day. Okay cool. She then called back and said that we didn\u2019t pay all of our delivery fee which in fact when they delivered our furniture the first time my boyfriend gave them the delivery free PLUS A TIP. She then told me that it was okay and that they would take care of it. Later that day, at 4pm, I called again just checking to see what time they would be coming. The guy I spoke with asked would I be okay with getting it delivered first thing Monday morning. Uhh no. (My problem with this was WHY DIDN\u2019T ANYBODY CALL, I would be okay if they had the common courtesy to inform me of any issues instead of me having to call them.) The guy told me my furniture should be at my house no later than 10:45AM(I didn\u2019t know how if they opened at 11am) I asked was he sure and he said yes.\nSO THIS MORNING MY FURNITURE WAS NOT AT MY HOUSE AT 10:45! I called promptly AT 11am and spoke w/ the manger Rodney and he informed me that a driver was on the way to get my furniture to deliver it. If my furniture was not able to be at my house at 10:45AM they should have communicated that with me. I received my furniture at 12pm after all the mess I had to go through.

DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n\nFull story: I shopped at American Freight on Black Friday 2017 with high expectations after reading these reviews. And the experience in the store was fine. No pressure to buy, but a helpful staff answering any questions my husband or I had. We bought a sectional and ottoman set we liked even though they weren't available for delivery for 2-3 weeks. We were fine with the delay and left looking forward to it arriving in a few weeks (more time to find homes for our old stuff).\n\nThat's when the trouble started. Fast forward 4 weeks, no sectional and no call/news at all. I call the store and was told that my purchase wasn't on the truck as expected, but they would be calling other stores to see of they had it and we should hear something the next week.\n\nLife was busy so I didn't check again for another 3 weeks. This time when I called I was told they didn't know why, but it was on back order. But it would for sure be in the next week. I again expressed by hope that it would arrive as I very much looked forward to using my furniture.\n\n2 weeks later, no furniture.  At this point, 2 months after purchasing the furniture and as my husband and I are both active duty military and didn't have the time to go to deal with it, my mother-in-law visited the store on a Friday. She made a bit of a scene stating the facts in front of other customers, and wouldn't you know it our sectional and ottoman arrived on rush order the following Monday. Corners were scuffed in some areas, and a few tears from packing staples, but at that point we were so glad to have the furniture  and tired of dealing with the company that we accepted it anyway. I will never shop there again  and highly recommend you don't either.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bce410ad21f:0xb1653e3c3ad41741"}

However the great reviews must be only for furniture that they have in stock. The couch and love seat we really liked was not in stock and we were told it would be two weeks until our furniture would arrive This was 15th of July. It even said August 1st on the sales receipt.  Two weeks go by and we heard nothing. We called American Freight and we were told that they don't have a date that the truck will show up it will just show up one day. Three weeks out we had heard nothing and we're told it would take 2 to 4 weeks. At this point we would of asked for a refund and shopped somewhere else but their policy states you can get a refund after 4 weeks from purchase.  Now four weeks arrives still no furniture still no date a truck will arrive.  We call on Monday with all intentions to ask for a refund and were told there is a truck and the Manger will be in on Thursday for us to get a refund. Thursday comes no phone call from American Freight we call on Friday and we're told oh your couch is here. Alot of effort on our part to find the status on our order. So after 4 weeks and several days of a family of 5 sitting on the floor since we just moved to Montgomery we have our couch and love seat. When we picked them up we told them we were still in the market for furniture and we were told to come back and they will give us a good deal for being so patient  well why not give us a deal while we were there. We won't be back.\nGoing back to the day we purchased the furniture the couch and love seat we wanted they actually had in the back but it was already sold to a customer who was waiting for it to be delivered some sales people were telling our sales person to just give us that one but we would not do that to someone else. So it puts into question did our furniture arrive weeks ago and they sold it to someone else it's possible especially since they could never give us a date our furniture would arrive.\nWe do like the furniture but if you shop here and they don't have it in stock BEWARE you will never know when you will get it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1471896687656, "text": "We do apologize for the inconvenience, Wes.

When it was delivered, the delivery guy Preston had noticed they sent the wrong chairs but I had noticed the box with the table looked as if it had fallen off of the truck or dropped from a distance. After bringing in the table, they left and came back with the correct chairs. After putting together the chairs, I opened the box containing the table and it had indeed been dropped. It was well after store hours at this point but I still called the delivery guy with my issues. The next morning at 11 sharp, I got a call from the owner. Like he has obviously done before, apologized for it and said that he's send another out by the end of the day. TWO DAYS later, the table finally arrived. They opened the box to make sure that nothing is busted up and I was very pleased with the way it was handled. I was so pleased that we decided to order two more chairs from them. We were told that it took 2 weeks for the chairs to arrive. It was November 27th and we needed them before Christmas. Before they ordered the chairs, we had to pay and that wasn't an issue for us. We paid the full balance of nearly $180 for two Madrid. counter height chairs. Two weeks go by and no chairs. I was told that the truck hasn't come in but I'll definitely have them before Christmas. December 22nd, I gave them another call and I was told that I could pick them up the next day. I was overjoyed to hear that. On the 23rd I got a call from the manager telling me to not come because they wasn't there and he didn't want me to ride there for nothing. He said that he was just have them delivered when they came in. The delivery guy Preston brought to our home at 6pm that night. He told me that they were in a different box because they opened it to make sure that they sent the right chairs because of what happened the first time. Trusting his words, i signed for it then took them upstairs myself. I placed them in a closet, grabbed my things and left home until Saturday night. Christmas morning I pulled out the box, opened it and removed all of its contents. I then took the box to the dumpster. When I returned, I settled myself down to begin assembling the chairs only to find that the chairs HAD ONCE BEEN ASSEMBLED. There were marks on the chairs, the screws were stripped and rusty. and the floor protectors were very worn. There were also four screws missing as well. There were hand smudges all over the wood. There was nothing about those chairs that said NEW. In complete disbelief that Rodney the store manager for charge me full price for two chairs off the showroom floor then have me wait nearly a month to receive them made me a bit irate. Without thinking, I called the store on Christmas morning. After realizing, I messaged the delivery asking for the cell number of the manager and I've yet to receive an response. So as a result, I feel it's very necessary to be waiting in the parking lot with two unassemble Madrid counter height chairs and several questions that gonna require an answer as well as a solution. Until this, I thought very highly of American Freight and its coworkers. Now it's BUYERS BEWARE... there's a reason they say that all sales are finals. For me, I don't want my money back because I do want the chairs. I just want what I paid for and I DID NOT pay for recycled chairs", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1483030131860, "text": "We're very sorry to hear this happened to you, Sylver.

The salesman who served us had these real long dreadlocks and his salesmanship skills were the pits...he did not sale my mom and i what we wanted, what we liked nor did he offer to\nShow us anything decent that would also fit\nIn our budget. Yes thats right he never showed us anything on sale nor did he bother to ask what our spending limit was so he know what to work with. Instead he just showed us around the store that highlighted\nThe furniture with the 699 and up prices.\nWe spotted a black leather sofa that had 398 price tag on it, sat on it to try it out, and as we began to show insterest in it and began discussing to each other about maybe we should get this or not. Thats when the salesman kinda brushed us away from the actual sofa set that we were sitting on that was 398 and started reverting us back toward that 699 plus tax sofa set. Smh thats not the sofa set we wanted or was discussing.we felt that the salesman wasnt offering us what we wanted but yet offer us what he wanted us to buy.....and we are the customers...its our money not his....we felt like our wants were disreguarded so we decided to check another store, told the guy we were gonna check somewhere else also before we decide. Asked him for a bussiness card and of course he didnt want to give us one and by him doing so gave us even more reason to be absolutely sure that we dont want to shop there now.\nSo as we started to walk out the door the guy then decided to offer us a deal on a sofa set\n...A BETTER PRICE is what he said so im like oh ok he wants to work a deal on the actual leather sofa we were sitting on with the 398 price tax. So im like ok turn around and ask what are you offering...he reply...600 right now walk out..we refused and left and went somewhere else because once agin the guy was still attempting to sale us what he wanted us to buy rather than what we the customer wanted to spend our money on...", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462553897247, "text": "Hi Byrdie, I am so sorry to hear that you had this experience.

Ordering was easy and Chuck was always on top of things.  Delivery services were so great!  Davidert Mayes and his partner went out of their way to make the delivery easy and informative. They called ahead to let me know when they would be at my house. They brought in our refrigerator and hooked up the ice maker in just a few minutes. One very important thing that Davidert provided was tutoring on the use of the many different functions of this refrigerator. He patiently explained all of the different functions and demonstrated them as well as explaining  what we needed to do with the water and ice dispenser initially.  Both of these men were friendly, outgoing, and  professional. They are certainly an asset to Allsouth Appliance.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1619112643758, "text": "Thank you Debra, we appreciate your business and the review!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888c29796104ce57:0x6a4fc39c99d14d26"}

Marquez was extremely helpful!  I can't rave about him enough.  My issue came when I was told my dishwasher was in stock in Bham but due to the holidays their 1 installer wouldn't be able to install until after all the holidays.  Okay, I understood the desire to take a break and be with family.  After January 4th I still never heard from anyone to schedule my install.  I finally called on January on January 8th to track down someone to help get this installed.  They were able to come install my dishwasher on the 13th.  The gentlemen that installed my NEW Bosch dishwasher made me aware that the 3rd row was shipped with broken clips so it wouldn't work but that's okay they would have someone come right back out to fix the issue.  After several days of no communication I once again called the store and was told oh yea Shane can come out on January 25th.  Great! Finally I will be able to use my new dishwasher properly.  Shane arrives on the 25th with a 3rd row for the dishwasher.  He was NOT informed properly of the problem and only had the drawer itself.  So once again Im left with a dishwasher that can not be utilized to the fullest.  Shane tells me he will go back to the shop and grab the clips off of another dishwasher and be back to fix the issue.  I wait and wait.  I finally get a hold of Mike on February 5th.  He informs me that the job has been listed as complete!!!  There was no order to get new clips there was nothing listed as needing to still be fixed.  Mike tells me that he will call me back before the end of day OR call me on Monday February 8th to tell me what can be done.  Again, I wait!  I called today the 12th a FULL MONTH after my dishwasher was installed.  Mike tells me oh those clips are on back order.  I asked for some type of date as to expect them he states could be end of February.\nMy issue is the POOR COMMUNICATION!!!!   1st. the installer NEVER reported the correct issue with my dishwasher had he done so properly Shane would never have come to my house with the wrong part.  2nd Shane completed the job.  This is a HUGE FAIL!!!  3rd. Mike never contacted me to let me know there is no part readily available and it will be back ordered.  When I reached out as I've had to do every since they took my money back in December Mike acted a little confused to why I would be calling.\n\nI expect better when paying for a top of the line appliance.  I've gotten better service from a big box store!  I understand parts get broken in the box and no one is aware but this should've been taken care of in January! This was NOT a warranty issue as it was delivered to me broken!!! The product was not ever used.  I am NOT happy that I will have to wait until March to fully use my dishwasher the proper way.  The whole reason I came to All South was the earliest Bob Wallace could get the dishwasher installed was March 4th!!!  If I had known I would be stuck until March to begin with I would've gave Bob Wallace my money!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b91b8998ea1:0x1c5adc2f08bde249"}

All they had to do was install three appliances.  THREE.  The only thing these jag-offs got right was the delivery of the appliances and *sliding in* our new oven.  The dishwasher and microwave were both dropped.  This was obvious because (a) we saw the palette in our garage prior to installation, (b) one side of the palette was \"injured\", (c) the corresponding sides of the appliances from that side of the palette were both broken.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they didn't use the granite counter installation kit for the dishwasher.  This would help considering they don't want to fix the broken feet.  Now, when you open a loaded dishwasher, the whole machine rotates thereby \"dishcharging\" the bottom rack of dishes out onto your floor.  This is entertaining to guests.\n\nThe microwave is also fun.  The plate does not rotate properly so you can always tell when it's in use because of the \"thump-thump\" made by the turntable, much like a broken record but without the repetitive music.  Also, the clock is crooked so you can't tell if it's AM or PM (which actually matters during the winter when it's dark at 5AM and 5PM).  And the oven vent built into the microwave is broken so it slides right out after only unfastening two screws when it should be held together by four screws.  The other two take bits of the broken plastic housing with them.\n\nNormally I wouldn't care because these appliances are \"builder grade\" but it's the principle of the matter.  Allsouth is not interested in fixing or replacing the appliances which can be done EXTREMELY EASILY when you're a flippin' vendor.  They're only interested in minimalist work, single trips, and offering to \"send out an inspector\" which was already been done by the builder who verified that the pieces are indeed broken.  We're guessing Allsouth doesn't trust the builder that hired them in the first place.  They also will not come out on your time, only their time, so if you work and are busy from 8am to 5pm, you can bet you'll never see nor hear from them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b91b8998ea1:0x1c5adc2f08bde249"}

So now I have been charged 4 times for a washer and dryer that I've only had a month. I will be calling and having them come get it and demand my payments back.

{"user_id": "115504932104850664042", "name": "David Solomon", "time": 1482943464951, "rating": 1.0, "text": "For this review, I feel I must first present a little information up front.\nFor the last several months I have been having issues with the plumbing in my house.  My house was built in 2007 with PVC pipe throughout.  Let\u2019s just first say that after purchasing the home I later believed the plumbing was not installed to code, and first experienced several water leaks of which I fixed myself.\n\nSeveral months ago I hired a plumber to come in and resolve a hot water (lack of) issue.  The Hot water tank had made an awful screeching noise similar to what I have been hearing in my modern GE Refrigerator with a water filter. At the time the plumber removed a check valve on the water Heater which resolved my Hot water problem and the screeching noise.  No further investigation was conducted on why the Hot water heater started having issues and I believe that repair cost me around $100.00.\nSo in the last couple of months I have still have that screeching with my Refrigerator and the pipes had been banging whenever we flushed one of the toilets.  Upon doing some research to try and resolve the banging pipe issues I had come across an article on a thermal expansion tank upstream from the Hot Water Heater on the Cold water line.  I located mine under the house just as the main cold water line comes in the house. The tank has a valve in it and is supposed to give a cushion for the water when it expands.  I went to check the expansion tank and when I put on an air tester, water came out, which is an indication of a faulty tank.  I purchased a new one and left the air pressure at the manufacture default and installed it.  Now my pipes started banging worse and the tank started making a sucking sound. I further researched the issue and found an article that too much water pressure can wreak havoc on your water system so I went to Lowe\u2019s and picked up a cheap home water pressure gauge. I tested my system and found that my home was averaging around 130PSI. Based on this information resources indicated that a faulty Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) just up from the home water meter could be the culprit. I located mine by digging about a foot up from the local water meter and left it uncovered.\nIt was finally time for me to call a plumber as I am not one, and only completed the previous steps out of necessity.  I am a retired Enlisted Veteran and have not had a real job for six years and have been struggling to pay my bills.\n\nThe day before Christmas I called B & C Plumbing Inc. and left message on their phone system that I would be needing their services when they could work me in.  Tuesday after Christmas I received a courteous phone call from the B& C customer service and scheduled a Master Plumber to arrive at my home between 14:00 \u2013 16:00. Shortly after that Drew the Master Plumber called me from his cell phone and said he was on his way over because he had a cancellation and would come and resolve the issue.\n\nThis is where the negative experience starts.  Drew arrived at my front door knowing the information that I had already shared previously and I shared that information with him again on what my issue was going on under the house.  His first statement to me before looking at anything was that it was going to cost me $300.00. No indication of a discount for anything or because I was a Military Vet.  Now first off, I expected that he would be crawling under my home and fix some of the issues with the bagging pipes (Non-Code meeting).  He had no time to give me a run down on what the problem was nor what it the cost layout was to fix my issues.\n\nHe proceeded to place a water pressure gauge on the outside faucet and recorded that the PSI was 145. He then went to the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) and replaced it spending less than two hours of actual time far less work as much of the time was him on the Cell phone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487948819020, "text": "Mr. Solomon, in response to your review I would like to apologize for your unsatisfactory experience with our company.

First off, if Marcus is your salesperson expect absolutely nothing to get done or be done right. I ordered a bedroom and living room set over a month ago to be delivered on June 26th. All of my furniture didn't arrive on time... I still haven't received my living room furniture nor an update on when it's expected to arrive. I finally cancelled the order and asked for a refund yesterday. When my bedroom furniture did arrive, the wrong chest was delivered. Also, Marcus claims he forgot to include my bedrails and I didn't have screws for my headboard. The delivery fee was $100, with no assembly. I had to drive back to the store for my bedrails. No considerations nor accommodations were made for me regarding my time or gas even though this order was paid in full and this was a mistake he made. As of yesterday, he still could not give me an update on the status of my living room furniture. I finally spoke with the manager who was unaware of this situation and told me that my complaint was one of many and that Marcus had been demoted. However, this doesn't change the fact that I've been in my house for almost a month with no living room furniture and they've had the payment in full long before I even closed on my house.

The pricetag was certainly lower than anywhere else we looked, and it looked like OK quality furniture.\nLess than 3 weeks after purchase, the sofa literally fell apart. We're pretty normal sized people and have treated it with care. I turned it over and opened up the upholstery to have a look.  The construction quality is the worst I've ever seen; low grade partical board, half-rotted knotty 1/2\" thick pine, and the whole thing is held together with staples.  I identified 6 separate joints that had come apart inside the couch due to the staples simply slipping out of the wood, and many more that were halfway undone.\nI ended up taking around 3 or 4 hours and meticulously replacing pieces, reinforcing joints with metal brackets and screws, and closing up places in the upholstery which were mysteriously split and leaking stuffing.\n\nThe furniture here is truly of the lowest quality, even if it appears fine on the surface.  If you buy from here, make sure you also purchase their ridiculously expensive warranty (that will tack on $100 - $200 to your purchase), because you're gonna be needing it a whole lot.  If you need cheap furniture, go to the thrift store or use Facebook marketplace.

When the set was delivered, there was a minor issue and I called Akera, one of the managers, who genuinely cared and  helped fix our problem immediately. Within 30 minutes, Trent himself was standing in my living room resolving the issue and making everything perfect. That is exemplary customer service, and it made us feel that we could really trust purchasing from this company again.

I first contacted them on March 15 to fix the gasket seal on my front loading GE Washer.  The repair man did show up the next evening to fix the gasket seal, but also noticed there was a part missing.  He said he would order the part and let me know when it came in so he could finish repairing the washing machine.  I heard nothing from Harrell from March 16 until March 23.  Never once was I contacted about the part coming in, or when he would finish fixing my washer.  I would check back in with Harrell every couple of weeks with phone calls and texts.  Finally on May 8, he told me my part was in, and that it had been on back order (for over a month) and he would try to get to my place to finish the washer.  Two weeks later I called him from my phone to see when he was coming and he did not answer.  I then called him from my work phone, and he answered.  He said for the second time he was on his way to pick up my part and he would try to make it to my house the next day.  That was sometime in June.  It is now August 4.  I've received no further phone calls or texts from Harrell.  I texted twice with no reply.  I tried to call - no answer.  This is terrible service.  I absolutely would not recommend Harrell Appliance to anyone!  I pointedly asked several times if I should go somewhere else, and he assured me he would finish the work.  I'm pretty confident I was lied to the entire time, and am doubtful that a part was ever ordered.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a392eee2296d9:0x42e6dbb96f900980"}

I messaged them immediately and was notified that the office was closed and would re-open in the morning.    After speaking with someone about this he said he'd come the next day at 1:30pm.  It is well past 1:30 now, and I have not even been able to get in touch with them.  I am unsatisfied with every bit of this transaction.\nIt has been several days since I first saw the original dryer I asked for which was \"sold\". It is still listed as available ( I find that suspicious).\nUPDATE: They came out today to repair the dryer, my tenant just called and said it has already broken again.\nUPDATE 2: I am appalled at the unprofessional manner in which this company has conducted itself.\nI\u2019ve asked for them to remove the dryer from my property and for a full refund. They said they would be at the house at 4:00pm, then no one showed up. I had a tenant stay at the house for them, and he said he waited an hour and fifteen minutes before he had to leave. This is unacceptable.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ceb4da39ec6bf:0xabbd55b2f66864a7"}

I got it home and....well let's just say it IMMEDIATELY went back. It came with FREE bugs. They told me it would be a few days before they would be able to get me another. So I waited. Finally they called and said they had a brand new one in. I went to pick it up and turns out it was brand new but it had more storage. They said that the whole thing was their fault so they wouldnt charge me anymore and gave me an extra controller. Turns out THEY LIED! BECAUSE THEY GAVE ME A PS4 FILLED WITH BUGS, THEY CHARGED ME FOR THE EXTRA SPACE AND THE EXTRA CONTROLLER THEY TOLD ME WOULDNT COST ME ANY EXTRA! So at this point I'm already aggravated. It gets much worse. I'm standing in line to pay one day, and the 2 customer reps were speaking to each other. The one lady said \"Weve got people that haven't paid  in almost 4 weeks. If they would just pay on time we wouldnt have to go repossess their things\". Okay no big deal. Every now and then I get a week behind. BUT I ALWAYS CALL AND LET THEM KNOW AND I ALWAYS PAY FOR 2 WEEKS PLUS THE EXTRA FEES THEY TAK ON!!!! ALWAYS! The most recent week I was 5 days late. I called them and told them. And they had the audacity to tell me they would have to come and take it if I didn't come pay it within 2 days. I ONLY HAVE 100$ LEFT AND YOUVE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE 4 WEEKS LATE AND YOURE GOING TO COME TAKE MY PLAYSTATION THAT I HAD TO WAIT AN ENTIRE WEEK ON BECAUSE OF YOUR MESS UP!!!! YOU ADD EXTRA FEES!!!! YOU LIED AND MADE ME PAY MORE BECAUSE OF YOUR MISTAKE!!!! I told my mother and sister in Law yall were great to go get Washer and Dryers and TVs from. I gave yall business and this is how I get treated? When I pay the playstation off I will NOT be getting my Sofa from you. I will go to Aaron's and NEVER BE back. I will tell my mother and Sister and Law to go to Aarons. I will review you on every social media account I can because of how you treated me. My email is parks.samantha1031@gmail.

I bought a speed queen washer/dryer set from them in late September which cost me over $2000.  It would take several weeks for delivery so they set me up with a third party guy they use. On the day of the delivery the delivery guy called me several times to keep me updated on his schedule. At 3 he said he was on his way to pick it up and bring the set to me. At 3:15 the salesman from Siano's called me and said there was a piece missing (a lid lock) on the washing machine and it wouldn't work until they could get a new one. I asked if the delivery guy (who was older, rented a u-haul and had been keeping me updated all day) would get paid if I canceled the order. The salesman said \" No Mam\"!  I would have canceled but felt responsible for wasting the delivery guys time and money (obviously the salesman did not). It really bothered me that he called me at 3:15! It was delivered and took another week until I could use it. Now the most frustrating part, from the beginning the dryer gave me trouble. It wouldn't dry the load 100 percent (towels 55 percent, clothes 85 percent, etc.). I kept changing settings thinking I was doing something wrong. I finally called them and the repair guy came out felt the dryer and said there is plenty of heat. He told me to get my vents cleaned out, test some loads without it being attached to the vent. So I did all this and had my husband do different loads on different settings, etc. This cost us time and money. I had to get my vents cleaned out. My electric bill was $600 (not all the dryer but some). Finally it still didn't work and they decided to replace a part. Now it works. They sold me a broken washer and dryer and I spent a lot of time and money figuring that out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4259c06a59:0xea45271ed1090c5"}

I purchased a Speed Queen washing machine for $817 plus, from this store in January 2015 (Love this washer btw).  After a month or so, it got very loud & I started noticing a black \"dust\" from beneath.  This became progressively worse & I contacted the Huntsville store where I purchased it.  They told me they don't service my area.  I explained that this is a warranty issue, since I hadn't even had it 6 months.  The Manager, Jerum, agreed but said there was nothing they could do because they lost the service tech they had for my area & to call someone else & then get back with him with what they said.  I got Bob Wallace Appliance to come out.  Service guy found that the belt mechanism was messed up & caused the belts to get shredded. In addition... while the front panel was removed, noticed the wash drum had begun to rust significantly.  This was all pretty surprising to him & to me because honestly, Speed Queen washers are beasts!  Incredible cleaning in short cycles... highly recommend.  So this was just a fluke & I didn't lose faith in the brand.  I call the manager Jerum back & tell him the news.  He asks me to send him a picture of the report along with pics of the washer that I took, to his cell phone.  I think he said his email was not working that day. I sent everything.  Jerum called me back pretty quickly & said that the washer was on back order for over a month.  But as soon as he could get one in, he would swap it out.  I explained that I have kids, grandkids & a lot of laundry & can't go that long without a washer.  Jerum told me to go ahead & let Bob Wallace Appliance fix the washer enough to get it working so I would have something to use while we waited on the back order.  I agreed to this but was nervous about getting screwed.  So I followed up after getting off the phone with him by texting to the number he had given me.  I said... just to make sure there was no misunderstanding & reiterated the agreement.  He replied that yes, that was the agreement. I called Bob Wallace  back & the same tech came out & replaced the belt assembly.  I did have several weeks without a washing machine.  I waited about a week after when I was told that my new washer would arrive to call.  Jerum said they were still back ordered.  This went on with me calling & being told that it was still back ordered until November when I contacted Speed Queen myself to see if Jerum was lying.  SQ said they were behind in keeping up with the demand but that they would send one right away if the manager contacted them.  I sent the Manager a text at the end of November saying that my patience had run out & if I didn't have my new machine asap, that I was going to court.  I received a reply saying that he no longer worked there & to contact the new manager!!  I called the store & spoke with a manager named Seth.  Very nice guy, very apologetic.  He said they were left cleaning up many of Jerum's messes.  Said he would get my machine swapped out right away.  I was so relieved.  Until he called back to say that he had spoken to the main office & they were not going to replace my machine & if I had anything else to discuss that I should call a manager named Chris.  I call Chris.  This guy was unbelievably rude & actually said that they don't even make my machine anymore & I was just making up a story to get a new washer & they didn't have record of my having bought anything from their store.  I was livid!  I told him that I would be happy to take my proof of purchase along with all of my proof of the \"agreement\" with their previous manager to court & that it was beyond unprofessional the way any of this was handled. That's when he said to send him all of my proof via email & if I did that, then they would replace the washer.  I did & they didnt! Ultimately I threatened & got a refund but there is more to the nightmare.  Unfortunately the space for this review has maxed out.  Happy to provide proof of everything to anyone!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4259c06a59:0xea45271ed1090c5"}

She very rudely and told me that we couldn't use an equivalent part from a different brand, and completely took over the conversation. I pointed out that it was standard practice to have interchangeable parts, but she went on about how she had been doing this business for 20+ years and knew what she was talking about. She then offered to sell me a Maytag specific thermostat package for around $40. I ended up buying the Samsung thermostat for $8 on Amazon and installed it myself. My Maytag dryer now works like new with a Samsung thermostat.

Some place else\u2019s furniture will be made better and I bet their customers service is so much better also.\n\nThey have deleted my other review about things being fixed from previously. The manager at the time did fix the problem. But I made a stupid mistake by buying something else that was more exspensive thinking it would be better, now they don\u2019t want to fix that again a few months back. On top of that I completely forgot to come in and make November\u2019s payments (normally someone would call me between the 1st and 10th just to remind me)(I\u2019m a mother of two and full time college student so I\u2019m forgetful when I don\u2019t get reminders) they called me last week while I was sitting in class so I asked them to call me back in a couple of hours to discuss why they had called. Didn\u2019t think nothing of it. Well today I got a letter in the mail saying I was avoiding them and refusing their calls (which I have not I answer every phone calll that comes in because I never know if something might have happened to someone) then the \u201cnew manager\u201d tried to say she delivered this letter to my house today. This letter has a stamp on it has been through the post office lines and was in my mailbox at the bottom of the box(I haven\u2019t checked my mail in three days so it was full) but she proceeds to tell me that my account which as of today is 30days late it wasn\u2019t 30days late when she sent this letter to me. That she would be sending it to the court house this week. And that she would not work with me because I\u2019m 30days late as of today. That this was policy after 30 days. I worked at this store in 2017 for a while and they normally don\u2019t send to collection until 120 days or later. She also tried to tell me they have been calling I have not received but that one call from them a little over a week ago when I asked them to call me back and they never did then my grandmother received a call from them last night and she told me today when she seen me. So hearing this plus receiving this letter today I did call them only to be told she wouldn\u2019t work with me. I also know that when I worked there and I would help the collector there to make calls you can just click in the computer saying that you called when really you didn\u2019t. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay her right now Christmas is a few weeks away my sons birthday is also the week of Christmas and my car payment is due this week so I offered to pay November and December\u2019s payment on December 28th the Friday right after the holidays she then told me I would have to pay court cost and do it that way because my account wouldn\u2019t be there any longer.\n\nI have been dealing with farmers for a couple of years now and I always pay my accounts off wayyy earlier than need to be.\nThis is also the first time I have ever been more than two days late on making a payment. I understand they want their money, but sometimes things don\u2019t work out like that so they should really work with someone who has never been late like that. When I was employed there you still got worked with at 120 days out.

UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!!!\n\nI would not give this one star!!!!!\n\nUPDATE ***03/26/2021**\n\nI\u2019m changing this from \u201c1\u201d STAR TO \u201c4\u201d STARS\nThe technician and a manager came to my home and apologized for the miscommunication... The part unfortunately would not fix my refrigerator \u201cIce maker and Water dispenser\u201d because there is a shortage in the wiring and now I need a new refrigerator.  The technician was very professional, detailed in his explanation of why it did not work.  I will use SERVICE CARE again because even thou there was a \u201cball\u201d dropped in the beginning they did follow up immediately and did not blame everyone else they took OWNERSHIP and that is what we are missing in these days and time....You made a uphappy customer a HAPPY CUSTOMER...\n\nThank you", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1616515998859, "text": "(Part not available from manufacturer, last one found in the counry, part arrived today, scheduled for today).

Sometimes a unit is too old, and has too many problems, to justify repair. We issued a refund after the customer decided to buy a new unit rather than approve further repairs. -- Initially we traced her leak to a clogged condensate drain, but she continued to have the leak. After the drain was found clogged again and cleared, it continued to leak. Further investigation found that that her drawer was not closing perfectly because of a defective gear, which was allowing moist room air into the freezer which was building up high levels of frost, which was also causing her drain to clog. When the unit defrosted, it would produce the leak called us about in the first visit. The rails to the drawer were also rusty, which interfered with proper drawer closure.

This is one of the companies LG forces you to use. Even with LG covering the expense of the compressor, about 350.00 the quote was 800.00 for then to spend 2-3 hours to repair.  The worst part was the tech told me it was a 50/50 chance it would last. The reason behind the ridiculous price, the tech explained that there was a strong possibility that multiple service calls would be made in the first year and they dont get paid for those, meaning the price hike was to help cover their possible future expense  The going rate from several other companies not affiliated with LG was approximately 400.00 to swap out the compressor, vacume to 5 microns and refill with r134.  Today, I am having another company come to my home and swapping the compressor to the non linear compressor, all paid out of my pocket, the entire job cost me 595.00. So how can it possibly be so much for the LG compressor swap if LG is covering the cost due to warranty? Another noteworthy mentioning is that I told the tech I would mount the compressor myself and would sweat on the copper connections myself, but that wouldn't change the price according to the tech. It's called price gouging and its pathetic. Be very cautious when dealing with this company, there are much better options out there, thankfully I found one, thanks Appliance Service LLC.

When the technician came to evaluate my abnormally noisy dryer I was quoted and shown an invoice for parts/labor totaling over $560. I reluctantly chose to have my dryer repaired because buying a new dryer would cost several hundred more dollars. I was also required to pay half of the service fee before Service Care would come out to complete the repair\u2014I assumed so that the very expensive parts could be ordered. When *my technician arrived I was surprised to see him carrying a very small bag of parts and was finished with the repair in less than 30 mins\u2014I was expecting a little bit more for a repair costing well over $500 dollars. Come to find out when I researched the actual cost of parts I found out the parts cost around $35 which means service care charged me nearly 1000k an hr for labor. Please do not use this company. A total scam. Buy the parts yourself, watch a  tutorial YouTube video, and save yourself literally HUNDREDS of dollars.\n\nHeard back from customer service. Per their customer service rep my technician mistakenly charged me for the parts 4 times resulting in a quote that was over $200 dollars more than what it should have been. The invoice I received from the tech clearly states that only one was ordered for a parts/installation fee of $560.11 which alerted my spider sense. Customer service offered me an ultimatum of either $200+ refund because of tech\u2019s alleged mistake (meaning I still paid over $300 dollars to replace a $35 dollar part that took 30 mins to replace) or they would come out to take out the $35 part for a full refund. Despite having been charged a fee of $80+ for an in-home quote which by their own admission was inaccurate they refused to refund that. I only agreed to the repair because based on the description of what needed to be done to repair the unit seemed extensive and beyond my skill set. If I didn\u2019t have to take another day off wrk (on top of the 2 I already had to for the quote and the repair) for them to come out to take back what they put in I would have gladly had them come out and take it out. Found a step by step tutorial video on YouTube and the repair is actually quite simple.\n\nService Care this type of business practice is shameful to charge such ridiculous amounts of money for simple repairs. This is flat out fraudulent and predatory. Their excuse for such high pricing basically boils down to \u201cWe use nationally recognized software to provide quotes...\u201d Translation: We do it because we CAN. Not because it\u2019s RIGHT. They knowingly charge SEVERAL hundred dollars an hr for labor for relatively simple repairs. Buyer beware and be sure to do your research first. This repair could have been easily DIY and done for $35 bucks in parts and a Phillips head screwdriver.\n\nThe owner himself discourages buying parts off Amazon in his response but the Service Care website  actually contains a link that customers can use to buy \u201ccheap\u201d OEM replacement parts...from Amazon. :l\nAgain, a total scam, folks. Stay clear of this place.  Had I not questioned my order I would have been duped.  This is supposed to be a repair that the company does \u201chundreds\u201d of times but no one from company realized I was over charged by several hundred dollars (not a few dollars but several HUNDRED dollars) until I said something about it. Had I went to Publix to buy a gallon of milk and it rang up for $50, the cashier would have instantly thought, \u201cHuh...it\u2019s usually $3.99. Something must be wrong.\u201d Not Service Care. They will take your money and run without thinking twice about it. They still refuse to refund my in-home quote fee for a quote that was inaccurate.\n\n*Technician\u2019s name removed from review at the request of the owner", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559075893140, "text": "Hi, I'm sorry you were so unhappy with your experience, and I can see why. The technician made a technical error while building your quote. Instead of quoting for a pack of 4 rollers, he quoted for four 4-packs of rollers. The pricing software that we use thought we were replacing those parts 4 times, which increased the quote. (We would be happy to send you a copy of the original quote, which included the 4 rollers, not one). I feel certain that we would have caught that during our billing process, but we appreciate you calling us so soon after your repair to let us know. We're issuing you a refund for the difference. We stand behind our repairs with a one-year warranty which requires us to use OEM manufacturer parts which are usually more expensive than the cheap ones you find on Amazon. Of course, most of the cost of any repair, from any company, is the labor and skill that it takes to diagnose the problem correctly and replace it in a timely manner. I appreciate the feedback! Good and bad helps us to continuously grow and improve as a company.

I asked for someone to come out to look. After I told them my location I was told it would be $85 to inspect, but if they did repairs it would be subtracted from the labor cost. My TV was expensive so I was willing to accept the risk that it wouldn't be fixed.  and I gave him the model number. The technician called and we arranged a time and he was there in a reasonable amount of time. He asked what the problem was and I explained again that all HDMI ports were not working. He then went to search for a mainboard replacement for the TV. He couldn't find one.\n\nI'm giving them three stars because there was sufficient information given to them to be able to tell me over the phone that they wouldn't be able to find a replacement part. I explained my frustration to the technician. He said that they mostly deal with appliances and he'd never been unable to replace a main board for a somewhat new Panasonic (< 5 years) and that he wouldn't have time to train the staff to get all pertinent information. To me, that's a training issue.\n\nPolite and responsive people, but they need to do better with the information that they are given. They had the part number and the description of the problem.

The technician, Craig Harris, was professional, personable and most importantly knowledgeable.  After inspecting the downdraft and learning how new it was, he got on the phone with the GE Customer Care Team and they took over the resolution since the product was covered under warranty (in a previous call that I made to GE... they blew me off with the reply that the unit must not have been installed properly... which it was).  That situation was resolved with a swap of the defective GE downdraft.  Craig then diagnosed the DW problem as a broken soap dispenser that was surprisingly allowing the high pressure water to get into a small hole and leak down through the front panel and out to the corners and then onto my floor.  A 2nd visit was required to allow time for the part to be ordered (expensive little plastic booger).

(i have leased with this company on a previous occasion, my experience at that time was very sub par. the delivery was late and the dryer power cord  was damaged to the point of causing property damage to my wall plug in my home.) A red headed woman approached the counter with no mask and asked me \"how can i help you?\", i replied i am looking to lease a laptop. she then told me \"i have the desktop over there\" i stated then what kind of laptops do you have \" the kind that turn on!\" she stated. so i disregarded her unprofessional remark still uneasy about both employees not having on a face covering, and asked to know my options of computer choices. she then with an attitude that i was an inconvenience to her began putting laptop boxes on the counter. i read the specifications and made my choice. she asked if i had leased with them before, i stated yes. it had been more than 30 days since my last lease so i was directed to fill out another lease application. during this time of filling out the application i came to find out the employee that was behaving in this manner was the general manager. she then informed me while i was filling out the rental application that she \"hated these mask\" and that i did not have to wear mine while in the store. i was now fully uncomfortable from a collection of lack of safety procedure during a pandemic. i continued to wear my mask. once the application was complete another employee then took a copy of my drivers license. the general manager took another 10 minutes to ask me to please come into her office. she was pulling up things on her computer. she then turned to me and rolled her eyes and said\" so you have rented from us before huh? \" i said yes i have multiple times. she then proceeded to question why i was late on my rental payment. i told this brute of a woman that i had financial hardship and lost my job at the time. i got behind on the lease and once i realized i could no longer afford to get the payments from these loan sharks up to date due to exorbitant late fees and penalties i returned the leased merchandise. she then stated that she \"believed in giving second chances\". i  acknowledged the comment but did not rebut to the comment. she then looked over more information on her computer. and turned to me and said \" being late im ok with, but people keeping merchandise that is not theirs im not ok with!!\" at this point i have become very uncomfortable and feel as if my visit to the store this day has become a humiliation session for the store manager. i stopped the woman and told her i felt degraded and would no longer like to do business with this establishment. she then laughed at me and said \" fine then\". i contacted the corporate office for this company and was informed they condone this behavior. a few notes if you intend to rent from this establishment, you may be exposed to covid 19 by employees or other patrons due to lack of adherence of mask mandate while in this location or lease merchandise that has not been sanitized properly. you will be belittled by the staff if you ever have financial hardship while in a lease agreement with this company as well. i hope this review is helpful to those thinking of leasing from this company. i would recommend the better competitor YOURWAY RENT TO OWN which is located at 2547 Bob Wallace ave. when i left this establishment i went to your way and was able to lease a laptop computer in less than 15 minutes without being belittled or shamed. (quick your way rent to own history) they do not charge daily late fees(best ways policy is built to extort with late fees)  when a payment may be late and will work with you if you hit financial hardship. also the merchandise is of higher quality, the facility is cleaner, with more inviting more professional staff. stay safe out there in this pandemic!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c968658c4e5:0xe253ce2faeb99938"}

He never said his name. He was very rude and demeaning said no I will not work with you on this bill, I DONOT care that you are on oxygen, and I DONOT care if you are on disability either. Before this power is put in your name you have to pay 2,223.57 ! Plus a 450.00 deposit. I was in tears the power was on at that point. I begged I even tried to just set up my card that my disability comes on for autopsy for my old bill and new ones. But he was very very rude loud and mean. I cried walking out the door. Very bad. Customer service, not friendly at all. Not understanding of people's disabilities or life situations. An hour after I was home on January the fifth this happened, they came and cut off my power. Knowing everything! In January! Winter. Alabama power is hurtful and hateful! The bill was originally 1490.00 they added all kinds of service fees LTE fees plus turned it over to collec5ions for more fees Wich put it up over 2200.00!

My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift. I called Home Depot and they got the Transport company on the line while I was on hold. I ended up being told the transport company needed to take care of this and they would contact me in 24 to 48 hours. Which they never did. I had to call them. On 3/5 Friday I called central transport and they told me the shipment would be delivered on Monday between 11 and 12. They never showed. I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened. So I wait and wait and I get a call from Home Depot letting me know the tile has arrived at THE STORE.

I get to the store and spoke with someone worker in appliances I ask him again to verify of what I wanted. He walks back and confirms my injury. Rung me up just to realize he mentioned through conversation of the appliance he thought I was asking of. Which I corrected him and pointed out and literally touched again the same appliances that I wanted. Apparently some way some how after all this confusion. They magically had sold out. So my thinking leads me to believe the person I spoke to on the phone didn't bother to check or maybe something with system either way wasted my time and here's the kicker the way the guy tried to put it was like I could go to another home depot after I already paid. Luckily my bank released this debit transaction. Poor poor salesmanship and somewhere along the line communication is lacking. I hope I can revisit this location in the future without this issue.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb240162a2a6b:0xb64868f9b73224ba"}

First, the people who are selling the appliances do not know much about them. I was told that for installation of my microwave, I needed an outlet in the wall that it was being installed on. Great. I'm good. WRONG!!! The outlet had to be above the microwave.... Something that would have been nice to know, but they could not communicate that properly.\nThen, the delivery/installation people had no idea what they were doing. They were more of a delivery company, not an installation professional. They could not install my gas range. They damaged my microwave. So, really, they weren't even a good delivery company. Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!!

I have never even done reviews because it really depends on the day and person every where but this place is HORRIBLE!! First me and my husband bought an entertainment center and had to send it back 3 times for being damaged. The last time there was damage but you couldn\u2019t see it that bad so we just kept it. We should have learned our lesson then!! The next time we bought our daughter a new bedroom suit and we bought a new kitchen table. We knew it was on back order for the bedroom suit but the table would be in sooner. We were called when the table came in set up the delivery time. On the day of Delivery for the table our time was 2-5, at 5 when we had not heard anything I called the store. They gave me a number to call the delivery guys because they said they couldn\u2019t get ahold of their delivery guys. I\u2019m not sure how a customer was supposed to get ahold of the delivery guys before the actually store but I called anyways. Of course no answer. Called the store again and the manager just kept telling me he didn\u2019t know and to have my husband call him. Why do you need to speak with my husband when I\u2019m the one calling?? My husband called and we were finally told they found the truck but we need to reschedule the drop off! Nope we will not we need it today! Me and my husband went to the store and picked it up. We chalked it up to understaffed due to covid and left it at that although still upset the manager will not talk to me only my husband. Now for TODAY! Manger called my husband (although he has my number) told him all the furniture would be in on Tuesday. Rather then wait around on another pointless delivery fail we said we would go in today on Thursday to pick up the furniture. My husband goes in and\u2026. The manager said the furniture is not there and they can\u2019t find it\u2026.. WHAT?!?!? Are you kidding me?!?!? My husband calls me at work at this point I\u2019m done I\u2019m furious I call up there to see what\u2019s going on and the manager says YOUR TO UPSET I CANT TALK TO YOU! I WILL ONLY SPEAK WITH YOUR HUSBAND!!!  I have to call my husband (because I\u2019m at work and can\u2019t go up there and deal with it in person like I would like to) he has to call the store. Blah blah they offered him the furniture on the floor but the dresser is cracked! Are you kidding me no I\u2019m not taking a cracked dresser after all this nor would I take it before all of this.He tells my husband he can come get the bed and nightstand we will have to wait on the dresser of course . We said since that is our only option it will have to do but we will NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER buy from this store and I\u2019m going to corporate about all that has happened and how the manager here has a problem with speaking to woman!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb33dd87097c5:0x750da89af599d5ef"}

Referred someone who could get the job done. Simple, claim stuff. The guy who is replacing our roof observed that the gutters were actually installed wrong and are causing water to sit on my roof AND rotting the wood underneath the shingles. LOWES will not do anything about it because of when they were installed and because they went through a contractor. SMH.

He had no info - not even on the process and we explained we had a bad experience before.

We went in to return a work desk that he had purchased yesterday, only to come home and find out that pieces are broken and missing. When we arrived at the return desk we were greeted angrily by a lady named Shelia (her tag said CSA Front Desk). She was in the process of helping another gentleman with a wheelbarrow at the time we arrived so I shrugged her attitude off as frustration to begin with. By the time she got to us she took the receipt from my husband, asked angrily what was wrong to which he informed her that the desk portion (the main part of the item) was broken down the middle and pieces were missing. She rolled her eyes, mumbled a few things, then started to walk away and as she was walking into another room yelled back at us \"you know it's a clearance item right?!\"  She then came back out of that room, struggled to get the lid off the box and then continued to tell us in a displeasing tone that our kobalt work desk was on clearance. I then stated \"so does clearance mean that pieces are broken? If so, lowes should not be selling clearance items\". She then argued with me that clearance items are usually returns with missing pieces and I restated that the main portion of the item is completely broken in half. I don't care if it's clearance or not, it was not marked down nearly enough to compensate for a complete useless, damaged piece. She then slammed a refund receipt down and asked my husband to sign. She never asked if we wanted to swap it with a usable piece. She never asked anything, actually. During this entire transaction she was rude and everything anyone in customer service should not be. She was also complaining and cussing under her breath about no one answering the phone around there during our entire few minutes with her. When we were leaving there were 2 more men waiting patiently behind us and just staring in disbelief at what they witnessed and would unfortunately encounter. I told one man good luck as we walked off and he said it looked like he needed it.

We went into Aaron's because we are currently renting from them right now. I've rented from them over the years ,and always suggest them to family, and friends. Well we went in there around 3 to see about getting a new bed. We wanted an adjustable base bed. Well after walking in we wasn't greeted until about 5 minutes a lady walks up front and says what are you looking for so we let her know. Instead of her helping us, and generally they order it for you, and give you information on what your looking for. She told us oh you can do that online.. that's it all she said. I said kindly we would like for you to do it so that we can know from A to B what's going on. She just did not want to help us at all she gave us every excuse in the book. Well finally it seemed like she was going to order it for us. Well she went out the front door where the manager he was smoking in his car and said something to him. I don't know what prompted her to even go out there, but she did. Well she comes in and says oh those are on back order.. it was like wow okay! Well can you give us more information? No we don't know when they'll be available.. She was just terrible!!! She was extremely ditzy. She does not know how to work she was rude she is bit made for a customer service job. I can't remember her name I wish I could! But she had blonde curly stringy hair and was talking about her boyfriend and how he could fit on the bed we were looking at. The manager is nasty for smoking right up front and didn't care there was people needing help that's not a manager. I don't know if Charity is still working there, but that's who I've delt with years ago and she was amazing! That's why I came back, but I haven't seen her. Anyways!We went to mattress firm and that lady turned our whole day around after leaving Aaron's. Our bed is awesome, and we got a good price maybe your sucky service was a blessing.

However, I am going to leave the initial review below this update, and raise the stars to a 3 instead of 1. This store really needs to evaluate their customer service skills and improve by taking care of issues in a timely manner.\nInitial Review:\nHorrible experience! Do not shop here! They sold us defective furniture that damaged our hardwood floors and no-one returns the calls. The delivery men were still at my house when I showed them the sofa was reclining and digging into the floors! The sofa reclined and left a deep two-foot-long scratch in our new hardwood floors.
