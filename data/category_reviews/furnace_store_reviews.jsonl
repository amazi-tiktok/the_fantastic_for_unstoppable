The smell was intermittent so I wasn't sure if there was an issue. The first time Sonny came out & took care of the downstairs gas smell.  A few hours after he left the air purifier wasn't working.  Eddie came to our house and fixed and also noticed the \"dryer\" was installed backwards on the both units.
