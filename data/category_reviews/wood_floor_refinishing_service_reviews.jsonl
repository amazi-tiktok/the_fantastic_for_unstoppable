We wanted a somewhat dark gray table to go in our new home, but we were nervous that the white pine dining table couldn't be refinished to match what we wanted and we would have to pay for a brand new table. Nick blew us away with what he was able to do to stain and darken the white pine table. It took him a couple weeks to work on it and us viewing the table's progress.

We called him and received an estimate to refinish an oak table with four chairs and a captain's chair, probably in excess of 25 years old with all the mars and scratches a table of that age would show, not to mention several moves while on active duty in the military.. His estimate was very reasonable, so we asked him to perform the work. To say that we were thrilled with the finished product is an extreme understatement. The set looked better than brand new. We then asked him to do a much harder job, refinishing a hard maple dining room pedestal table and four unmatching chairs (in finish and type of wood) in a stain to match a dining room china cabinet. To make matters even worse, one of the leg bases had been chewed on quite vigorously by a new puppy. Once again, Nick's work was unsurpassed and his estimate was right on. Before and after pictures can be seen on his web page. We are very pleased with his work and wouldn't ever consider anyone else for future work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1488724252521, "text": "Thanks so much for the kind words and for your business, we really appreciate it!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626aabb242d771:0xa0f58e9bffda8d63"}
