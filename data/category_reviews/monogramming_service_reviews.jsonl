I have personally spoken with this customer and explained that there was a misunderstanding that resulted in his impression that the shirts were not here and that he had been misled. My offer to him was and is to do whatever I can to make this up to him, including immediately applying these patches at no cost to the shirts he is purchasing online.

They have had those shirts for two months now and when push came to shove today after asking when the shirts would be printed we were first told by Teresa that their machine broke down and they needed to send out for parts. When I asked them if all five machine broke down at the same time I then received a call back from Carol who said she was the owner and I was told they would not be printing the shirts because they were less than their minimum. Minimum?  I guess that they have no problem with not correcting their mistake. Coincidently I have a copy of there price list and on it states 1 is the minimum so not sure why 22 shirts is less than minimum. I have been in business for 32 years and I value a good vendor that stands behind their work.

I found their smaller store less overwhelming and the choices were very simple.\nOver time, I found these qualities to be the things that caused me to dislike Mainstreet Monograms.\nThe staff is not always pleasant and I have been privy to talk of misused prescription medications by an employee and often have to endure the smell of the lunches they eat at the counter while you order (ew, y'all). And would it kill them to smile or be pleasant?\nHowever, I will say, the owner has always been pleasant and accommodating. It's her business so I guess she's more invested in things running smoothly and making the customer happy. When you are a small business you have to be exemplary and treat your customers well.\nThe final straw came at Christmas this past year. I had purchased ponchos from their store. They were discounted, but again, they came directly from their store.\nI gave them several weeks notice to apply a vinyl adhesive to the ponchos. We talked at length about the application. Heat couldn't be used (it'd melt the ponchos), but they assured me the vinyl would stick. They told me that it was commercial grade vinyl that sticks to cars, mailboxes, and cups - and holds up well for years.\n\nWeeks passed, phone calls were made, and finally I was able to pick up my purchase. Unfortunately, when I came to get them I was appalled at the quality. They were essentially stickers on ponchos. A child could peel them off. When I addressed this with the clerk she was extremely rude and said \"I didn't say they'd stick forever.\"\nI was at a loss. How could someone mess up and then not even apologize???\nFurthermore, this employee had personal knowledge of the family this product/gift was going to. That said, I wish she would have handled the situation with more kindness and professionalism.\nThankfully, the manager swooped in to save the day. She refunded us our money and apologized. We had to scramble to find a replacement Christmas present which was an inconvenience they caused. Managable but very frustrating.\nIn the end, the manager handled it well. But the product was disapointing as was the application. My biggest concern here is who's standing behind the register.\n\nKnow this: Rudeness sticks with people and will keep them away. Consider a possible re-hire or a Dale Carnegie course for your employees. Also, try to make your store more stroller friendly.
