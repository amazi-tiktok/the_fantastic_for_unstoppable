I ordered a tube where i can fit my electrical fish rod tools but to my surprise, the product arrives with no end caps.  All while the product picture has end caps, which is basically false advertisement.  So let me get this straight, your customers are coming to your site to buy an empty tube with no end caps?  I can conveniently drive to home depot and get a random pipe for that.  Or even ask my neighbor.  How about putting it in capital letters on your site  that \"the tube doesn't come with end caps.\"  Then it would be up to the customer to read and do the proper product research.\n\nBut wait there's more.  So i was already super irritated at the lack of logic being used on this one but i refrained from writing a bad review.  Instead, I brushed it off, went on the website, and found I can just order these vynil end caps for $2, plus shipping.  Whatever! Right?  It happens!\n\nBut my disappointment didn't stop there.  I received the package, opened it and only one cap was inside.  Again, the product page is titled \"black vynil caps\" and the first picture is a picture of multiple caps.  So once again, misleading a returning customer that already gave you a second chance.  Where is the logic?  I am certain that you have run into this problem before.  Why is it not fixed.  You risk reputational damage for a few extra bucks.\n\nI just don't understand how your number one priority isn't to make life easier for your customers and delighting them at every step of the sales process....

On the one hand, Anthony, the sales person who I dealt with, is really nice, helpful, knowledgeable, and wants his customers to be happy. On the other hand, there were so many problems with my install, it just seems like things are really disorganized over there and quality control might be a little lacking.\n\nI went to The Car Stereo Shop because my 2005 car didn\u2019t even have an aux port, and I wanted one. But Anthony then informed me I could get a video head unit which would allow me to use Android Auto like a new car can, and that sounded awesome, so I decided to do that instead of just getting an aux port (I wouldn\u2019t really need the aux port since I\u2019d be able to play music with Bluetooth or USB cord). Also, he suggested a speaker upgrade from factory speakers (without being pushy about it at all), and I realized it would be nice to have non-factory speakers for a change. So I ordered an install of the head unit, speakers, and a new Sirius satellite antenna since the old 2005 one wouldn\u2019t work with the head unit.\n\nThen the problems began. For example:\n\n--When I went to pick up the car after the install, the Sirius satellite antenna had never been installed.\n--When i went to pick up the car after the Sirius satellite antenna was installed, the microphone (needed for hands-free phone calls & Android auto commands) no longer worked.\n--When I went to pick up the car after the microphone was fixed, I found a small chunk of my dash had been ripped out during the latest repair.\n--The Sirius radio kept cutting out, and when I asked them about it they said it was just the trees blocking the signal, but finally I was so frustrated I contacted Sirius and they sent me a replacement antenna, and after replacing the antenna the radio didn\u2019t cut out at all so it turns out I was right.\n--Also, there were numerous times when scheduling was difficult or delayed because they were \u201cshort a tech.\u201d They always seemed to be \u201cshort a tech.\u201d\n--Also, the billing system was really disorganized. There were times we\u2019d be looking around for a paper receipt to see how much I had paid them, how much they\u2019d quoted me on price, etc., rather than just looking it up on a computer.\n\nSo the whole process of the install had a lot of issues. BUT, now that the install is done, I am really happy with my new stereo system. And I\u2019m grateful to Anthony for all his advice. He made me aware of potential stereo improvements I hadn\u2019t considered (video screen, Android auto, new speakers), without trying to push stuff on me. Also, the shop did a really nice job crafting custom molds for the Tweeters and installing everything so that it looks natural in the car. And Anthony couldn\u2019t have been nicer about all of the issues I was having with the install and making them right. He was genuinely apologetic about everything and worked really hard to get fixes done as soon as possible.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a new car stereo, I do think it\u2019s worth visiting The Car Stereo Shop and talking to Anthony. He\u2019s great. Just be aware of the potential issues -- who knows, maybe they\u2019ve improved things there by now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2a91e4c1211:0xdbfbe1cc1f0cf71f"}

I sent in a request a request on 5/19/18 to Daivd at outboard repair and salvage for him to honor a receipt for a 200 hp Mercury outboard motor. I had problems with it from day one.  They kept it for over a month and still wasn't fixed. I took it to Steel Creek Marine who is a certified Mercury outboard repair dealer.   They told me that it was not a 200 hp motor but a 150 hp. Big difference.  THAT'S FRAUD. He also said it had major problems and need to be rebuilt.  I have a written statement of the inspection.  So I spoke to David of Outboard Repair and Salvage.  He stated he would replace it.  I dropped of my boat to get the new motor exchanged.   I asked him to please have it fixed by the end of the week.  I called on that Friday and he said he was looking for one.  Then I called several times to see if the boat was ready but I got no answer.  I finally got someone to pic up on Friday 6/30/18. TWO WEEKS LATER!! They said David would have to call me back. He called back and left 2 messages. 1 saying he was still looking for a motor. Another saying that he found one and would have it ready by Monday which was 7/2. I have the recorded messages.  I called to check on it and the secretary now says it will be another week.  Unfortunately I have waited and waited and waited.  ITS NOW 7/21.  There seemes no concern in fixing this problem in a timely manner. I have lost time, money, vacation waiting for this problem to be corrected. I have missed 2 fishing rodeos that tickets were naught for including the Dauphin Island Deep Sea Fishing Rodeo. I have paid for not just tickets for the event but also for my brother I have not seen in 3 years way to get here to fish with him and my dad.

It allows us to provide information to future guests.   I'd like to respond to your \"downsides\".\n\nYes, we collect a $20 deposit on the \"key pass\" to the pool, which is similar to a hotel key to provide safe passageway into the pool for authorized users.  What you failed to mention is that you get that $20 back when you return the key, so you're not out any money.\n\nSecondly, the sites are metered, and tenants are charged .16/kWh for power usage, and one is invoiced anything usage over the $50 allowance.  Anyone is welcomed to monitor their usage by taking note of the meter reading.  It's certainly unfair for a 22' unit to have to pay a higher rent to cover the usage of a 42' unit which has 2 or 3 air conditioner units, therefore, we keep all things even by giving each monthly guest a $50 allowance toward their power.  How they use it is up to the tenant.  You were also here during the summer months when temperatures were extremely high and often record-setting, so yes, you would more than likely have a higher power usage to keep the camper cool.\n\nThirdly, the site you were on is one of our smaller and cheaper sites.  We have larger sites as well.\n\nLastly, we are located next to a scrap yard, and they do move scrap around 6 days a week.  Their weekend noise is no different than during the week.  You must have just been off on the weekends to hear it.\n\nAnd yes, we're continuing to make improvements on the property, including the addition of 21 more sites so we may welcome more guests!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886285bb06e87b7f:0x94a3d5c4ffaec253"}
