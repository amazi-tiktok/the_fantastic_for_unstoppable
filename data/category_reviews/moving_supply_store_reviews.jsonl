Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission. Just be aware.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625061478074, "text": "Hello Mr. Phillis, We're very sorry to learn of your recent move experience.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter. You can reach me at the office @ 251-316-5977 or by email billy.stovall@twomen.com   While we never like to receive poor reviews, we will learn from it and hopefully improve our service to all customers. I appreciate you taking the time to leave it. Billy Stovall - Owner Two Men And A Truck Mobile, AL"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c5600ae3917:0x323715d12942ec3d"}

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter. You can reach me at the office @ 251-316-5977 or by email billy.stovall@twomen.com   While we never like to receive poor reviews, we will learn from it and hopefully improve our service to all customers.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission. Just be aware.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625061478074, "text": "Hello Mr. Phillis, We're very sorry to learn of your recent move experience.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

I went back and reviewed your paperwork and contact logs and I wanted to hopefully clear up some items for you. All of our trucks are 26 feet in length. While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter. You can reach me at the office @ 251-316-5977 or by email billy.stovall@twomen.com   While we never like to receive poor reviews, we will learn from it and hopefully improve our service to all customers.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know.

I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan.

Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.

Going inside and asking just nets you excuses (\"broken machine\", \"don't have anyone who can do that right now\", etc.). I get that the trucks are the money makers, but if you offer a service, have a plan for it. Set specific propane hours, train your maintenance crews on how to use the machine, or something else.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197e84af1c55:0xf5fc42f4ad17911e"}

Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge.

I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626d1442a93003:0x7d8a498adb157034"}

I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...   Finally, at the end of the transaction I thanked him and stretched out my hand and he refused to shake it. Mr. Hall has a chip on his shoulder that needs to be challenged. I remain unhappy with your service. In the past I have rented storage space for 6 months, rented vehicles to move but that business will go elsewhere. I will be needing storage again but another company that can do the job correctly, that doesn't have an attitude that they were doing me a favor by poor quality work...that other company will get my business.

The property is full of spiders. One or two spiders is expected for an outside unit BUT 10+ spiders inside unit is unacceptable for a unit I've only had a couple of months. That shows lack of pest control or even Raid! I have spoken with several employees, multiple times, at this location about pest issue and requested for their DM  (Nathan) to call me which as yet to happen even though they noted in my file several times for him to call me. I've been complaining for weeks. They have also decided to increase the storage rental an extra $22 ( I've only had the unit 6 months and according to the fine print, they can increase every 6 months if they choose to). Employees have openly complained to me about management and company and how they hate working for Public Storage (I have the recordings). Unethical and poor company values. If i was not out of state on a job assignment, i would've moved my property months ago! The ONE star is for the employees who work onsite because they all were helpful even though they have no control or say over any issue. And I wonder if they are offered the people below me some type of incentive for a \"5 star\" review?!? More than likely. Save yourself and your property the stress/insects, and CHOOSE ANOTHER STORAGE COMPANY! ~~~Update~~~ Nathan, DM, finally decided to call me. Ironically. He informed me that they have Orkin pest control which comes monthly and that maybe the location of my unit is why I have a MAJOR spider issue. He refused to provide me w/ a date of last service from Orkin. According to him, it would be too much of an hassle to go through the paperwork to find invoice. Really?!? His advice is that i consider moving allllll my property to a different unit which isn't near trees. Really?!?! Sooooo, after some prompt investigation and people I know, I have a invoice showing where Orkin last serviced the property in Sept. 2015 and this review was written on July 2016.... ALMOST A YEAR AGO SINCE THEY HAD ANY PEST CONTROL SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Go figure, huh?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec22431fc29:0x1d63d592c911fe8f"}

My grandson graduated high school and was offered a full scholarship at Auburn University. As an average family we made the decision to rent my home and I would move in with my daughter and assist with getting him through college. So I packed up my most precious belongings and searched for a climate controlled unit for myself. The staff were most helpful and assisted me in getting an end unit so that I could get to my things easily if needed. Being a single woman and trusting your entire life being put into storage can be so stressful. However Ashley has been great, her kind words and helpful attitude have made me feel comfortable about leaving my life of independence and helping to write a new chapter in life for my grandson. I certainly hope that IStorage knows what a wonderful employee they have in Ashley. I would not hesitate to recommend this facility to anyone for their storage needs. I still have 2 more years to go before I can once again be independent and I can do that with no worries\nThank you so much Ashley !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286a6c9aad44f:0x78be7047b6726e8a"}

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.  Plus you can get an additional 5% discount if you have a Home Depot credit card.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

They called us on a Friday to say our furniture could be delivered Monday.  In the voicemail, the company rep kept calling my husband Michelle, when his name is Michael. When she realized halfway through the message that she made a mistake, she said\u2019 \u201cI think it\u2019s supposed to be Michael and not Michelle...anyway...\u201d No apology or anything. When we called to reschedule because we were out of town, the same rep said she would call us back with a new time and day. She never did. We called three times before actually getting someone on the phone. Same rep informed us it would be delivered Tuesday at 12/ noon. Okay. Great. So, Tuesday at noon rolls around, and no one is here. We waited until 1:30 before calling to check the status, to which we got nothing but the voicemail multiple times. When my husband finally got someone on the phone, the same rep informed us that our furniture was scheduled for delivery on Wednesday, not Tuesday. Clearly my husband was upset since we rearranged our schedules and paid extra to keep my daughter in daycare. So, she says our furniture will be delivered Wednesday at 12. Because we had issues with times, I decided to call to make sure it was set for 12, and the same rep, very rudely, began arguing with me about what she said the day before and the times. I was trying to get an estimated time, and she kept interrupting me, and she finally hung up. At this time, I was livid with the situation and called back. Here\u2019s where the actual good part comes in. Said rep hands the phone to the company owner, who was extremely helpful. He listened without interrupting and sympathized with the situation. He informed me that delivery times are always approximately due to problems or delays with other scheduled deliveries and we would see our furniture between 12-4 on Wednesday. It was delivered before 12 the next day in great condition.\n\nThe reason why I am giving this company a 2 star instead of higher is solely bc of the rude and unprofessional receptionist.  She independently will run the company into the ground if she continues to act with other clients the way she did with us. I believe this company is a \u201cmom and pop\u201d family business, so I doubt she\u2019ll be going anywhere.

Looked at all reviews for long distance movers and found that Armstrong had the best consistent reviews. Had a virtual assessment and they came up with a Binding contract for the weight of my mother belongings. They packed about 3 dish packs, 8 picture boxes,two TV's and a few other boxes.I packed about 20 boxes. One bed, one loveseat, headboard,desk, dinning room table, couch and two occasional chairs. The apartment was a 2 BR\n1400sf apartment. No washer dryer or refrigerator. The estimate was 7000 lbs which seemed high but I TRUSTED their evaluation based on the reviews. On arrival the driver stated that the weight was more like 4000 lbs. In my eyes that is a significant discrepancy. When asked for the final payment of 6900 dollars I mentioned this to the coordinator. The owner of the company called and said the estimate was Binding. I agreed that I had indeed agreed to a Binding estimate but it seemed wildly over inflated. His response was that I had signed the contract and I could have gotten other estimates. Really not the point but he seemed to be incapable of understanding my point. Therefore my 85 year old mom payed the bill. Otherwise the move was average. The Packers spent most of the time on their phones. The driver was prompt and coutrtious and took great care to wrap my belongings. Took a few days to wipe down all furniture and get the smell of smoke off furniture....not uncommon. Drivers shouldn't smoke in cabin but I don't know how that can be controlled.

He packed our garage, and, when they were preparing to leave, I opened the door to find that he'd left many items in there. Even his co-worker was displeased with his actions.\n\nOur belongings were in storage for about two weeks while we closed on our new home. The men who unloaded them were very good- friendly, thorough, and careful.\n\nUnfortunately, several items had been poorly packed and were broken upon arrival- a chair, bookshelves, fragile items. They had thrown our Christmas tree topper into a box, and then threw heavy tools on top of it. They wrote our tracking number directly *on* some of our furniture with black permanent marker!\n\nWorst of all, they LOST a small trunk that contained heirlooms and family memorabilia. We didn't have room for it in our vehicle, and I was assured it would reach our new location safely. Well, it didn't.\n\nWhen we called to report the missing and broken items, we received no compassion, no apology. No effort was made to find the missing trunk. The representative assigned to us was curt, and behaved as if we were wasting his time. He just emailed us a claim form, and told us to value the missing items for reimbursement.\n\nHow am I supposed to place a value on my children's locks of hair, the bible my great-grandfather gave me before he died, my high school yearbooks and photos, the stuffed Fox my oldest daughter slept with every night? They're literally irreplaceable!\n\nWe ended up with a check to replace the broken furniture. I would never, ever recommend this company to anyone.

Not all of our moves have been pleasant and resulted in high stress, damaged goods and higher moving costs in the end.  However, my family and I have recently had a totally different experience with Armstrong Relocation & Companies.\nIn preparation for the move, three moving companies were contacted for quotes.  Brad Murphy came to our house on two separate occasions, the first to ascertain our moving needs and the second to adjust the initial quote to ensure the accuracy of our moving estimate.  The initial quote was actually reduced to reflect the adjustment in estimated weight.  The quote provided was a \u201cnot to exceed\u201d amount, giving me and my family reassurance of no surprises at the end of our move.\nFrom the initial planning stages throughout the entire process, we received world-class service and support from all employees at Armstrong Moving, particularly Brad Murphy with coordination of our move, Justin who oversaw the pick-up and delivery, and Michelle, the outstanding receptionist who left her post at the front desk on three occasions to help us load packing materials at the loading dock.  All employees consistently went beyond all expectations to support us prior to and during our move.  All of our household items, including very fragile materials and heavy shop equipment were moved with extraordinary care and arrived to our new home without one scratch or any damage.   All deadlines and schedules were accurately met with ongoing communications from representatives throughout our moving process.  I truly hope Brad Murphy and the Armstrong Relocation & Companies are available if another move is needed in the future.  Without hesitation, I will go the Armstrong way once again.   Thank you for a JOB WELL DONE!\n\nD. Brigman,\nRentz, GA", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862654be1b3d249:0xb58f475e3022567a"}

The explanation given by the customer service representative Nyrie was, \"We try to tell people not to leave food in their unit. It probably came from another unit.\" Today I went in to close out my account and was told that although I was closing my account out today December 5, 2017 I would be charged until the end of the month. Originally I was told that the amount would be prorated however was later told that they no longer prorate because their competitors do not prorate. I followed up with the district manager Jennifer Sanders and was told that unless I kept my personal lock on the unit they would rent the unit out to someone else although I was charged for the remainder of december, which I must say I find inappropriate.

Wrecked half a day. Asked for a full refund. Asked for the manger and he yelled at me, saying \u201cwe call you when ready\u201d. I asked was it complete and he yelled \u201cdoes it have a hitch on it?\u201d  He didn\u2019t know or care and walked outside to see. I asked for the contact info of his manager.

Now that I live in Foley AL, I called Two Men in a Truck's Foley location to set up a local move.  I went in to the office and spoke with the manager  Katelyn who told me I would only need one truck and two men, based on the fact that I have a one bedroom apartment.  She also told me that a week day is a much cheaper rate.  So I agreed and scheduled a day off work and set up my move for a Wednesday.  I paid the deposit of $125.00 which I was told would come off of my balance due after the move.  Within 10 minutes of leaving the office, I received a phone call from Crystal out of Mobile, AL.  She told me that there would be no way that two men could move me with one load in under 8 hours and to save time and money I need to increase to three men.  After my hesitation but her persistence and pressure, I agreed (bumping my hourly rate up to $165.00 from $125.00 I originally agreed to).  So Wednesday my move day came.  I received a phone call from the driver who said \"we are leaving the lot and we are 2 minutes away\"  which is absolutely true the lot is approximately 3 miles from my storage unit.  They arrived, loaded me up (the truck was barely half full) and went to my new residence which is a 5 mile drive and unloaded.  They were finished in less than 5 hours.  I completed the transaction on the tablet the driver had and paid my balance due.  Within 5 minutes of paying and the movers leaving I once AGAIN received a phone call from Crystal out of Mobile, AL who tells me that the GPS in the truck miscalculated the time and distance and I owe an additional $185.00.  My total bill for a 5 hour local move ended up costing me over $1,100.  RIDICULOUS  !\nI feel very ripped off by this company and by Crystal who twice contacted me to increase the amount of money I owe. I ended up paying for more than 5 hours plus the deposit (which got bumped up to $165) suddenly became travel costs and costs for the materials to wrap my furniture.  My receipt stated that the drivers came from Mobile, AL an hour's drive away.  Another rip off from this company.\nOnce I was in my apartment I realized that two pieces of my furniture were damaged.  Not one piece of my furniture was ever wrapped - even though I was charged for quilts and pads.  The young men that moved me were not professional in their moving abilities and how to take careful care of furniture and especially boxes marked fragile.\nSo after many many many phone calls I did have a headboard replaced, but my phone calls regarding my dining room table damages have been avoided.\nThis company is a poor reflection on Two Men and a Truck corporation.  This franchise is a money trap and so unprofessional.  It's a shame that the people in my area who have been displaced by a hurricane would be taken advantage of by a local moving company.  I will never use this location or franchise again and will make sure that I tell everyone I know in southern Baldwin County who need a mover to AVOID Two Men and a Truck Mobile, AL / Foley, AL", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625068008713, "text": "We are sorry that you had a bad experience.

Upon leaving my son\u2019s property, they ran into a newly installed security gate, about three weeks old, scraping it, jamming into the ground, damaging a post and the monitor, bending the metal on the gate, then left without a word. My son walked down to close the gate and discovered the damage. This company has said that they are not obligated to file insurance claims and felt they were not at fault AFTER the driver told them it happened!! After much talking, pleading this company sent my son a check for $500 for a $3200 gate. They finally agreed to hire a contracror to install, billing to be taken care of by Two Men and a Truck. The contractor worked for two days, demanded money from my son, left, never came back. NOW , the contractor says that the company will not pay him so he is threatening my son with a lien for $3200.  The contractor\u2019s work was not correct and workers are now correcting his work. My son did not hire this man. SO my question is, why does the contract that I signed state that damages caused by workers will be corrected at no cost to me as mistakes do happen??  Contractually, Two Men and a Truck have not honored  the contract that I signed in good faith.

The previous day on the 1st I spoke to the manager on-site.  She was very nice and very customer service friendly.  I spoke about vacating my space so I wouldn\u2019t be charged for another month.  It didn\u2019t seem like a problem, she mentioned coming to get her when I was  finished, and I even made mention that I may not be done that day.  I was told no problem.  I came to the office on the 2nd at 10:00 am, let her know I was out, it swept clean and empty.  I then at that time asked if the auto-debit would still go through on my account as has been done religiously for 2 years, she said yes but that the pro-rates refund amount would be returned in approximately 5-7 days.  Today is a week and a half later, I tried to contact the site, spoke with an extremely rude customer service rep (NOT the on-site staff for clarification), and after with the District Manager Jordan. I was informed that I would not be receiving any money back as the rent is month to month and nothing would be done-however when I moved in I was pro-rated for days then? That it was policy....I fully understand that, I deal with policy every day-I am also have a responsibility to act fairly and not hide beyond policy and take care of my customers.  When I asked specifically (and while in the office ON THE 1st) when I would receive the difference back-that would have been the time to be upfront, transparent and honest about the truth about the intent to not refund the remaining days on my unit.  If I would have not been told a refund was coming I would have stayed the month-and not called regarding my pro-rated refund.  If that wasn\u2019t what I was told why would I be calling? Bottom line here, I moved up the street to Extra Space Storage, rented the same size unit for $18/month.  I was paying Public Storage $89 after 3 increases over 6 mos.  for the same size unit.  At this day in age a simple apology for the miscommunication and an effort to reimburse me something would have been appreciated and seen as compromise, the lack of an attempt to make it right is unacceptable to me.  It\u2019s not the $89 at this point it\u2019s the principal of managing my expectations as a consumer.  Please go up the street to Extra Space Storage, who were very decent about not wanting to steal their customer by the way, business is business.  The pro-rated refund would have been easier at this point instead of a negative google review and friends that also rent there and now will know to relocate.  Hope it was worth it, I do plan to make further calls.  At this point I do want my money over the principal of standing up for myself and what is right.  By the way, I work for a large property management company in town and in 2 other states that I travel, we were using Public Storage on our marketing material for new move-ins to our apartments and giving them this location in just Birmingham.  That will be changing.  Hiding beyond policy is one thing, refusing to see your company miscommunicated and screwed up is another.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922751385a587:0x11a09201c8c5123b"}

My daughter had been quoted $108 per hour with a minimum of 2 hours. The guys were very personable and polite.  Upon arrival, I asked that they move a 1 couch, 2 chairs, and 1 recliner to a space in the basement.  Because I knew that this was in addition to the task of the move that they were hired for, I full well expected to pay whatever the charge for this additional work. They\u2019d arrived at my daughter\u2019s apartment at 8am and presented me with the contract at 10:08am...2 hours and 8 minutes.  Seeing that the charge was $378, I inquired if the extra had been to move the other items.  To my surprise the young man told me that there was no additional charge, as we were being charged by the hour.  I then asked if that were the case, why were we charged almost double the contracted 2 hours.  He nicely explained that they charge from the time that they leave their office until they arrive back at the office and then there is a charge for cleaning the vehicle.  It felt like I was being fleeced but I did not object, considering that they\u2019d moved the other items.  I paid and provided a $50 tip for each of them and before going on their way, the young man with the paperwork asked that I please provide them a review on GOOGLE...Well here it is...After going down to the basement, I was beyond appalled and unsettled by the haphazard an uncaring manner that they left the items that they moved for me.  Both chars thrown above the couch, the cushions were scattered about the floor and the recliner had been taken apart.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why these items were placed in this manner,  It took more work to disassemble and place them in such disarray, that it would have to place them in a neat order.  Further, when my husband arrived home, he located the handle for the recliner in the street.  In all honesty, I fault myself for not going down into the basement while they were there.  I just never could have imagined that this is how they left things, especially after being asked to write a review. Just so we\u2019re clear...I would never use or recommend this moving company.

While I am a college student I wanted a place to store my items to make my appartment a happy livable space. Today I went to store 8477 and met a very lovely associate named April Goodman and while  I was there she treated me not only as a customer, but it welt like during the our time felt like family. When I asked to see the 5' by 7' we looked at the unit and it was not something i was looking for. However when she suggested a 5' by 15' we needed to walk to the very far building on the property to view the unit. Ms. April recommended the golf cart. I told her we did not need to use it since it is a beautiful day out and it would be a nice walk to get exercise. As walking down I told her I might not like the 15' size and asked about the 5' by 8' and that it was the last one available and that we needed to walk back to the main building to see it. As we were walking to the last building she asked if I still wanted to see the 15 footer and I asked her please. When we walked back to the 5 by 8 room I walked in it and i felt in love with the space that it had its own light and also own air vent. I told her it was sold and we went back to the office and did all the paper work and I am now renting a air controlled 5' by 8' and so far I love it. As I was loading my unit an hour ago I loaded a car load in the unit then walked to the office to ask a question. As I opened the door to the office I was looking into the office smiling and as I was walking in Ms. April's office phone rang and Ms. Lechelle in the desk right next to her asked me how can i help you. As I was walking in I did not notice Ms. Lechelle asking me that question. So as I continued walking into the office Ms. Lechelle rudely asked me how may I help you. I asked my question and left the office not happy with the tone she was talking to me in as a paying customer. I do not appresiate that at all. Next time I go to the office to get help I will only make sure that I only ask miss april for help no matter if there are 2 people in the office or if she is off I will only work with her. Overall I love the facility and I would gladly recommend it to my friends and family if they ever need any storage rooms. But because of the rude experience I will only rate this 4 stars!!!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1575824202100, "text": "Hi Kyle, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

However, the man helping us said that we should have come inside (where not a single employee was masked) if we wanted the truck. We understand that this situation may not have been this individual\u2019s fault, but his behavior made our situation even more distressing, as he was quite rude, even belligerent, and made no attempt at an apology for this very disruptive mistake.\n\nThis mixup has made our lives very difficult, and we were sorely disappointed in the employee\u2019s attitude toward us. In the future, we will not be using Uhaul, and from now on we will be warning others about this.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2b9070996ed:0x897226dde07c4dad"}

I saw it only when I opened the back to load my stuff.  I was surprised, to say the least and wondered if I will be billed for it. Guess what?  I was billed for it even though I had not used it. And how did he know that I had used it? When I called this morning, he told me that the plastic tab that was attached to the dolly was broken. When I try to assure him that I had not even touched the dolly, his response was rude and something like \"we have a lot of customers who say they didn't use the dolly but they actually did.\" In short, he had just accused me of lying!  My question is: why was the dolly even there in the first place? I had not reserved it!  And if there was something in the back of the truck, he should have opened the back and shown it to me.  I would have asked for the dolly to be taken out. Further, how do I know that tab wasn't broken before the truck keys were handed to me? So, this was a clear case of an attempt to cheat a customer.

He was completely unwilling to make up for the fault of his company in any capacity and did nothing but sit there and act annoyed at our frustration. I dropped by one last time to use the restroom and I could hear them quoting us and laughing at our situation until they saw I had come in. I was so disgusted at their attitude about their job that I marched up to the desk to get Mr. Scott's full name to write in this report, to which he replied, laughing \"You can just look up my name if you need it.\" I replied \"take care\" and he replied \"oh I will take care\" and continued to murmur something under his breath to the amusement of his coworkers.

Coach was very professional in his dealings with us and completely explained how everything worked from the hours to the helpful hints on getting the proper size for our \"stuff.\" I also liked  how clean the entire place was and the rolling carts were a lifesaver in getting the heavy boxes we had to put in our unit. We are very pleased with our choice to move from the \"other\" place down the road, just North of where we are now. Additionally, Uncle Bob's has a pretty neat and simple web site you can use to help you remember little things like, when your payment is due. Doesn't hurt to have a little reminder occasionally, you know. Oh, and the Coach is a big time football fan, too.

I relocated from Alabama to Georgia and used this company to move some of my belongings into a pod. Well, the movers that arrived were not prepared to move much of the items they were to move. Because I was in Georgia, my realtor agreed to oversee the move. She called me stating that the guys were cramming things in the pod haphazardly and was certain that many of the items would be damaged as they didn't bring any supplies to wrap or disassemble the items(e.g. Exercise mirror, bowflex treadmill). They were willing to scratch up the paint on my walls bringing the fully assembled gym equipment out of the room because they were not equipped with tools.\n\nThey finally agreed to go to the office building to get tools to bring back. So, what was to be a three hour move turned into an EIGHT HOUR move.\n\nLastly, my realtor told the head crew member to leave the key in the opened lockbox when they were done with the move. She wasn't able to stay on site for eight hours. The guys agreed to do so. She texted them about 30 minutes after they'd left the house, askin if they'd left the key in the lock box as instructed. The mover stated that he did NOT plave the key in the box but that he'd left the key under the mat on the front porch(below the OPENED lockbox). When she asked why he didn't leave the key in the lockbox, the mover responded, there's nothing we can do about it now, we've left.\n\nThe next morning the appraiser came to the home and the key was NOT under the mat. So, I had to reschedule my home inspection and pay a locksmith to change my locks. Especially since I still had a zero turn mower(10k), golf cart and other valuables still in my home that my husband was coming back to remove a couple days after they moved the items.\n\nI really feel their plan was to come back with the key and remove some of my belongings from the home. Why else would they agree to place the key in a lock box that was already \"opened\" and located above the mat they claimed they placed the key under. Makes no sense.\n\nSo, I decided to write a review. Only after trying to reach out to the owner several times about the issue of the key and never receiving a response. I did speak with the Operations manager and he was very nonchalant and rude. My realtor and I were both on the line and he wouldn't allow either of us to speak on the issues. He was very defensive and talked over us the entire time.\n\nI ended the call thinking, the most I can hope for is that my equipment in the pod isn't damaged when it arrives to Georgia and to just be grateful I changed my locks before whomever made it back with the key they \"wilfully failed\" to place in the opened lock box just above the mat they claimed they placed the key under.\n\nI truly encourage anyone searching for a moving company to please find another one. Moving is stressful enough. The last thing you need is to work with a company who's unprofessional and lack common decency and respect in servicing their clients. I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923a491073409:0x2725981c1fcf7a1e"}

We started at 9:00am and they did not leave our home till 11:30pm. A lot of our furniture was scratched and our walls were hit. My husbands gun came up missing and we found the gun case thrown behind our deep freezer. They busted our 60inch tv. We told them we would pay half that night and we would settle up with the owner the next day because of our experience. My husband said make sure you have him call me. The next day we heard nothing. My husband called 4 times and emailed 2. The owner did not call him for 3 days. Then he said he would look into it. He got one of his employees to call my husband back and tell him they were going to send a company out to repair our furniture. The furniture company called and my husband ask how exactly they go about repairing the furniture and they said with a furniture pen \ud83e\udd14. Umm no thanks. My husband tried to call him back multiple times. The owner never handled business and we have heard nothing from him! This all happened on April 30th.

On the phone and through our various email exchanges they sounded as if they were genuinely interested in our business!  Not only did Mr. Devri Hensley II ensure us that a crew would be there, he promised to maintain an open flow of communication with us, so we\u2019d know what to expect.\nThe only problem with all of this was that they didn\u2019t show up on the agreed upon date and time. Then we had another problem. No response. None whatsoever. Our numerous calls and voicemails have gone unanswered, ever since.\nNow, since they have still failed to call us back or provide explanation, I\u2019ll ask the questions here with hopes of getting some sort of response below:\nFirst, why have you done this to us? It was pretty awful having to call friends and family, last minute, to help us move, quickly. (They appreciate you too, by the way.) We would have simply tried another moving company if you had only said something along the lines of, \u201cNo sir, we can\u2019t move you that day, we\u2019re booked full.\u201d Or if there were another reason that made sense, maybe we could have understood. After all, we consider ourselves pretty understanding. But not now.\nWhy won\u2019t you return our phone calls and emails? We understand stuff happens, but you\u2019re running a business. Now you\u2019ve just made yourself look completely and utterly incompetent. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for, because it seems to be, then congratulations!\nAnd lastly, I have to ask, why did you decide to open this business? Sometimes it\u2019s okay to admit when you\u2019re wrong. Maybe you should reconsider this.\nBut in all seriousness, unless you like being suddenly caught in overly-anxious situations, I\u2019d suggest everyone steer clear of Easy Moves.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923a491073409:0x2725981c1fcf7a1e"}

You can tell a lot about a place during the move-in and move-out processes. This place is the best. I also learned that the humidity in the Madison Alabama area is not good for cardboard boxes. Stacked cardboard boxes began to fail over time. I do recommend the tough storage tote bins from Home Depot. They hold up well and can be stacked to the ceiling. You can seal the tote bins with Ty-wraps and large moving companies will take them without an issue. The plastic tote bins also do well if it decides to rain on moving day like it did on mine. Of course, I always recommend being a good steward of the rental space keeping it clean and reporting any issues (none for me).

I confirmed my lease was ended twice with a public storage employee and that I did not need to do anything else, I was payed up, and they proceeded to pass off my \"bill\" for another month to a debt collector. Lower management was initially helpful and confirmed that I did indeed vacate long before they said I did, and he was going to fix the issue, but then he saw it had gone to collections and there was nothing he could do with that. So he gave me the contact information for management out of Birmingham, and they never returned my calls. She answered once and the call dropped or something? And I could never get her to answer again. My fiance and I used their advertised discounts on our first two months, and ended the lease before the outrageous increase on rent the third month. We couldn't afford their regular rates. What I do know is that the company did yet again refuse to correct their mistake when I refuted the charge with the debt collector. My next step will be to pursue legal action if I can. Hopefully I do have enough proof that I did reach out and end my lease. They have hurt my credit and charged me for a space that I cancelled. Their discounts in the beginning are nice, but they will absolutely charge you for whatever they decide to. When you cancel your lease, they might simply just have \"forgotten to write it down\" and then refuse to fix it. I wish I could press charges.

I was also told all furniture was off the truck when I discovered my bedroom nightstand was missing.  I found this and a busted chest of drawers with clothes spread out under blankets so I would not find them. Brads response was for me not to worry about it that he\u2019d take care of me.\nAll boxes, TV\u2019s, and hanging clothes were moved independently.  They were strictly moving furniture.\nI did everything I was instructed to do to file my claim and have yet to hear back from the insurance company.

I have never written a negative Yelp/Google review, BUT I have also never been treated so poorly (thank you Nate) as a paying customer of a business. We booked with All My Sons for our Saturday move a few weeks in advance. My husband spoke to MULTIPLE different reps, male and females, confirming that movers would be at our house at 8:00am. On the day of our move, we got a call saying, \u201cthe crew never showed up\u201d and they were going to be late. 9:00am rolls around, and we get another call saying they won\u2019t be there until 9:45am. Frustrated that we have now lost 2 hours of moving time (moves are already high-stress to begin with without the added frustration of movers not showing), I call the office to express my concerns. Enter the ever-so-lovely \u201cNate\u201d, who I HOPE does not have a \u201cManager\u201d title to his name. If so, you should seriously reconsider. Argumentative, rude, arrogant\u2026the list goes on. Nate probably needs a refresher in Customer Service 101, \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d. Nate tells me that their moves start from \u201c8-10am\u201d, so \u201ctechnically\u201d they weren\u2019t late and \u201cno one would have told us they were going to be there by 8am\u201d. I explained that we spoke with MULTIPLE people and that was not the case\u2026.we were assured they would be there at 8am. After a few LOVELY back and forths with this Nate character, he says, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m cancelling your move and you can find someone else.\u201d\n*Click*\nHe hangs up the phone. If you are the owner of All My Sons, please know that you have someone representing your business in the POOREST way. I have already submitted a complaint to the BBB. This business needs to be INVESTIGATED and management needs to be reevaluated. My experience is NO WAY to treat a paying customer. Cancelling someone\u2019s day-of service because they receive a VALID complaint is beyond me and I hope there are repercussions for Nate treating people the way he does. Based on Google/Yelp reviews, this is not an isolated incident.  Luckily, the bright spot in the day was calling MOVEDADDY who completely rearranged their moving schedule to accommodate us and did so with the most POSITIVE attitude. And they were $50+ less expensive/hour. SO all-in-all crisis averted in doing business with All My Sons, and I\u2019m glad they did not get a PENNY of my money.

Talked to several movers before deciding on AMS. In house estimator was on time and thorough. We walked down the move and discussed site conditions and options to overcome any challenges (mainly very steep and long drive). AMS still had the best price.\nOn the day of the move, Josh and the guys were right on time. Unfortunately for them, the drive was so steep that the truck bound against the concrete even when empty. They parked the truck on the road and came in to walk down the move.\nThe guys really needed a smaller truck to shuttle things down a long steep drive. After talking among themselves, they determined the move had to take place and promptly began to wrap and carry things to the truck parked on the street.\nAn hour into the move came the 560# gun safe which they gang tackled and rolled with the aid of only a set of hand trucks. It wasn\u2019t easy. But, the task was completed without incident.\nThese guys were great!\nThe delivery was much easier and just as professional.\nThis was the first of a two part move. They will be doing the next move as well. Hopefully with a truck that can handle the driveway.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ede3ecc47dd:0x6e0df98ae12a8cda"}

Save yourself the aggravation and money, GO WITH SOMEONE ELSE!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ede3ecc47dd:0x6e0df98ae12a8cda"}

I use to work for this company but after all I've seen I wouldn't call all my son's to help move your family.

I've seen so much circus acts at all my son's. The workers getting in fist fights and even taking it across the street. They run their business like a drama soap opera. Not to mention the management forming favorites and even having affairs with employees. Theirs also \"gang\" members that work here and they keep it all in the family. When I worked for all my son's my best friend was going to use them and I told him to ask for me and my dad (my \"dad\" works there what I mean by \"keeping it all in the family\") and when my friend couldn't get me to cover his job because of unknown reasons I told him to just use another moving company because you will be disappointed and better off moving your own things or calling another company that cares. All my son's doesn't care about a good portion of jobs because the workers have 2 0r 3 jobs a day and they either hurry up and damage things or they milk the clock and overcharge on materials.

This time, this was a local move.  It was an easy move for the movers as well.  I had already taken most of our things, but I hired All My Sons to move a few dressers, an fridge, washer, dryer, and a couple of game tables.  We also had a large piece of furniture in storage.  But, they didn't have to move beds, clothes, dishes, etc.  The move should have taken about 2-3 hours.\n\nMy move was scheduled to start at 8am.  At 7:45am, I received a call that due to DOT requirements, the driver could not arrive until 10-10:30am.  I get it.  I work with DOT every day.  But this was poor scheduling and the last-minute notice wasn't pleasing, but I was willing to let it slide.  But the driver did not arrive until 11:45am.  I had an important appointment at 2pm that day.  I told the driver we needed to get moving.  He replied saying his boss called him at 10am wanting to know if he could work.  Now, I finally know the truth.\n\nAt first, the guys were moving well.  They loaded up the house in about 35 minutes.  I was pleased.  Then we dropped by our storage unit and the driver was more interested in looking at our pictures or checking out our motorized toys.  At this point, I knew he was dragging his feet and running up the clock.  They finished the move in about 4.5-5 hours.  We were moving to a new home that we built.  They scratched the staircase in two places pretty severely.\n\nI spoke to the supervisor and told him about my complaints.  He asked me what I was looking for.  I told him I would leave the resolution up to him, but I knew if I ran my business with this type of communication and lack of urgency, I would lose my customers.  He responded, \"Well, you were moved today and the guys have to get paid.\"  So, I paid, but I promised myself I would leave reviews everywhere I could.  I was completely disappointed.\n\nThe response below seems to be the same cut and paste response issued by All My Sons to every negative review.

There was some sticky residue on there. I said okay and cleaned the dresser.  I went back to sit down. I noticed they had packed my TV and I needed it because Direct TV was headed to the new location. My friend was coming to pick it up the TV.  I went to the truck to get the TV.

We are getting ready to move you. \"I suppose what I said led to what happened next\"  She sent  the African American guy into my town house to let me know they had to CANCELED my move today.  I guess because I was African American that was the reason for sending him. He had no explanation. I asked since she was the manger why didn't she come and tell me what the problem was and why my move was canceled.  He said she a White lady. In other words, he was sent to do the dirty work! By this time I am furious! I call the office and some gentleman couldn't really explain either. He just said it was cancelled. I used some unprofessional words and hung the phone up. I called back to speak to her and she stated that there was no room for their dollies to pass through, there was an odor and it was not clean. All of those were lies! I don't know any place that will be clean when you are moving.  I had all of my boxes and bags in one  location. They were labeled and separated.  The only items upstairs were the bedrooms. I used some more unprofessional , choice words again! My issue with the entire thing is NO ONE explained to me how to set up for the move or came our prior for a walk through. SHE told me that was COMMON SENSE! I gave some more unprofessional , choice words.  I live in a town house which does not have a lot of room. I can not help how many items I had. I did contact corporate office and explained EVERYTHING! I even expressed that I used unprofessional words and I did apologize to the corporate office.  Thank God I have awesome family and friends!!! They moved me with no hesitation and never complained. What about the people who don't have family and friends in the city!  Treat people how you want to be treated!  KARMA is for real!!!!  SO WHO EVER READS THIS DON'T EVER USE THESE RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL, SMOKE BREAK PEOPLE IF YOU CAN HELP IT!!!!!

The pricing is super straight forward, and the  is charged by a flat by the hour fee, with no hidden costs - it made it easy to help budget. I then received a follow up call from the local team that would be handling my move, personally introducing themselves and making sure I didn't have any additional questions.  However, the move day itself is actually what floored me... this was no easy move, I was downsizing my parents from a 4 bedroom house with a basement full of stuff to a two bedroom apartment - so the move involved a LOT of stuff and several stops (between storage and the new place).  Quinton (the driver) and his team (Quinteze, Jamaul and Colin) showed up right on time, moved quickly and efficiently, and never once acted like anything was a problem! They really went above and beyond, even taking items that we planned to give away down to the basement for us. These four guys were so nice and helpful, and really made what was a tough and challenging move for me, seem easy!  I cannot recommend this team and the company high enough - I will use them for ANY move I plan in the future.

Which chose to hire movers because we just completed renovations and wanted to avoid causing damage to our newly renovated house. They told my wife they had an early morning opening and a late morning opening. We chose the later option because of our work schedules. They showed up an hour earlier than we expected and we were not prepared. The staff was nice  and they did not waste anytime getting loaded. When I arrived to the house my wife was disappointed. When we called AMS to arrange the move we asked them if they could assemble some items. My wife was told they disassembled and assembled. When my wife showed the men the items she was told her they would only assemble what they had previously disassembled at the pickup. It might have been a misunderstanding on our end, but I'm not sure why it would be a problem since they charge by the hour. The most disappointing part was the damages caused to our house. We know these men are working hard and furniture can be difficult to move through hallways and doors so we expected minor scratches/dents might  occur, but in two places the damage was beyond what I would call minor. The casing on the front door and one of the hallways has chunks of wood taken out of them.  While we still would have been annoyed.. If we had we been notified during the move we would have let it go. Nobody said anything about the damages and now we will have to make repairs to work that was just completed.

I contacted them less than 24 hrs before our scheduled move only to be told they over booked and if it was ok, would I be willing to moved the day back one day. So I agreed since they offered to lower the rate and make me the firts appointment of that day. So Monday came. I was told they would be there between 8:30a and 9:30a. I'm almost 3 months pregnant & I feel asleep about 9am. I woke up around 11am. No movers!!! My husband said they called at 10:48a saying they were behind and several workers called out. 8 to be excat.

A few hours passed, still no movers. We called them back around 1pm. Was told they were still coming it would be another few hours. At this point we are upset but we wait, and wait and wait. I took another nap this time with my 17 month old who wasn't to thrilled about being in the house all day with boxes everywhere. We wake up around three. Still no movers. My husband calls. It was a little before 4pm. He was told \"the guys are finishing up a job now and they are headed your way\". My husband asked what time can we expect them? He was told \"between 5p and 6p\".

It's heavy rain. 6:20p driver calls. Here is our conversation:\nDriver: We are headed your way\nMe: Sir it's raining, like really raining. Isn't our stuff going to get wet??\nDriver: Yes Mam it is.

I've used 2 different moving companies in the last year, All My Sons and 2 Men & A Truck. In short, I'll likely be using 2 Men going forward because it was just a better experience overall and worth the difference in rate per mover.\n\nPositives: The All My Sons (AMS) hourly rate, per mover, is far less than the competition in the field. Their sales staff is persistent in booking orders (which I like - some don't). They call a lot to check in and see what they can do to help. The movers didn't really sit around; they moved with purpose most of the time. The movers were very nice and did everything they could to provide good service.\n\nNegatives: We were scheduled for 8-8:30am arrival; they didn't show up until 10:30am. Furthermore, I had to be the one to call to find out why they were late (had to call 3 times). The operations gentleman/rep that I talked to about their delayed arrival was straight forward but more in the sense of being border line rude. Just my opinion at that time; and I'll admit I was heated & mad having to call 3 times so the rep could have been nice the whole time but I wasn't truly listening...the underlying issue had something to do with the moving truck needing gas and their gas card limit was too small for what the moving truck needed; getting approval for the gas was what created the delay. Ultimately, the ops office set up the movers for failure.\n\nMoot Points: I don't know that the movers were properly prepared for my move. I don't know if I did a poor job of describing what's going to be moved, or if AMS didn't communicate to the moving team.\n\nBottom Line: I needed a moving company to move items. AMS did that. I wasn't blown away by their service.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1477920573821, "text": "Matt, Thank you for your valuable feedback, we are sorry we did not meet your expectation on your relocation with us.

The first time, the office decided we needed to change or pin bc the code they gave us was to easy to access the unit for others. Which I completely understand, but they didn't even call us, just locked us out. The second time, the new owners had taken over and decided we needed to update or CC agreement (we needed to sign it) so we got locked out again.. the third and final time they locked us out bc the cc was expired. I WENT IN AND SIGNED A NEW CC FORM IN JANUARY, THEY CHARGED US IN FEBRUARY AND THEN LOCKED US OUT ON MARCH. MAKES NO SENSE!!! My husband had taken off the day to have all of our stuff from our shed at home  moved to this storage shed.  And he couldn't bc they had locked us out. And I would also like to add. The March payment was due on the 1st.. so even if they didn't have an updated card on file, which they did, I still had the entire day to pay it. So i called the office this am to see what happened and the lady in the office says \"oh the card was expired.\" I told her I had came in and filled one out in January, and was charged February so there's no way that's possible. She then says I'm not sure why that didn't work. Really. So me being inconvenienced and my husband missing an entire work day is ok. Whatever.
