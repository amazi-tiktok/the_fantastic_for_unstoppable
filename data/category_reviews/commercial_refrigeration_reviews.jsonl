Tech came out and checked voltage, and changed a fuse. They charged us 1.5 hours of labor, for a 20 min fix.\nThe issues above persisted and we called to have them come out for repairs again. The techs arrived and  tested voltage and various things but could not find the issue. It was my husband who discovered a wire that was cut and causing a short. The techs fixed that, and also cleaned the coils thoroughly on the unit.\nWe are still having some issues with our unit not cooling properly which were brought up in the first visit, but since the issue hadn\u2019t happened that much over the course of the past 5 years the tech didn\u2019t think it required any further investigating.\nThey will charge you for the techs coming from Opelika, however my husband talked to the tech and they were already in Columbus, had just finished a service call and were heading to our house. When my husband brought this up for Mr. Farnell, he stated that they had to include for fair wear and tear on their vehicles.\nTried to bill extra hours for labor, good thing I noted the time when they arrived and when they left, plus we had a rain storm that stopped all work for the duration of the storm.\nCharged us for fuses, that we provided since the tech didn\u2019t have any.\nMy husband called the office to challenge the charges on the bill and did negotiate them with Mr. Farnell, who agreed that something were charged/done in error.\nAs small business owners, we try to utilize other small business owners when possible. We have spent over $10k with this company (for the new unit and repairs) and after this experience will never use them again.

Cut me off mid sentence, wouldn't let me finish talking, and talked over me; insisting that he didn't know anything about this issue and that I needed to remove my review.

A week later, the temperature in the house starts rising so we call them out to look at it again. First, they told us they\u2019d be out in a few hours since no one was home at the time. They call my fianc\u00e9 back a couple minutes later and say they are at the house waiting on us and he proceeds to tell the guy he told someone on the phone no one was there for at least another hour. The service guy got angry with us because of poor communication within the company. Then, the service guy proceeds to tell me it\u2019s because the unit \u201cmight\u201d be low on Freon. He never looked at the system in the basement, just outside so I don\u2019t know how he got an accurate solution.  He charged us for the most expensive Freon (he only used 1 lb) and $99 for less than an hour of service. Needless to say, it was a complete waste of time and money because the problem was ongoing and we had another company come out a few days later. That company was able to tell us the problem right away which the other guy would have, maybe, known had he looked at the system in the basement.

Our AC stopped working and we were advised we need a coil and condensor replaced. The fee for that was $3850. A month later the ac went back to blowing hot air. We called for PB to come back out and the technician stated a part was loose and needed to be replaced from the first service job and we would not be charged. That fixed it for about another month or two. The next technician stated a frog short circuited the system and he removed it and the ac went back to blowing like it should for another couple weeks. Every visit after the alleged frog incident has been one excuse after the other. We're doing renovations and were told the filters needed to be changed more frequently and the house would cool down. We continued to change them weekly and still no luck. We called yet again to advise of the continuing problem only to be charged $79.99 for them to clean the coils and blame the filters. The AC still continued to blow hot air and then the attic began to leak. So ANOTHER call was made. The technician stated the coils were frozen and that the ac needed to be turned off and to change the filter again (at this point we're already changing it weekly and have completed the renovations). The house still didnt cool down and the ac was still leaking. Another call was made the same day (as a leaking attic is urgent and ruining the ceiling) the technician returned and said the coil was shooting out water (ya think!!!! That's why we called in the first place!) had they bothered to look and not blame it on the filter they would have discovered it on the first visit. So the technician fixes the leak and says give it time, the house will cool. Guess what, it's still not cooling!!! So we wait a week (we work and can't keep taking off for someone to come out) and call them back out. The technician now states the roof doesnt have enough vents  and the attic door is off centered and that is what's causing the house not to cool. He said he tweaked something and give it a minute and it will cool. He also states he was advised to charge for coming out. What is there to charge for? The house is still hot, the temperature is steady rising as I type, and the original problem has not been fixed. They're basically grasping  at straws at this point and have run out of probable excuses.  Be prepared to throw away $4000 plus dollars and live in heat if you use this company.
