Just make the drive to Birmingham or Nashville where you can find experienced doctors who actually want to help you. I saw Dr. Cho here twice, he's also the new guy they have to write his name in on the appointment cards. The first time I saw him was to evaluate my neck pain and get a diagnosis, then a treatment plan. On the first day they send you to physical therapy, this is just a given with any surgeon exhausting the possibility of anything working before surgery. Then you will also be set up with a pain doctor in their office, which will take you a week to see the first time then a month or two the next time. I expressed that I had no interest in being on pain medication and taking shots to come to find out was not the answer, nor the prescribed treatment for my condition, the only used option was surgery which he will not do because i'm not the most perfect patient for surgery. The condition i have is forminal spinal stenosis and it is advanced to the point over the years that it, as it almost always does, has exacerbated old injuries to my lower back and put me in a ton of pain. Dr. Cho doesn't care if you have a loss of feeling in you limbs, or you are in sever pain, I mean he doesn't even go over your MRI with you in the office, he puts it in his very formal text book response he creates and sends to your pain doctor. If you do any shots don't expect him to evaluate the area because he won't, nor will he do any physical examination to further understand your condition. The most he will do is set there and tell you what he thinks without discussing anything with you and you are supposed to live with it. I had a second and third opinion after my first initial visit, and both out of respect for their profession asked that i return for the second visit with Dr. Cho before I came back to them, because they were sure that he would do the surgery at least on my neck, so I could heal and work on becoming this perfect patient so he could or they could fix my lower back. The second opinion I had wasn't by my choice, it came when I was hospitalized for loss of my bladder and bowl control at my primary physicians office which is concerning especially when I also was having a hard time walking or standing. The third opinion I had locally just to confirm his and the ER surgeons diagnosis. So when i went back i again expressed my extreme disinterest in being drugged up or shot up every week, because two opinions and multiple medical studies i had read by this time all say the same thing. The only thing that fixes my problem with (in any patient) a near 100% rate of success is surgery. You can imagine my surprise when he went totally in the opposite direction. In short i'm scheduled for my surgery next week in Birmingham after seeing one of the surgeons at the neurosurgery center there, who actually had some reservations as to doing it early but consulted with another physician in the room with me (nice to not be left in the dark) and told me the recovery may take a week or two longer but they can fix the issue. Again, In Short save yourself the time of seeing someone who only cares about the money and how long they can keep you taking shot's, pills, and collecting from you and your insurance company. Not to mention i couldn't be released to my job until i was fully medically cleared, and taking pills and shots doesn't get you cleared for normal duty at your job. I've learned to go with my instincts lately with doctors, some you can tell first off if they are genuinely interested in helping you or are just there to collect as much money as possible. (this was my first instinct with Cho, yet i ignored it) and the rest is history, just hope others heed my advice on this guy.

I was rear ended Sept 18th 2015, Dr Tao, found out where the source of my pain was coming from and fixed it ONE BY ONE. First, I had a C 6-7 herniation, I had cervical surgery on that level Dec 1st 2015, didn't have to go to therapy or wear a neck brace. He used Glue to close my incision, no stitches, gauze or bleeding afterwards. Totally took away all of my neck issues.\n\nI lived in pain with sciatic and back pain in the si joint region for 8 months. He could have done back surgery and it would've failed, because, it wasn't in the upper spine, but in the si joint above my tailbone. He explained this to me, sent me for injections in the si joint, the injections relieved the pain for awhile. By doing this, he knew, this was the area that was damaged.\n\nI had been reading about the Triangular implants designed specifically to stabilize and fuse the heavily loaded SI joint.  which is called I FUSE. We discussed this procedure, and June 21st 2016 I had it done. It's now 7/7/2016 and I have no pain in my back or tailbone area or legs. The day of surgery, I was laying there before my surgery and thought I would cry from the back pain, when I woke up it was gone.\n\nI was on crutches less than 14 days after the surgery, It's fusing, and I am so glad I found Dr Tao and the Neuro Center in Huntsville Alabama. I would trust this group of Doctors, especially Dr Tao with my life. If you've had failed back surgeries, in pain, please go see him today. I'm glad I did. I am totally drug free! Didn't take any pain Killers after my surgery. Some bruising pain will happen for about 3 days, nothing like the pain I had before my surgery.\nDon't be afraid of the I-fuse surgery, at the moment I am walking around on both feet and can't even tell I had surgery June 21st 2015", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1468244078054, "text": "Thank you for trusting us with your care.
