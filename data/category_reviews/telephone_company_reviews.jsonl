I had originally purchased a phone from the Florence location for my daughter and it started having issues on day one.  We took it back to that location 2 times and of course they did their diagnostic tests on it, reset it twice and then sent us on our way.  Apparently i got a \"bad APPLE\" because none of this fixed the problems.  Fed up with this location, I decided to visit the Muscle Shoals location.  Let's just say that this will be my \"go to\" store going forward.  I was greeted by Nicole and she was absolutely amazing.  She presented the issues we were having to her manager \"Trinidad\" I think was his name and he agreed that the phone was bad.  They didn't have that exact color of phone in stock so she asked if I would be willing to drive to the Decatur store to get one.  I said yes so then she proceeded to call that location and told them everything.  She set everything up with a rep at that store and we swapped the phone out.

So, we went to the Centerpoint location and the lady told us we couldnt do it even though I told her we had to just left their other location and they were going to do it. She just gave us a very nonchalant attitude and proceeded like she was done with us and was going to help someone else. She didnt even try contacting the other store. She was just like sorry i cant help you. We left here and went back to Gasden Hwy and they did it for us with no problems or extr charge. I know this is bad to say but I knew that because the location of the store, the rep was going ot give us problems. This is very bad business especially if thats how she treated us being that we were new to this company as a whole.

I went in to upgrade my and I was super excited because it would be my first iPhone . The store associate LaQuita Miles , the other team members were calling her by her nick name Shay was very rude and disrespectful.. she had an attitude the entire time helping me. So she tells me I had to pay $70 downpayment .I let her know that I looked online and it said there wasn't a down payment needed . She got defensive and said well this is what it's saying . She then said if you wanted to jumped then it would be free. I said well you didn't tell me that . She looked right at me and said it's not her job to explain that to me because it was previously explained to me when I initially got the jump service ....I couldn't believe she was talking to me like this and the fact that she said it's not her job to explain anything to was disgusting . I then proceeded to walk out because I didn't like how she was to talking to me and was going to go to another store ...she made a gesture of rolling her neck while my back was turned to leave and my niece saw it ... she exchanged words with my niece and they began to argue ... I asked to speak to the manager  . The manager Will came out and he could get her to stop arguing with my niece another store  associate had to stand in front of her because she was moving toward my niece as if she was going to assault her ...Eventually after being asked several times to got to the back she went . I was there for 4 hours trying to transfer my info over from my galaxy phone to the iPhone . The whole time we were there the employee Shay was in the back on the clock , sitting in the back. Also I was the one who had to google how to do a hard reset on google because the manager Will had something else  that he needed to do and the store associate that he left to help us couldn\u2019t reset the phone and wipe out my info . Not once did Will apologize for the behavior of the employee Shay , he was even going along with her trying to justify her telling me it's not her job to explain things to me . There also was not an apology given for the long time we were in the store . I've been wit he T-Mobile for 9 years and I pay my bill with my hard earned money and the slap in the face I received that day at that store was disgusting ....also the whole time I was there the other girl store associate with pink hair was rolling her eyes at us I guess her and the Shay girl were friends . I still can't believe how we were treated that day ...Also the long wait was due to transferring my messages over to my iPhone which never happened important messages that I needed were lost ... With ppl recording things and putting them on social media this incident with you're store associate could have turned into a viral video . I hope this is looked into so no one else has to have the same horrible experience I had . We came in the store around noon and didn't leave until a little before 4pm", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81e9fbbf21d1:0xc130a49dea94c090"}

After walking into the store we were greeted by an older, larger man. He was initially standoffish and not very welcoming until we mentioned that we were there to buy new phones.\n\nEverything was mostly fine, until I asked about a promotion at for the new Galaxy S10. The promotion was for a new, qualifying line you\u2019d get a large portion off of the phone. Because of the situation of adding a line for my wife from a different carrier, I wanted to see if we could count that for the S10 and then get her iPhone XS discount with her trade in. He insisted there was no way he could do that because I was an existing customer. I was there to release my number from my parents account and start a new plan, add my wife, and get new phones. Yet according to the sales rep, it wouldn\u2019t count and the full phone price would need to be paid because my number was already with T-Mobile. He said I could get a new phone number for myself and that would allow me to do it. I was surprised at this and since switching my phone number would be an extreme inconvenience, I asked him if I left T-Mobile for another carrier, would I qualify for the discount then. He replied that I could leave but I would get the discount until after I had left for 90 days and he \u201ccouldn\u2019t guarantee the deal would still be here\u201d when I come back.\nMy jaw was on the floor with this one. He then left to take a call and brought a younger representative over. The new rep told us about the same thing and was apologetic and started discussing other options, which started bringing us back out of our awful experience.\n\nDuring this back and forth, I received a call from a \u201cT-Mobile Expert\u201d named Michelle and she lived up to the title of Expert. She was just calling to release my number from my parents plan but ended up handling the situation and getting me the deal I was asking about without any issues.\n\nWhile I was talking to her on the phone, the gentleman I spoke to first was telling my wife at the kiosk that there was no way that the rep on the phone could get me the deal I wanted and made her feel very uncomfortable. He then came up behind me to try and get my attention to tell me the same thing and I had to plug my ear to hear the lady on the phone as he was right behind me saying, \u201cHey. It won\u2019t stick after she does it. Hey. You won\u2019t get that phone for that price.\u201d\n\nI eventually I had enough of this, turned around to get my wife, and we walked out of the store to sit in our car in the parking lot while we spoke on the phone. While we were on the phone in our car, the same man came out to the parking lot with a tablet and proceeded to wave at my wife on her side of the car to get her attention, she opened the door and he stated, \u201dI can show you right here that she cannot get you that deal.\u201d I tuned over to him, thanked him for letting us know, and closed the door for her. We left after that and the rep on the phone was able to do everything else for us from there, ending our encounter with the store.\n\nI was absolutely stunned by by this experience as I have never a bad encounter with T-Mobile prior to this. My family has been with T-Mobile for 12 years and switched from AT&T because of the price difference and great customer service by comparison. I can confidently say that if that T-Mobile Expert hadn\u2019t called me she did, I would have changed carriers that day and most likely for good. My advice? Drive a few miles down the road to a different T-Mobile store and you\u2019ll most likely not have the reps chasing you to your car to prove to you that you\u2019re wrong.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a3ee78e535:0x5cebcc8e5c29f674"}

When I arrived Brittany greeted me at the door with a very pleasant personality.  I explained to her and Catherine, also pleasant, my situation and Catherine started the process for the suspension.  Alex was also nearby and provided very good information and advice during my visit.  While Catherine was on hold with the Verizon rep on the phone, she noticed from viewing my account that she could save me money by utilizing the promotion that was ongoing to pay off my daughter's phone and also upgrade my wife's.  Since my wife was at work at that time, I told Catherine and Brittany that I would return with her that evening to take care of everything.  When we returned we were greeted by Christie, one more person with warmth and courteousness, who helped us get started with the process once again.  Our experience was the best one we have had with any Verizon store in town.  We were made to feel right at home, and even when the process hit a snag, through no fault of their own, we were still pleased with the outcome.  Even Scott, who was not involved with assisting us, provided good conversation and hospitality.  In the end, my daughter's services were suspended, my wife upgraded her phone and my bill decreased by approximately $75.  After it was over we were still there 20 minutes later just talking.  We even \"adopted\" Brittany as our second daughter.  Everyone at that store are valuable assets to the Verizon company and brand.\nJOB WELL DONE!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605210078540, "text": "Chris, thanks for that shout out!

Everyone has different needs and habits. Michael V. has been a great help to all of us making sure each person has the right phone for their needs and their habits. We have quite a variety of personalities; dad doesn\u2019t like change, some of us are accident prone, and others use their devices to manage all aspects of their lives. Michael has helped us on several occasions find the right fit for each person not only in devices but even in the accessories for each person. He is very knowledgeable about all the devices and the accessories. Personally, I am amazed at his patience with all the questions many of which I am sure we asked more than once. Thanks to Michael I feel we all get the most out of our devices and make the most of all the bells and whistles for each device. We all are very busy juggling life in general and we struggle to find the time to visit the store once let alone for every issue or family member. Trying schedule with time with each family member is difficult in the best of times, but this year it has been even more difficult with the need to be cautious because of the pandemic. Michael is always willing to work with us to find a way to schedule us in and has on occasion been very understanding about last minute changes. During those visits to the store, he made sure we felt comfortable with the procedures in place for preventing the spread of COVID. From helping us schedule a time to visit  inside with reduce numbers to being willing bring purchases to the car. On two occasions, I have had to call him from out of state to help deal with phone issues.  The first time, I was on the other side of the country when my husband who was at home reluctantly needed to replace his five-year-old phone. Michael handled the situation with his usually wonderful manner coaxing my husband into a new phone and making sure the transition as painless as possible for my husband (and me!!). The most recent of those was when we were all out of state and my daughter\u2019s phone  broke and she was driving in a different vehicle and needed to have a phone. Fortunately, we found an old phone for her to use because we couldn\u2019t wait for insurance replacement. Michael took the time to walk us through the steps and called to follow up and make sure my daughter had everything set up so she could have access to a phone. It gives me great piece of mind to know that each family member has access to the help they need from someone we trust and are able to stay connected even when I or they are out of state. Thanks to Michael I believe we are getting the best value for our money. It seems like every time I talk to him; I save money.

My mom decided to upgrade her plan to unlimited data and they were so informative and helpful. Not only did they find a plan that worked for her family but they saved her money by changing her plan. She was so impressed she recommended their services to my father in law who was wondering if he should also alter his plan. The staff informed him that he didn't need to change his plan because it would be more than what he needs and would actually cost him more. How refreshing to have a sales person tell you the truth and actually choose NOT to sell you something because it's not in your best interest. Needless to say when it came time for me to order a new phone I chose this location and staff. They spent a lot of time explaining to me about each phone and what I needed. They also explained how to transfer everything from my old phone to my new phone and walked me through the entire process. Very knowledgeable, patient, kind, and helpful staff.

Alisha even kept me and my family laughing the whole time we were in the store. I have always dreaded getting a new phone. The process of remembering passwords, downloading apps, and set up of a new phone in general. However this has all been so EASY!!! I cracked my screen cover within the first couple of days and went back to the store to replace it. Molly was great with helping replace my cover. Even though I still think she sold me a wet wipe (I got the liquid glass screen protector). Lol inside joke.

I called the 800 number and the person informed me that with the unlimited plan you can not use you're work discounts. I was very aggverted to hear that. I was misinformed. The guy on the phone could do very little to fix the problem. At that point I was going to turn in my phone because it seemed to me that Verizon doesn't care about it's customers. But a day later Kara from Cellular sales prattville called me and apologized for misleading me. At first I figured it was just the company's way to make me stay. But as we talked and she told me what she can do to fix this and the whole time she kept telling me she was sorry I could hear it in her voice. Her actions and her dedication to me the customer was outstanding. Because of her I am keeping Verizon and I am extremely happy with my phone. Thank you Kara.

The rep gave us customer service phone number and an insurance pamplet and sent us on our way. Turns out the device was covered under a WARRANTY.....customer service is replacing the device free of charge unlike this location that provided poor service quality to a customer who has been with Verizon for over 10 years. We will not be back to this location as calling a phone number was more useful instead of getting suckered into upgrading a device that is less than 6mo old or using insurance for a manufacturer defect. They also were unwilling to assist with applying a discount on the account and again gave me the number for customer service.

My friend went there 2 weeks prior to do the same new phone and all. She got her new phone free, case and screen protector free, walked out costing her around $75. She was treated well didn't  take her very long at all. Her AT&T phone she had stayed active for about a week before it shutdown. But when I am there I'm there for about 2-3 hours. I got a new phone free but was charged for my case and screen protector. The man that was working Matte says on receipt acted like he didn't even want to give me a receipt said printer wasn't working. I said can you at least give me a hand written one and sign it. A lady that was waiting her turn said take a picture of computer screen. I replied that will work as long as I have something to show the money I spent. He finally printed  receipt  but  acted  like  he  didn't  want  to. I ended up and spent right close to $140. I told Matte about my friend and how much she paid 2 weeks earlier. He acted like he didn't even hear a word I had said. I also told him about when I had done a search for Metro Pcs that I had seen offering for 2 phones 32gb and unlimited  service for 1 month for $75 and told him that's what I wanted. Go figure and look at amount I paid. He told me I had to wait about a week and come back in there for my new # and pay an additional $10 to get that done. He also told me my AT&T phone would no longer work. My friends phone did. Why didn't mine work that way? By the time he got my phone and stuff fixed up after being there so long my feet hurting from standing so long and needing to get home to my grandkids. I told him I would have to just come back another day to finish up I had to get home. He told me I would have to pay same amount again for other phone. Why is that I asked for 2 phones 2 new lines for unlimited talk, text and data. It was supposed to be $75 paid one time per month period. I have tried to call store several  times no answer, I have left messages asking for manager to call me left my # , No call back as of yet. Also having problems with service it says I have 2 bars on phone and I see the 4g on phone but can't make calls. My friend  is having that same issue.

If he's still employed there, leave.\n\nOctober 31st - Went into the store to trade in two iPhone SE 2020's(currently being paid for with installments) for 2 iPhone 12's(one pro one not). The rep, Devon, was dipping the entire time he helped us. It took longer because he was describing how he had lost another customer's money by entering wrong info into their system, and was making sure he didn't do the same with us. It was busy, so I decided to wait him out. We were offered two options for upgrading the devices:\n\n1 - Pay of the SE 2020's in full for $720-ish and trade them in for a $440 promotional value applied over 24 months towards the new phones.\n\n2 - Trade in the 2020's towards their own outstanding balance, making the payoff balance ~$360, then starting the iPhone 12's fresh.\nI opted for door # 2 as it would be only $160 more over the 2 years, but would be $360 less today.\n\nNov 1st - Devon disagreed I guess and called me letting me know that it wasn't his fault, but I would have to go pay another $360 to his store, BUT IT'S OKAY I'M GETTING THE PROMOTION I DIDN'T ASK FOR. He really stressed, many times, that it wasn't his fault.\n\nI let him know that it wasn't going to fly, and he said he was going to call his boss and call me back in five minutes.\n\nEight hours later, I get a text from Devon: Verbatim \"Hey man I just got a response from my higher up. You can't put it on your bill you will have to go back to the store and pay it\"\n\nI asked for said higher up to give me a call. I guess his definition of \"higher up\" is his customer service trainer. Said trainer started the call with a \"here we go\" long sigh and then told me that they know he's a problem, it was his fault, and I still have to pay $360. I ask what time they open the next day and he tells me they open at 9. They open at 10. I then ask if there is someone competent that will be there. He says someone competent will be there at 10:30. Seems kind of insulting to whoever was there before 10:30.\n\nNov 2nd - The competent employee was indeed competent though. It took 30 minutes of sitting in front of the counter at the store while the competent employee talked to exactly one person and had it fixed. It was painless enough to bring a star back to what is honestly a 0 star experience.\n\nDevon called me a few minutes after I left the store to let me know that he had fixed the problem. I let him know that, no he didn't, competent employee did. He then began stressing that he was calling to let me know so I wouldn't have to go up to the store. As if his good intentions would make up for the error, the lack of effort to fix it, the attempt to put me in contact with people who wouldn't get him in trouble, and finally lying to me trying to take undue credit for fixing a problem that he created.\n\nThey then offered me a discount on a phone case or accessory for my troubles. They were out of what I wanted.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604673288803, "text": "Reviews like yours allow us to improve our customer experience.

It is the same thing as going to a kiosk in a mall to get a phone or change a phone plan.  You won't see this tidbit of information anywhere unless you really look or ask specifically.\n\nThe employees work on commissions and therefore don't have your best interest in mind.  They will peddle the phones and plans with the best kickbacks (go in and ask about an iPhone and see what they say about it; most assuredly they will try to discourage those phones as the commissions are much lower than Samsung/LG etc.)\n\nThe employees also do not put out the correct information.  They twist the truth to try to sell and change your plans.  They updated my account to the Verizon Unlimited data plan from the 16GB plan and when we specifically asked if there would be a speed or service difference, we were told no; it's identical.  OOPS!!  After numerous dropouts and super slow data service, when when on 4G, we called Verizon and was told that the plan we're on is the first to be 'booted' off a tower or throttled due to bandwidth issues.  Fortunately Verizon (the real Verizon) was able to fix our account and put us back to the plan we had where we will get good service again.\n\nLesson learned here.  We will NEVER again go to a non-Verizon store (except Costco, their reps are pretty good) and certainly will not set foot in this store again.

She asked for his name so she can report him and he refused to give it to her.  So needless to say she left in tears because she was angry because he was lying ad being rude.\n\nSo we are going to call head quarters and report him.

He then reviewed each phone that we were interested in and matched our needs with the right phone.  He never once attempted to \"over-sell\" us which has never been our experience in the past when purchasing phone equipment.  He then reviewed upgrade discount offers and walked through the data transfer process from old phone to new.  We were in and out in about 45 minutes which is an all time record.  Randall was the most professional, personable, and honest phone services representative we have ever worked with and it made a huge difference in my perception of how this was going to be.

As I use my hotspot for work every day, that wouldn't work. So my only remaining option was to upgrade to a better unit and pay over $150 for that, which I had to do. The new unit seems to work better, but I didn't appreciate being forced to pay more to replace a recalled product or wait for some undetermined amount of time without use of my hotspot.

When I had a issue the lady said, \"just wait tomorrow I dont know what to tell you.\" I decided to just return the product. Once this plan goes out I'm closing account for sure.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886269444f056941:0x3b6afc64353974fb"}

I went in to get an upgrade, Jennifer the sales rep tells me that because of a labor day promotion if i buy a phone its going to come with a case and a screen protector. So Im like cool, I wasn't really trying to get a case or a screen protector but if its included might as well right. She hooks my phone up and the price comes out to like 203.00 which honestly isn't a big deal but im confused as to how a 129.00 phone has 70 dollars worth of taxes, activation fees, and what not considering its not a new line. So Im like ill just go somewhere else cause honestly I could probably get a way better phone with a way better company else where. So she gets my price down to 164.14 which sounds more realistic. Checks me out and hands me the phone. No case no screen protector. So im like wheres the case and screen protector. She then begins to tell me the truth. That in fact the extra 35.00 is for the case and screen protector which wouldnt have ever been an issue had she just told me the cost up front instead of misleading me to believe it would be included with the price of the phone. These scandalous sales tactics are junk. Worse than buying a used car from a lot when the salesman knows the car is a lemon. Just be up front and honest. Dont try and hustle your customers. The entire time im standing there believing theres 70 dollars worth of activation fees and taxes and she never once told me she was charging me for the case and screen protector. Then the manager Allyson comes in to play and says well they are buy one get one free. So your telling me a screen protector cost 35.00? Or a phone case cost 35.00? It kinda sounds petty but my frustration comes from the fact that this sales rep is a liar and a fraud. So be sure to ask questions if you go there of the price doesn't sound legit because chances are Jennifer has mislead you to purchase something you probably didn't want.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0fcc71c1d3a3:0x5aaea6355822e927"}
