They give me a part but off the wrong year car. One difference... there was a sway bar tab on the year car I own that was missing. I had someone else go pick it up for me and did not get to see it until the part was at my home. They knew this was the case keep in mind... I go back the next day to try and replace it and they didn\u2019t have it. They then would not refund me. The part was picked and sold to my mother after being very specific about what I needed and they just made a mistake. No biggie but it is ridiculous to not make good on it... they tried to convince me that I should just put it on and not attach the sway bar and after that the thought I would let him weld a tab on there. No way. I don\u2019t trust his judgement and measurements to the precision that they might need to be at. Especially seeing as how he was pissed with me. 0 stars", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c93811cdfff5:0x2981715d0cce991e"}
