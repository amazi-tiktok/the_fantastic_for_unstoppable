The owner is a very kind man who you can tell has been in the business for a very long time. When purchasing something that can cost as much as furniture does now, it is important to purchase from someone who will honor their word. Not only did they offer several ways for us to finance, but delivery quick being recently relocated to this remote area in Alabama and no family to help move furniture was extremely nice. The owner gave us real honest advice not based off purely an income percentage of what he would receive on each piece. Because we were buying a complete living room and bedroom package including a mattress it was a big purchase and he was willing to help with the more that we purchased. I recently have had several back surgeries and the mattress was the most important piece. He personally spent quite a while with us walking through explaining the purpose of each detail on each mattress and again we were first time home buyers so we didn't really know what we were doing with buying a mattress; never had anything besides hand-me-downs. All in all an incredible experience and would recommend anyone who desires longevity with their purchase of something this magnitude to not buy second hand stuff and purchase from Harvey's where they keep their promises!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578090754019, "text": "Thank you very much for the great review.Sorry so long with reply,systemjust sent to me.Thanks.

I completely paid it at the beginning of April 2021. From the time I fully purchased it in April to the end of May. No one had informed me of the status. I would call the store once every other week. When I called the facility they told me that the furniture was not showing delivery date. I showed concern that I have not received any possible delievery date and asked to speak to the store manager about finding another item with tbe same value that is available. Finally the store manager, (after I was concerned) said that it should be here the first week of June. I decided to not find a replacement since the manager seemed to be sure the furniture will be there. I called after the first week of June since I received no contacted in regards to delivery or any issues. Manager than proceeded to say it is now pushed to the first week of July. I received a call last week and the week prior telling me that my furniture was scheduled for first week of July. After first week of July passed, I called them Monday, July 12th, to be informed that it was again pushed to the week of July 26th. I asked the sales associate if I could get a full refund because their poor communication. And customer service makes me uneasy and I do not trust them that they will delivery my item. The manager was not there and the person said he will contact me on Wednesday when he returns. They told me that refund would not be possible because of the 72 hour no cancellation. I proceeded to call cooperate to file a complaint on their store and because it is privately owned they could not help me. They filed a complaint and said they will get in contact with me within 24-48 hours. After I received no response from cooperate and the store, I called cooperate again. During the process of calling cooperate on Friday, July 16th (less than four days since the last conversation with the store) I found out that the corner of my section is in the warehouse but that other pieces will be in august 26th. Again another time pushed and no response. Each time the dates have been undetermined or pushed further. There is no promise of a secure date. They are persistent on telling me cancellations are not possible due to the 72 hours after full purchase but yet this company does not hold themselves accountable to communication and delivery if their items. After long conversation, the sales associate on Friday, July 16th said the manager will issue a request for cancellation to the finance department and I will receive a paper check refund. I called today July 20th to ask about the status. The request was given to the finance department and now waiting for the finance department to contact me about my refund. The sales associate said that it will take up to 14 days. This is ridiculous. I understand that we are in Covid 19 times.

Please refer to Ashley Homestore\u2019s Facebook page to see my review in detail. The sales clerk ordered the wrong item. The delivery team did not honor their delivery time slot and did not have the decency to inform me in a timely manner that they were coming 2 hours early. They left the wrong dresser. I called Emmitt, the store manager, and requested for them to return to pick up the dresser, needless to say the dresser remained in my home for three weeks. I tried to contact the general manager, Nick on two occasions and, Emmitt was of no assistance and he never returned my phone calls either. After finally getting a scheduled pickup a week and a day later, the delivery team was an hour and 15 minutes late with once again no phone call or text. After posting my experience on their Facebook page, Nick called leaving a message with my phone number as the return contact. Also, someone from their management team left an email address that was not accurate. I say all this to say, my concerns have not been resolved and I did not receive the correct dresser that I paid for. Ashley Homestore will NOT admit their mistakes, correct their mistakes, nor treat their customers with respect. I spent right at $6000 and this is how they treat their customers.

Josh and I agreed on a (out the door) price that he stated would included free delivery and would include the best warranty that I could purchase. Once I got to the register to check out I was charged an additional 199.00 that was supposed to have been already applied to our agreed upon total. I didn't notice until after I left and looked over the receipt of this infraction. They told me that the set wasn't in stock and would take 3 weeks to be delivered. I offered several time to pick the set up myself but they insisted that I let them bring it out and set it up for free so I agreed. They told me that the set would come in a different dates and offered me split delivery. I told them I'd prefer if we just wait an get it all delivered at 1 time when it all arrived and they agreed. Fast forward to Thursday April 8th I called and was told that only 2 pieces were in but they were all scheduled to be there the week of the 8th. Friday the 9th I called bk and was told that the set was there. I asked when would it be delivered and was told that I had to come pick it up and that it wouldn't be delivered. Therefore I (rented) a haul and angrily went to to their store to pick it up. Once I got there I was told that it wasn't there and was at the warehouse which contradicted everything that I was told and wasn't where I originally paid for the set. At this point I was furious and Josh wasn't there so I was told. They then called him/Josh and he magically appeared from the back of the store smiling with mischief all over his face. Once he got close enough to see the anger in my eyes he detoured behind me and finally stood behind the counter accompanying the other 2 young ladies. He lied and tried to tell me that I wasn't given or offered free delivery but one of the assistants who also helped me select the set( she in particular was great and very helpful and even apologized) agreed that I was supposed to have free delivery. I then told him about the split delivery in which I knew nothing about until they offered and he dropped his head knowing that I was being honest. At this point I was furious but still needed my set. They then told me that it was at the warehouse and that the warehouse was closed. This is after they told me that it was at their location and I had to come pick it up. So now I'm standing there with a rented uhaul, being double charged for a warranty, furious and still not able to get my furniture. Long story short I still have to go pick it up again today. I would've canceled it all together but your charged a  25% restocking fee and can't return it over 3 days after the original purchase date. Josh continued to try and lie and say he told me this or that and I made him out to be a lie everytime. Josh is a lier so don't let those fb commercials fool you. My set was over 4k and paid upfront. Read over your receips as soon as you get it and make sure everything you agreed upon is stated and accurate. This is my personal experience, hopefully this will detour you from having a disastrous nightmare just as I did. Please shop else where. Hopefully everything goes smooth today once I go to pick it up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618330066688, "text": "Hello Mr. Gipson. Firstly, I would like to apologize for any miscommunications or any tribulations experienced with the Ashley Homestore Outlet. From my understanding of the matter, there were many miscommunications on the team's behalf. I am not sure why there was so much confusion with the Customer Service on this particular order, and this will be addressed to them. We are experiencing delays on orders due to covid, and though this is a common response for almost all things furniture nowadays, it is honestly the truth. Again, I would like to apologize for the lack of communication resulting in you prematurely renting a U-haul. Our Warehouse hours differ from the store hours, and this should have been addressed upfront ahead of time. I truly feel that if things had been communicated better, a lot of these issues would have been easily resolved, and that is our fault. On behalf of the company we hope you will accept our apology, and please feel free to discuss this matter further at cescalations@ahsmal.com, and a manager will respond.  With all this said, we want to thank you for shopping with us and appreciate you being a member of our community.

We were greeted by a salesman named Alex. He seemed to be a nice guy well versed and educated in product knowledge of everything they had to showcase and sell. We instructed him that we were just looking but we'd come back if we were interested in doing business. He and his manager promised exceptional customer service. We came back about a month later ready to purchase. We spent almost $7,000 with this salesman and company and was sold several empty promises. We were told that we'd have all of our furniture at the store ready to be delivered to our brand new home that we were building by the first week of December. That didn't happen. We were promised several different customer service calls concerning our furniture. They never happened. In December we were told for 3 weeks straight that our stuff was coming and it didn't come. Finally we got some of our things only to find out that as our stuff was coming off the truck that the delivery guys forgot the mounts to put our mirror up that goes to our dresser. Also that Alex ordered 2 loveseats instead of a sofa and loveseat. When I called to make him aware of his mistake I was told immediately that it was my fault as if I made up the invoice myself. I spoke with the manager Josh he apologized and put in a new invoice for a new sofa. He said that our recliner which we are still waiting on would be here the same time the sofa would, which would be Jan. 15th. I was told that if anything changed that I would receive a call. Guess what? That didn't happen either. After the delivery guys left I noticed that they messed up my front door casing in 2 different places. I called this Thursday to inform them of the damage and check to make sure everything was still on track and yet again I was given the run around by the employees and manager Josh as to when my stuff would arrive. Finally he said that yet again its been pushed back to the first week in February. He gave me Ashley's customer service email to send proof of damage and I was told I would receive a call or email concerning the damages as you might've guessed THAT! DIDN'T! HAPPEN!  Before ending our call he said he was going to give me a call the next day at 9:30 when he starts his customer service calls and you guessed it IT NEVER HAPPENED! Mind you we placed our entire order at one time in OCTOBER!!! We were told that there was a 6-8 week wait to receive our stuff which we were fine with because our home would be finished being built by then. It's now January and still were being given the run around. I have never experienced such unprofessionalism, deplorable customer service, and lies by a company who's standards are supposed to be way above par. I am livid and hate that I ever gave this company my business. They care nothing about their customers only about the quick buck that they can get. I wouldn't advise anyone to ever do business with this establishment. Your just another sale to them and they give you nothing but empty promises. If I could've given no stars I would have!

My wife has had this vision of sitting under a back yard arbor watching the sunsets over Florida's gulf coast since we retired here.  Building the arbor was easy.  The hard part was in identifying the bench she could share with loved ones in what has now become a nightly ritual.  I researched various teak furniture sites and determined that Chic Teak products would provide an inviting comfortable bench that would match the beauty of the sunsets.  I wanted a classy, well-made, easy-to-maintain product and ordered the Lutyens bench for two.  It arrived quicker than I expected, but a key piece was damaged during shipping.  I called the company's customer service representative and received a complete replacement with three days.  I assembled the product within two hours (strongly suggest you watch the YouTube video in addition to the accompanying diagram) and it has quickly become the talk of our neighborhood.  It's absolutely gorgeous!  Sturdy with Grade A Teak throughout.

So glad I did. Never in my life have I seen such  beautiful, hand-crafted pieces of furniture ART.  I have ordered a few pieces from the Marina Del Rey Collection and each one arrived more beautiful than the pictures. The pictures do not do them justice.  I ordered the chest media center with 4 doors and raised shelf made from recycled teak wood boats. I had also ordered the Semco teak wood sealer at that time. Within minutes of ordering, I received a phone call from Chic Teak. They asked if I had any other teak furniture. I did not. They informed me that this piece does not require the sealer and that they would be crediting my account. That was the first example of their exemplary customer service that I rate a TEN out of five.  They could have made that extra money but their honestly and commitment to customer service wouldn\u2019t allow that. When the piece arrived (FREE freight) we could not believe how absolutely beautiful it was!!! Such high quality, beautiful craftsmanship, it\u2019s functional ART WORK!!! So, of course I had to order another couple pieces. They are so beautiful and heavy. The colors are so deep and beautiful I find myself just sitting in a room looking at the pieces and all the beautiful colors. Everyone who has seen them fall in love!!!

I run a bed and breakfast and since 1996 on my open back deck I had tried any and all kinds of outdoor furniture from commercial plastics to rough iron and everything in between. It is an open deck that gets full sun, rain and all the elements that nature can throw at it. Nothing had ever lasted more than 2-3 years. So 10 years ago when I paid them $2357 I thought I was nuts but was willing to give it a try as I had noticed a lot of restaurants using it for their outdoor furniture and it appeared to weather it all!\n\nI am delighted to say that it is still in perfect condition, sturdy and beautiful 10 years later! I get many compliments on it and have sent people your way. When you do the math the Chic Teak is cheaper than anything else out there on the market today. Even these new pvc wicker items would never last 10 years and counting, especially in the rain and sun, but your products take a lickin and keep on tickin!!!!\n\nEven the cushions still look great and other than the black trim fading.

Our shopping experience was great but as soon as we paid them it went down hill from there. We originally went to just get a new mattress set and decided to go ahead and purchase a sectional as well. They said they had to order the mattress and would deliver it all after the weekend which was no problem. Delivery day comes and I\u2019m 100% sure 1 of the delivery drivers was on drugs as he kept making weird noises and just biting air..... They bring everything in and get it set up and I ask where the 3rd piece of my sectional was and get told oh there\u2019s no third piece it\u2019s a typo ect. Well a week later they call to tell me they found my 3rd piece of my sectional which I then had to drive to pickup myself and install myself once home (for the amount we paid for the sectional I wasn\u2019t happy) Then to top it off our mattress didn\u2019t feel right from day one. It was hard as a rock and killing my back worse than it already is. (We were purchasing a new mattress for that reason!) Well I finally get my husband to move The mattress Around and realize IT\u2019S NOT THE RIGHT ONE. We paid A LOT for the mattress and needless to say I expected the right one to be delivered! They did get my correct mattress to me finally after almost a week and offered to give me store credit or refunded me some of my money. I tried to purchase other furniture pieces with the credit but he was pricing the items way higher then the advertised price so I finally just requested a refund which they did with a POST DATED check! So, needless to say I was worried the funds would even be in the bank. I then find out the owner not only knew that my mattress was wrong but told his employees to give me what they had in the back and not order the correct one! They did that the day I bought it bc after getting everything done my sales lady said oh it will have a different cover on it bc they changed it so don\u2019t be alarmed \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (the correct mattress they finally delivered looks exactly the same as the one in the show room. So no they didn\u2019t change it)  So they knew before I walked out of the store the day I purchased that they weren\u2019t going to send my correct furniture that they were going to send me what they had in the back regardless of what it paid for and hope I didn\u2019t notice. Needless to say I will not be back PERIOD. None of my delivery was correct at all because they didn\u2019t want to order what I needed but had no problem taking over 5k from me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0b825faf4521:0x49c2aedc8f019c0b"}

They had a good experience with the owner/manager Josh Johnson so we decided to check the store out. Our visit went great, we ordered a Stearns and Foster mattress, a couch, and a chair. $1500 including delivery. Josh told us he would be going out to Atlanta the following Thursday, February 2nd, to pick up our couch and chair and have it delivered Friday or Saturday. He'd call to set up the final details. The mattress, however, he could get to us by Monday the 30th. We set up a delivery time for 3:00. Josh stated he would call me the morning of the 30th as a reminder. Up to this point, everything was great. Until Monday the 30th rolls around, it's 3:00 and there's no reminder phone call or delivery person. I call Josh and he asks if the delivery could be changed to 5:00. OK. Fine. No problem. Five o'clock rolls around. Nothing. Six o'clock. Seven o'clock. Finally, after being stood up repeatedly, my husband (the second of the two men delivery...That we paid for) helped Josh load the California-king mattress into the house. My husband is a disabled veteran and large part off his disability is his back. It is now the 9th of February and we have not received a single phone call from Josh about our couch and chair. I've called him nine times. Once while standing in front of him yesterday. He informs me that their number has changed as of that morning. Mine hadn't. He never called me. Though it expressly states, via their own contract, that if there are any shipping or delivery set backs they will contact me immediately to let me know. So, on Monday, February 6th my husband goes to the store to inquire as to what is going on. Josh tells my husband that they're having some delivery issues but we'll definitely have our furniture by Friday. He'd be giving us a call to set up a time. However, by Wednesday afternoon still no call. So, I went to the store Wednesday afternoon and Mr. Johnson tells me that we 'should' have our furniture by Tuesday. When I asked him why he hadn't kept me informed he said he was busy keeping up with his other customers and if he neglected to call he was sorry. I asked him why he hadn't returned my calls when the number has only recently changed. Surely he got them. No. He says he never got a single one of the many phone calls I made. Then I ask him if he has my number. He says he wrote it down wrong. That's funny, because he knew it when he was talking to my husband, and it's clearly written in our contract/receipt. Oh. And he tells me they're getting out of the furniture business. Be WARY, folks. Be VERY wary. All I'm asking for is common courtesy. Keep me in the loop. I'm not unreasonable. At this point, however, if I do not receive my furniture by this Tuesday I will proceed to take civil action through litigation if I am not given a full refund of the cost of the delivery fees, couch, and chair that I have paid.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88f333433646516b:0x4d6a49b20bf770f4"}

We had seen print ads for Summer Classics but had never really known much about the product.  Fortunately Cynthia was working the day we visited the showroom.  She was very knowledgeable about the different collections, and quickly gained our trust.  She has a very positive attitude and it is apparent she loves what she does and is very invested in her customer relationships.  We spent almost two hours with her and never expended her patience.  After listening to us and showing us many collections, we decided on the Newport Collection.   While expensive, Cynthia showed us the quality of design and construction of the Summer Classics products;  and we proceeded to order a sofa, two chairs, two ottomans, two side tables, a coffee table, and multiple pillows and bolsters.   Several weeks later we called Cynthia for another Summer Classic solution.  We needed two window bench cushions and she solved the problem immediately, ordering two custom dimension cushions with a Sunbrella fabric unique to Summer Classics!   Cynthia is a \u201crock star\u201d and I have recommended her to friends.   She is a great asset to Summer Classics and we look forward to working with her in the future for further outdoor furniture needs.  I highly recommend her!

After leaving, I was complaining to myself, as I crossed the street to my car. A lady, carrying Bath & Body bag, crossed as well. I commented about the associates at the store being lazy.\nAs that person went on. I loaded my things & was leaving the cart on the grass.  The lady in the parking area yelled & demanded I return the cart. I didn't fully understand. So, I asked again what she said. She made her demand on me about 3 times.\nI asked her if she worked there? She said yes.  I asked if she was a Manager? She said Yes!\nI tried to tell her about the laziness I was dealing with.\nShe became irritated with me. No peaceful problem solving was enacted.\nShe came hurriedly at me. I asked her to stop. I warned her, she was crossing the line.  She came anyways, within inches of me, calling me lazy, grabbed my cart without my permission, & proceeded to the store, being loud, calling me lazy repeatedly, & told me to never step foot in her store again!\nShe definitely broke the Covid rules, & came to close to me besides, causes me to feel uncomfortable.\nI requested the 911 service & filed a report.\nThe Manager, should have been more professional.  She ordered me to never come back & she don't have to worry.  I don't want to!!!\nAll I can say is remember when shopping at the Jones Valley location, to take help for you, because they are not much help.  And watch out for the Quick Tempered Manager.\nIt's 4 AM & my Spine & hip still hurt.

First they never called me to confirm my delivery date of my product. I found it online which was a Monday. Well they showed up Sunday unannounced. Lucky i was there but unfortunately there was a dent. I called that day to Lowes Online Customer Support which stated someone will call me from the store that it was fulfilled to fix the problem. I called the store this time and they wanted me to uninstall everything and just give me a whole new one which i stated that I couldn't do that because i paid someone to connect everything which would mean that i would have to pay them again. She stated that they couldn't help me with that. I finally convinced them to just order the storage shelve that was dented and it would maybe take 2 months. At this point Im like whatever. They get me to Chris the appliance guy and he states that they have a whole unit in stock and they would deliver that shelve to me the next day. I was happy and ready to put this behind me. If only it was that easy. Chris stated that someone would call me the next morning to inform me of the time frame that day for delivery. They never called or showed up. That was Monday. I have been calling multiply time today to try and get this resolved but no one is answering their phone in the delivery department.

When they were forced to call me back, I felt like my problems had been resolved, and my appliance would be delivered. The next day, I received an email that my fridge was ready to be picked up. After calling the store AGAIN, it was finally sorted out. I think I got lucky and spoke to someone who cared that it had been nearly two months of waiting.

He had no info - not even on the process and we explained we had a bad experience before.

We went in to return a work desk that he had purchased yesterday, only to come home and find out that pieces are broken and missing. When we arrived at the return desk we were greeted angrily by a lady named Shelia (her tag said CSA Front Desk). She was in the process of helping another gentleman with a wheelbarrow at the time we arrived so I shrugged her attitude off as frustration to begin with. By the time she got to us she took the receipt from my husband, asked angrily what was wrong to which he informed her that the desk portion (the main part of the item) was broken down the middle and pieces were missing. She rolled her eyes, mumbled a few things, then started to walk away and as she was walking into another room yelled back at us \"you know it's a clearance item right?!\"  She then came back out of that room, struggled to get the lid off the box and then continued to tell us in a displeasing tone that our kobalt work desk was on clearance. I then stated \"so does clearance mean that pieces are broken? If so, lowes should not be selling clearance items\". She then argued with me that clearance items are usually returns with missing pieces and I restated that the main portion of the item is completely broken in half. I don't care if it's clearance or not, it was not marked down nearly enough to compensate for a complete useless, damaged piece. She then slammed a refund receipt down and asked my husband to sign. She never asked if we wanted to swap it with a usable piece. She never asked anything, actually. During this entire transaction she was rude and everything anyone in customer service should not be. She was also complaining and cussing under her breath about no one answering the phone around there during our entire few minutes with her. When we were leaving there were 2 more men waiting patiently behind us and just staring in disbelief at what they witnessed and would unfortunately encounter. I told one man good luck as we walked off and he said it looked like he needed it.
