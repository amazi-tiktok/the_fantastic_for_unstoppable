Yet we paid full price & they assured us it was going to be here in two months almost 3 months l8r. No other piece & still more excuses. Just go to a REAL furniture place.

For example,   there are shipping delays from overseas of products that are needed here for the assembly of furniture and chips for new cars.  Because of those delays dates change every day. When we do let our customers know a date, it can change the same afternoon which frustrates the customer even more.\n\nBefore the Pandemic, we could deliver on 90% of our goods within a 2-4 week time period. Now we cannot promise any date...the only thing we ask is that you hold on to your old furniture until your new furniture  arrives. We have even loaned out new furniture while a customer waits.\nWe have wholesale prices right now to help with that unfortunate waiting period. Some items come in next week after delivery, but some do not. It varies with every piece.\n\nWe value our customers, and if we could change what is going on in America we would . We go above and beyond for all of our customers. I just ask that you try and understand the circumstances that all retail establishments are having to deal with and navigate through. They are difficult, and we are all trying our best to get your items here as quickly as we can.\nFactories in America are also understaffed, and those who are working are doing their very best as well. Transportation is trying to find more drivers, so that items can also be delivered in a timely fashion.\nWe have kept our prices  lower than anyone  to help better ease that frustration of timely delivery dates. So it is a great time to purchase from us, but patience will be needed in case dates change on an item.\nThank you so much for your understanding, and if you did purchase from us under a different name - I am sorry for the delays, and I too wished we had control over dates fluctuating."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e9ae266e8c0cf:0x9e6dbbd1150862fd"}

Then he approaches me and tells me if I'm not here to buy anything from him to leave right now and never come back. He turns back around to my husband who was holding our 1 year old in his arms and leans in like he is about to grab him and yells to my husband to walk faster and to get out.

However...the Jones Valley stop CSR's had been polite & answered questions...but wouldn't help gather my large quantity of items. I had to gather, lift, & carry them.\nFollowing Spine & Hip injections, this was strain to my back & painful. Afterwards, I struggled walking. The associate permitted me to use their plastic cart. After leaving, I was complaining to myself, as I crossed the street to my car. A lady, carrying Bath & Body bag, crossed as well. I commented about the associates at the store being lazy.\nAs that person went on. I loaded my things & was leaving the cart on the grass.  The lady in the parking area yelled & demanded I return the cart. I didn't fully understand. So, I asked again what she said. She made her demand on me about 3 times.\nI asked her if she worked there? She said yes.  I asked if she was a Manager? She said Yes!\nI tried to tell her about the laziness I was dealing with.\nShe became irritated with me. No peaceful problem solving was enacted.\nShe came hurriedly at me. I asked her to stop. I warned her, she was crossing the line.  She came anyways, within inches of me, calling me lazy, grabbed my cart without my permission, & proceeded to the store, being loud, calling me lazy repeatedly, & told me to never step foot in her store again!\nShe definitely broke the Covid rules, & came to close to me besides, causes me to feel uncomfortable.\nI requested the 911 service & filed a report.\nThe Manager, should have been more professional.  She ordered me to never come back & she don't have to worry.  I don't want to!!!\nAll I can say is remember when shopping at the Jones Valley location, to take help for you, because they are not much help.  And watch out for the Quick Tempered Manager.\nIt's 4 AM & my Spine & hip still hurt.

I'm giving this place 1 star due to a very, very bad recent experience with one of their delivery folks. To be honest, compared to other local furniture stores, this place is refreshingly well-stocked with tasteful furniture and nice consignment pieces. The floor people are nice and helpful and even the owner is a reasonable man, but I very nearly got into a physical altercation with a very maladjusted delivery driver who (I can only guess) disliked the look of me from the second he arrived. Despite a long professional career starting and selling tech companies, I'm from Alabama and have just moved \"home.\" That said, I look like a run of the mill \"redneck\" and dress that way as well (by desire). When he drove up, he was immediately put into a foul mood by the sight of me. He asked me where to put the items he was pulling from the truck and I pointed and told him \"in the living room right here\" behind my front home wall. He proceeded to leave ALL the items on my porch and drove away. It was a king-size bed, long sofa, two chairs and a very tall cabinet of drawers. I called the store to tell them what happened, they returned the delivery men and he called me a liar, saying I told him to drop them on the porch. He then proceeded to tell me I was a bad person and that he \"knows people like me\" while gesturing angrily. I called the store back while he got the store owner on the phone. I spoke to the owner on the phone while he ranted angrily. Needless to say my blood began boiling as well as I explained what was happening outside my door during the call with the owner. The owner initially bristled, taking the side of the delivery guys but did listen to my account and my offer to show him the video of the event from my front porch Nest camera. In the end, he agreed to refund the delivery charge and seems like a decent man, but he's definitely got a liability on his hands there in the delivery man.
