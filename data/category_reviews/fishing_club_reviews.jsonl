It\u2019s a lot of wear and tear.\nPrior every departure, there is 15min orientation on video which clearly explain the operation around sandbars,\nthe GPS shallow water alarm and there is a special section informing you if you run into the sand there is a $75 charge. No hidden fees, everything is loud and clear upfront.\nI would like to believe, We have it almost foolproof, There is GPS which color-marks shallower waters less than  6 feet in blue color, Deep water is white color. You go less than 3 feet \u2013alarm sounds.\nWhile cruising sandbars are bright yellow visible from a distance by untrained eye.\n\nWe specifically ask in the video to not beach the boat due to our shallow access. We ask to keep the boat floating in at least 2 feet of water with motor trimmed up.\nI am sorry my helper Stahl was not able properly explain the damage of the Propeller\u2019s  hub.\n(Rubber and composite bushing between the transmission drive shaft and Prop it\u2019s self)\nThis is a sacrificial part to protect $ 2,600 lower unit.  Can\u2019t be seen by eye, it\u2019s inside the prop.\nCost of this Power-tech hub is $ 69.00 plus $ 6.00 shipping, labor 45 min on my end \u2013 No charge.\nIf prop shop does it, cost is $ 280.00 .  Damage does not stop here, as the propeller work in the sand the blades loosing the cup. (ability to scoop water and go forward, start just slicing water, Rpm running high and boat does not go fast anymore). Replacement cost $ 630.00\nI am losing more than you  with your damage.\n\nYou present yourself as a motor educated person and trying to help out other people.\nWe thank you. We are honest and we go beyond, our boats are nicest on the island.\n\nCaptain Igor"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a07b1ee0a0e57:0xd9fd06f174faed2"}

The boat was super nice, had a full restroom, nice stereo system, comfy cushions, it was by far the nicest rental we have ever rented. We went to Pirates Cove and had a bushwacker and a cheeseburger, drove around saw tons of dolphins, then went over to the island and collected seashells and played in the water. It was a pefect day, we will defiently be renting from them again, Highly recommend Orange Beach Boat Rentals!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07b1ee0a0e57:0xd9fd06f174faed2"}
