Arrived at the showroom about 5 minutes early, walked inside with my daughter for my appointment and waited approximately 15 minutes, when a gentleman walked out and asked if we had been helped yet. After telling him we had not, he took us into the warehouse where the slabs were and also where Betty (the sales person supposed to be taking over my appointment) was chatting with a couple of other employees. We could hear them just on the other side of the door when we were waiting for her to come out and greet me for my appointment. They knew we were in the showroom, yet they continued chatting. Betty finally came over where the young man walked us to, showing us the slabs. After being in the store about 20 minutes at this point, they decide to do a temperature scan on us. It was hot in the warehouse and we had masks on. We both scanned 99 temps. They acted as if we had the plague. Betty behaved one the most rude way I\u2019ve ever witnessed, in any environment but especially a sales environment where a customer is hoping to do business with the company they\u2019re patronizing! Betty treated my daughter and I, first of all as if we had the plague and stayed probably 10 feet from us. Even once, when I turned to speak to her, she stepped back about 3 steps like I was about to attack her. Then she treated us as if she was doing us a favor by walking through he warehouse with us. She was not helpful AT ALL, and allowed two other people to take her away from assisting us! I held out as long as I could. It takes a lot to make me mad and I\u2019m always kind to everyone, but she was so disrespectful and rude! I would NEVER hire her to work in my company and I hope the owner/manager reads this review and thinks twice about maintaining her as an employee! Betty has no idea how much I had planned to spend on my countertops, tile work, sinks and faucets! But she will NEVER know now!! Because I\u2019ll find someone who DOES want my business and who respects myself and my daughter. You see, I own a successful business. But Betty has no idea of that. She treated me as if I were a homeless person who walked in off of the street with no money and no plans to purchase anything. Little did she know, I\u2019ll be doing all of my business with OHM!!

We understand your frustration with the initial installation of your flooring which resulted in our decision to terminate the original contractor. Obviously we were frustrated as well and we spoke with you at length over the phone about this. The errors he made have been corrected.  You called again with concern that the carpet was not fastened correctly in one area and, though after inspecting we determined there wasn't a problem, we still agreed to have a contractor come and re-stretch it in an effort to resolve your concern.  We disagree that \"they destroyed all the door frames\".  Yes, there was some slight damage done to some of the door frames but they were far from being \"destroyed\".  Your salesman offered to repaint those areas himself but you declined.  We have gone as far as discounting your invoice three times in an effort to appease you.  We have a two year labor warranty and we stand behind it.  The quality of work performed by subsequent contractors to correct the errors of the first was excellent.  Hill's Carpet & Floor Coverings has been in business at our main location since 1986.  The original owner sold the business to his nephew some 9 years ago and the original owner remains active in the business.

He advised me that he would email me the proposal and to call him when we were ready.\n\nI waited for the email but never received it. However, I still called a week later and let him know we were ready to schedule but that I still haven't received the proposal email. I didn't feel comfortable calling to pay my deposit over the phone without a proposal. He wasn't at the office when I called but was going to call once he got settled. When he finally called, I wasn't available but I still didn't get a proposal email.\n\nSo I waited before calling back. Then Clark called and left a msg asking if my consultation went well and if I was ready to schedule. At that time I was not because I wanted the proposal on paper with the amount I was quoted. Never heard back.\n\nSo I called again Monday, 10/12 and spoke with a gentleman about scheduling (yes I was still willing to use this company because the price I was quoted was the best). He got my name and address and tried to look up an invoice or proposal and guess what, there was none!! He asked who did my consultation and I told him Cullen. He said he would get him to call me. Days later, I'm still waiting on my call.\n\nThe other 2 companies I've contacted this week have been very responsive and gotten me proposals within the same day of the consultation.

We unloaded all the floor at the house the next morning the person installing asked why they gave us the wrong stuff. We ended up having to return the floor which we would have purchased the right floor from them but they charged us a 20% restocking fee because they sold us the wrong floor. Knowing what was asked for and needed as my wife showed pictures of the subfloor.\n\nNonetheless they lost our business and stole 20% because they should have fit that bill due to their lack of of professionalism and customer service.\n\nIf you want the cheapest price maybe they are the place to go, who knows.

On that list were the items that they needed for a remodel and there was a quantity of flooring that they needed not a specific floor but just a quantity. We asked her what type of floor she was looking for so we helped her get a waterproof floor that she asked for. She had over 100 options to choose, yes we have a great variety at great low prices. Theirs was a 5mm/20mil wear layer at only $1.49 Sf by the way. She even took a sample of the entire piece. When they came to return the floor the installer came with her and he said that he seen the piece when they brought it to their home, he said that he seen the sample  when he was at the store. Why he did not mention he could not install that type of floor in that house we do not know (this was before the purchase was made). We gave her the floor she chose not a wrong one. She also read and signed a receipt that she still has that specifically says **no refunds** that\u2019s why we let people take samples so they make sure they take the correct floor for their home. As many people here know that this is a family and USMC veteran owned and operated store and we treat people with respect. We have extensive knowledge about flooring and helped her get a floor that was waterproof that they did not want to install. We then proceed calling our supplier which does take returns at a 20% cost. Which they claim we stole but we have to give that to our supplier to return the floor just like any other store that charges restocking fees for special orders. We tried to help them and get their money even though we do not take returns and they accepted the 20% from the supplier. We never sold a wrong floor. The customer saw and took a sample and we gave her that exact floor that all the names and numbers match to the sample to the receipt and to all the boxes they took. We never sold a wrong floor. We\u2019re just following store policies that she was well aware of when she signed and payed for her floor."}, "gmap_id": "0x888925dfcab2f593:0x34e9f2c50edd6c0b"}

While the two employees working the office could not provide a solution to my issue they asked for me to leave my contact information with them, and provided the business card for a coworker that might be able to help. I was told they would have that person give me a call to set up an appointment to have someone come out to my house to see if they can troubleshoot my issue and possibly come up with a solution. After nearly a week there has been no communication from them. Instead, I had to call the person on the business card only to then be told he was not the right person and that he needed to have someone else call me back instead. Still waiting on that call back. My problem is that I bought a set of glass fireplace doors for my fireplace that I should be able to easily install myself, but they do not fit by just a few millimeters in height. I have double checked that I got the correct doors. I know the manufacturer and model number of my fireplace, so I bought the coordinating doors for my fireplace. I am worried that the fireplace and/or tile surround was not done properly and therefore might be the cause of my issue.
