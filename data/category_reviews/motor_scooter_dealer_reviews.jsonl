I walked up to the counter and stood there waiting to be acknowledged so I could ask for assistance, and they just continued to eat and decided I was not worth turning around for.. so after a few moments I decided that this was their customer service at their best and I was just going to have to find it myself.. I finally found the crutches behind me near the entrance (couldn\u2019t see them as I entered the store) as I searched for the right size for my wife, I noticed the size I needed was not marked, but a pair that was in the \u201cadult\u201d slot with no indication of the size.. I finally got there attention by asking \u201ccan you tell me what size these are\u201d.. I guess they REALLY weren\u2019t concerned about me when she responded \u201coh those are $25\u201d. I said \u201cok.. but what size are these?\u201d She walked over and said \u201cwhat size do you need?\u201d I told her 5\u20195 (adult) she looked through them, I guess thinking I was too dumb and hadn\u2019t thought to do the same.. and said \u201cwe have some in the warehouse, but it\u2019s closed, but you can come back on Monday and get them\u201d.  I asked what about these that aren\u2019t marked (clearly looking like the size I needed) oh those are the display, again confirming that she could have the crutches for me on Monday. She was never in her reply\u2019s but I felt like I wasn\u2019t worth their time.

Joe was EXTREMELY gracious, knowledgeable, friendly and laid back - he's just like a longtime friend that you haven't seen in awhile!  We decided on a white Wolf, full face helmet and alarm system.  The purchase process was very smooth and easy.  Joe answered all our questions and concerns and assured us that delivery could be expected in a few days.  Sure enough, 4 days later we returned to pick up the Wolf - it was all prepared and ready to go - just as Joe assured us it would be.  My grandson was so excited!  After break-in, we returned the Wolf to Joe for fluid changes and adjustments and again had a most pleasurable experience; the maintenance took only a few minutes; Joe even provided my grandson with several shaded sun shields.  It is with a great deal of pleasure and considerable pride that I highly recommend KMG Powersports and Joe Berrer and his staff to any and all who are in the market for a powersport.

The additional items and Alabama mandatory tire sales fee were the only charges the customer wasn\u2019t aware of. The customer was phoned to be informed, but didn\u2019t  answer the phone during the servicing, so that we could make him aware of the extra needed items.  When the customer arrived to pick up the unit, and was presented the repair bill, he was adamant that he wasn\u2019t going to pay for the extra items, so it was offered to remove the items and return his original equipment.  In the end the shop owner marked down the cost of the repair and the shop gave the customer a free tube to help ease the cost of the repair.

This was my second brand new $10,000+ Honda.  I recently purchased a $10,000+ KTM elsewhere (Not from Halls) because I could not get this dealer to work with me.\n\nFirst Red Flag, the bike had 14 miles on it at delivery.  I guess someone took it home for the night...  (They did disclose the mileage at the time of sale.)\n\nLater, I had some issues and wanted the bike looked at under warranty.  I was told they would charge me to look at it if they could not submit a warranty claim to Honda.  This is lack of basic customer service.  If you want your customers to come back you take care of them.  Take care of your customer and they will take care of you.\n\nLater still, I wanted to trade in my paid off bike that I purchased from them for a new one.  They told me if I wanted to trade in that they would \"give me a good price\" for my bike because I bought it from them and I'm buying another.  Great!!!, or so I thought...  They offered me about 80% of my motorcycles KBB Trade in Value.  80% of Trade In!!!  My bike is in like new condition, air conditioned garage kept!!\n\nSo long story short, I guess I am done with Mobile Honda.  I guess I wont rule out Halls in general...  Its kind of tough with them being the only game in town.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c55fd1ea6e1:0x29463d3329c58ec4"}

I had been having problems with finding someone to work on my bike.  I have a \u201995 Honda VT1100c Shadow.  No one wanted to work on it because of it\u2019s age & my regular mechanic had closed up shop.  When I spoke to, Ronnie I explained what I wanted him to do.  I asked him how long would it take to complete the job.  He told him that it would be two weeks.  I agreed to that.  He came out to my house in late July to pick up my bike & take it to his shop.\nI waited the two weeks & gave him al call.  He said that he was still working on another bike & he was waiting for parts to come in.  I said, that was fine, I can wait for a few more weeks.  Two more weeks came about & he still hasn\u2019t gotten to it.  So, I just gave up & bought another bike in September.  I finally got a call from him on October 10th & 12:38 pm.  He said that he got it done.  I called him back & asked him how much it was, he said the total was $865.44.   I told him I would have to pick it up in a month. He agreed.  When I got there on November the 23rd to pick it up, he had flattened the rear tire.  He said  he broke the valve stem.  He told me he was going to charge me $75.00 to replace the stem that he broke.  I then asked him if we could start it, he said again, no.  The bike did have to be bottle fed.  So, I took it home.  When I got home I bottle fed it, it wouldn\u2019t start.  I called him & he said that it ran when he had it.  So, I asked him if he could look at it & see if he could figure out what was wrong.  He said that it would be two weeks & he would get $80.00 an hour to fix it.  Keep in mind, I just gave him the previous day, $865.00 in cash.  So, I took the carbs back off.  The only thing he changed was the diaphragms. The main jets, slow jets all were corroded & stopped up. He had the float heights all off.  He even used rubber hose for fuel line.  I called him back to ask for half a refund on it. I called him out on what he did.  When I told him that the jets were filthy & the carb bodies were filthy he stuttered & then told me that I am not getting sh*t back and hung up.  I wouldn\u2019t let this man work on anything.  The review on here before mine had a bad experience & they were there when I picked up my bike.  If I could give it negative starts if I could. These pictures below show what I got for my money. You can see that the bottom of the carbs are green & the jets are old & stopped up.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOikOY_9uySYZgFYs1yCu1pjr8BZtBxgR0_EOs=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhLhKb5HMQDNeqRvZbtmc8KlHnW95v1eurcwvz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfYMTVub6Q4n1Pl1qjaSVW3wzgg-2EQdl5Gce=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOohWrBi_KZuuZs2rloW7fiD3qhVAPjuRE0JFjC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLu6wYyOwVVADFo8rLp4GUUTVDDZj5Ase2sJ2S=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB8ELRalR_eFBXcm4HlSFtTC2gO2l35PHpvTYa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU5e-7LjQrUBNqmroCXFgKbwERuAmEQZdOySBK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgVwuVEVgOaOQnwAqi7YlwXUGSHFWBUeoRahs-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnMu7Z4WXFhh-wL7F6MitbO42L2Uzj1C27niZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2NUFL7xZB2E2_ba96Ko7Bd0NJFJ8rZ-zubAh6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzMI0yG2lwNxnXx4ddN8XuxyydEnCmQ480LnZK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt40-BH5IeCZHmqv2sKSd2wkMdHtAiFDnYzG02=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889bfdd2f410caf:0xf666e3cabfd567f4"}

Big Mistake.  He charged us $3500 plus to fix it.  He was clearly aware that it had set up.  The first time we went to get it, It would not start and the lights wouldn't work.  He ask how long has this gas been in here. My husband said 7 years remember you were supposed to drain the tank for me.  He even wrote it sat up for 7 years on the receipt.  He painted the front  fender with paint that didn't match.  He put a used rear tire on it and called it a new one.  It had dirt and clay mud on it and the bike wouldn't start so where would the mud come from on a new tire? .  We left it with him for obvious reasons.  My husband ask him to replace the bushing in the handle bars since we were leaving it anyway.We paid him in the beginning to change the light covers.  He charged us twice the original one he ordered we found in the saddle bags.    My husband starts home on it today.  The brake light would not go off and the mirror was just spinning. You would think he would have saw that when replacing the bushing in the handlebars. My husband gets to Arab while driving the brand new war bonnet on the fender fell off.  Oil is leaking from a bike that he supposedly changed the oil and fixed the clutch on it.  We paid this man 3700 plus and he didn't take enough pride in his work to even wipe the dust off the bike.  I was using his shop rag to do that while we were waiting to get it running last week.  He literally took it out of my hand.  When I first met him i told my husband he seems like a good Christian person.  Boy was I wrong he might be a Christian.  I have no Idea but good is far from the truth.  We are very upset with the way we were ripped off.\nWe took our bike to another shop because it was obvious that Ronnie did not change the tires, the battery, fix the carburetor or anything we ask him and paid him to do. They could not believe that anyone would say the changed tires when they were literally rotten around the rim because it had set up for 7 years. He really screwed us out of 3700.00 He is a dishonest man. The Battery was 7 years old yet he said it was new.
