I received a shoulder injury this summer and was referred by Grandview ER to Dr. Moul.  I went to her office on a Monday and saw Dr. Sudduth who was so kind but felt that I needed to come back the next day and see Dr. Moul to talk about surgery.  I went back the next day and she looked at my X-rays, came in the examination room, and never examined  me.  She told me to take the sling off and go to physical therapy for three weeks which I did.  The therapists questioned why an MRI was never done and felt my injury was more severe than she thought and so did I.  When I returned 3 weeks later for my follow up she told me to stop therapy and gave me a steroid pack.  I told her how bad it was still hurting.  Still no MRI so I went to my regular doctor who sent me for an MRI.  I have a torn labrum and have an appointment with Dr. Andrews surgical group tomorrow.\n\nI had my surgery with Andrews  on 11/20/20 and had a labrum tear repair,  rotator cuff repair, and debris cleanup in my joint.  I am looking at a long recovery now which could have been avoided and already done with a simple MRI four months ago to see what was really going on inside my shoulder.  I am very frustrated because I spent  probably $700-800 dollars in unnecessary PT fees and copays which only made my issues worse.  Since surgery I have started PT but am fixing to experience a break in services because I have used my allotted physical therapy services for the year by being sent needlessly to therapy for a month by Dr. Moul instead of her taking the time to do an MRI to see what would have been obvious.  I am beyond frustrated with the situation above and will be looking into possible courses of action to recover expenses that could have been avoided if she had used reasonable medical judgement.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605536459814, "text": "We would like the opportunity to address your concerns.

My first visit with him was Nov 6 fracture ring finger sprained middle finger. He had me to start Occupational Therapy immediately. My return visit with Dec 8. My range of motion had improved however the strengthening had not even begun. All of my OT were saying the same thing my hand needed further OT because of my job. On Dec 8 2020 Dr. Bonazt entered the room and began talking with the door of the room wide open. I asked if he could close the door while we discussed my injury. His response no because of COVID-19 a violation of my patients rights mind you Dr. Bonazt was not wearing a mask nor gloves so much for concerns. Also, while waiting on him the door was closed the entire time and anyone else that entered closed the door behind them. He ask me what my job title was twice which I\u2019m sure was on my report. He indicated that the fracture was healing pretty good I didn\u2019t need surgery and therefore there was nothing else he could do. I question him because I must be 100% my strength in my hand indicated that I could hold up to13lbs briefly. I asked him for copies of the report he denied me of that also, stating that workman\u2019s comp would have to request it. Forgetting when I visit him the first time he did.  His sarcastic remarks and tone was very belittling. To add insult to injury as he was walking out he says if you break anything else come see me.

My back kept becoming worse and the pain got to the point I couldnt take it anymore after hurting for about 6 years. Dr. Heck told me that he could help me but i had to have a long and extensive back surgery that was about 5 to 6 hours long. I was ready for anything and I left his office that day confident he would help me.\nDr. Heck came out 3 times during the surgery to speak to my husband to let him know how I was doing, and where he was in the surgery. That meant so much to my husband and me that he had that much consideration not to leave my husband wondering what was going on.\nI came out of surgery that day PAINFREE, after 6 years of constant hurting.  I was Up walking around the hospital floor on the second day feeling like wonder woman, I went home on the 3rd day. I can also walk straight and stand straight. That was a bonus that I didn't know that could be fixed.\nEveryone from the nurse care in recovery, the nurses there on the floor that took the most gentle and sweet care of me. The sweet people that brought your food, the folks that came to your room to get your food order, to the sweet sweet girls that cleaned my room were a joy to be around.

Looked at x-rays for a second then my ankle.  Then he said wow .. looked at x-ray again for an additional 15 seconds and came up with  \"possibly a hair line fracture but it is covered with some calcification\" so not sure - CROCK.  That just doesn't occur in a short time.  He squeezed here and there and ask if it hurt which it did not.  At that point I think he was stumped.\n\nI asked about a cortisone injection for the inflammation and swelling - nope.  OK, how about taking my NSAID's - yep sure.  I told him I have plenty of Day Pro and could try it again ... he got the deer in the headlights look and finally said he didn't know what it was - so, look it up with that fancy smart phone doc.  I told him what it was and he insisted I needed Meloxican instead.  I have high blood pressure and one of the side effects for that medication is a significant increase in BP and it has a black warning.  The other, you guessed it, swelling in the ankles and feet - ho funny is that!  Apparently he never looked over the 4 pages of paperwork they require us to fill out!  OK I say but I need a written script because I'm headed back to Florida.\n\nI go to check out - no script - surprise, lol.  Back to the girl in the stall to ask for it.  She looks at the computer and tells me it was called in to xyz pharmacy ... 15 minutes later we got that fixed.\n\nI was also supposed to be scheduled for a follow up in 30 days ... no one knew anything about that.  Good thing as it would be a cold day before I'd go back to see this guy or this place.  I'd have to be in real tough shape and desperate.\n\nDefinitely NOT RECOMMENDED  I shot better than a half day and $300 for this \"service\".  This outfit is a meat market.

He needs to learn that he can\u2019t see through a person to diagnose their problems. I won\u2019t return here ever again or be put through pain for 7 months for his neglect of a surgeon who only wanted his money. After 7 months he did not know who I was which showed me that he is a money hungry surgeon only. Young surgeon who needs to get his facts straight and stop assuming what\u2019s wrong. A surgeon who didn\u2019t know who I was?  He finally did an X-ray but took 7 months for him to do it. I\u2019ve had enough and never again.

I went to an urgent care and had X-rays and was told to follow up with Orthopedic Dr to go from here. Which would be no different had I went to the ER in Enterprise.\nI touched base on Friday when I woke up and the telephone receptionist was so very rude. It was suggested to give it the weekend and call back on Monday.\nI called Monday 6/19 and was still swelling, hurting and very upset because I knew driving was also going to come into play. I stuck only with ibuprofen instead of pain medication. As soon as I woke up I called around 8:45AM.  Of course, I explained the story again, passed on my insurance information, and updated my personal information. The young lady on the phone was rude and very short. She then told me that she would speak to the Dr and get back with me. I got dressed and was ready to go as soon as she told me. My Mom was here to make sure I had help etc.  I also called the Irgent care place and requested a disc of my X-rays to pick up. My phone rang again around 11:30 and am was asked if I could contact the urgent care place and have the radiology report sent to SB&J. I did and she said that once the Dr had that info she would call me back and try to get me in after talking to the Dr. Again, we sat and waited for hours. At around 3:20 I received a phone call informing me that the Dr wanted me to wait until Wednesday and continue what I was doing. I stressed again the pain, how unstable I was feeling and the problems with being on crutches. She placed me on hold and came back again and rudely said \"call back on Wednesday\".\nSo, I wasted mine and my Mother's Day trying to get appropriate help. It was now 3:40 in the afternoon.\nI woke up this morning 6/21 and called first thing this morning, around 8:30AM only to reach a different and terrible personality on the phone. I explained the entire situation again.  She said that she would talk to the Dr and give me a call back. Of course, my Mother was here once again to help me. At around 11:40AM I received a call and an appointment was schedule for 6/22. I explained the pain, how long I had been put off and again was not her problem and you could tell she didn't care. I said, \"there is no way I can be seen today?\"  Her response, \"The Dr is trying to leave early today and there is nothing else I can do!\"  I explained that I would be calling around to get into a different branch or somewhere else. She didn't care about me and neither did that Dr apparently. I was angry and emotionally upset. I felt like this practice had no reason to be in business.\nI contacted a different office and guess what. It was 11:50AM and I had an appointment at 1:50PM. The Dr I saw was awesome and nobody seemed to be surprised by my story. Also, all the information that I had given to the rude ladies was not passed along. I had to go by and pick up a disc and a copy of the report to take with me. I now have the appropriate diagnosis, I am not in pain, the correct stability, an exercise strategy and feel \ud83d\udcaf% better. I did not want to cancel the appointment that was scheduled with the other office out of anger but I also did not want to be charged for a no show. I called back and a different rude lady answered the phone and I asked to speak to the girl i spoke with earlier. (Yes, I have the Dr's name and two of the girls I spoke with names however, I will keep them off the review. I told her I needed to cancel the appointment and she said, \"fine and hung up\". So if you want to be treated like you are human or that you are actually cared about this Customer Service and Orthopedic office is NOT the place you want to be.\nIn all honesty they are the only ones here in Enterprise and they must think we need them however, truth be told they need us. Without patients there is no practice. I would love nothing more than to see this business disappear and fail.\nHorrible way to treat people especially when I did everything I was asked to do. \ud83d\ude21", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926c24f74906c7:0x3e82ddb2f4245634"}

The staff are wonderful and extremely caring and knowledgeable. The facility is very clean and open, it does not feel as though you are \"packed in\" and overly crowded like most places. I have been to a few other therapy centers over the fast few years, and they are by far the best. I chose this location because I heard about a treatment called, dry needling. I have 2 herniated discs in my cervical spine and I have tried everything to relieve the pain from massage therapy to multiple steroid injections, a nerve ablation and even CBD oil with no relief. I am currently scheduled for my 2nd cervical fusion surgery in a few days, and prior to dry needling and this round of physical therapy, the pain in my neck and shoulder was at an 8 out of ten on the pain scale. I chose dry needling because as anyone with cervical spine issues knows, the knots in your upper back and shoulders are ridiculously painful. Today is my last day of physical therapy, in just 9 sessions of therapy and 4 dry needling sessions with Haley, my pain level went from an 8 to a 2, which is amazing. I would highly recommend Dreyer Physical Therapy to anyone seeking relief from pain.
