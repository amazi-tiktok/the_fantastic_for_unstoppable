They did have red snapper and was able to prepare it for cooking just as Whole Foods does. Their prices are higher than Whole Foods which wasn't a deal breaker. We purchased 2 whole red snapper at $52.61 and a half of filet of Salmon at $27.13. They politely provided ice for the ride as requested. Before we could get home we started smelling a foul smell from the fish. This has never happened on our ride from Whole Foods which is a farther distance. We are not fish experts by any means- just seafood lovers. Anyone who does fish would know that one of the fish that we were sold was spoiled and should not be eaten. Definitely an owner or employee of a seafood market would know this. I did some research to determine the signs of bad fish (Spoiled fish has an unpleasant, sharp smell of trimethylamine (bad fish) and rot. Eyes of fresh fish are bulging and shiny. Eyes of old fish are cloudy and sunken into the head. Gills and fins of fresh fish are moist).\nOne of our fish had all of the signs listed (I posted pictures of the two snappers we were sold).\nSo what was meant for dinner for two is now dinner for one for @ $52.61.\nThis was my first and last experience at the Hoover Seafood Market.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNATU6XldunLINz-JN-nOTTZwB9oIs5fqLJdHcJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921d89afd6587:0xdb4d19b7faf174e6"}

I decided to give it a try and ordered the medium shrimp for 1 which comes with a piece of corn and new potatoes 1/2 lb shrimp for 8.99 + tax.  They offer mild medium or hot so I did medium (should have ordered hot).  Corn and potatoes had a nice flavor, shrimp was really a mix of small and medium so kinda disappointing tbh.  I was asked if I wanted cocktail sauce and butter, I said just cocktail.  Big mistake it cost .50 plus really wasn't enough go figure \ud83e\udd14  wonder what the butter cost?  Very friendly staff and it was tasty.  If you're after steamed seafood in Foley to take out this is a good place.  I suggest already having your cocktail sauce and butter at home.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2FDvEsjnyfXJUZ9Fg1m3wUtRFplV5dvu4GbZU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYvXHud3aWmmyeE3S9lrD2zYBpFH6zMjESzF9Q=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1624582950830, "text": "Thank you for your kind words about our staff and the taste of the food!

The next night we thawed and cooked the Grouper, it did not smell fishy before we cooked it,  but it smelled and tasted terrible after cooking.

I was delighted to find a self-serve hot bar and salad bar in addition to their deli. I believe they even have a seating area upstairs.  All employees were masked which is becoming more unusual since the COVID vaccine has become more available to the general public. Well-lit, amply spaced aisles add to the overall pleasant shopping experience.

I told her I just wanted to check the fish cause I didn't want to get anyone else sick.  Her rudeness is why I'm leaving a negative review.  I understand selling bad fish can happen but her personal attack on my ability to cook was unnessary when I cook fish all the time.  I will NEVER visit this place again!!!!!
