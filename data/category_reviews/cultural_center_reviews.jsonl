We live in Ohio and are back in Sweet Home Alabama visiting family. We searched online for a fireworks display and our search led us to The American Village. We went a little early and enjoyed seeing the campus and tasting the delights of the food trucks:). Our family of 6 thought it awesome that there were seats if you didn\u2019t bring one or a blanket, picnics are allowed, and staff and volunteers were not only friendly but smiling and seemingly loving their roles!  This isn\u2019t your ordinary history museum and the fireworks display was definitely not typical. My husband is a retired Army Captain with 22 years in service. We have visited many places and viewed many fireworks displays including ones on military posts. None have even come close to what we experienced last night!  My favorite parts, the parts that gave me chills and made tears flow, was seeing the colors presented correctly, the heartfelt gratitude of The American Village staff towards Those who serve, and the accurate depiction of our historical relevance. Thank you American Village for making our Independence Day Celebration not only the best yet, but also helping us to reflect on just how wonderful it is to be an American!  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892951889d4a0d:0xd5b51426974ef905"}

If you live nearby or are driving through AL for any reason this is a MUST DO! Pack lunch or eat on the way because they don't serve food here but you can bring picnic lunch, and be sure to check the hours as well because they are not always open on every Saturday, but it is great when they are. Going on Presidents Day was a fantastic experience as well, nothing like getting to eat cupcakes with George Washington!!! The replica architecture is amazing it is really an incredible place to visit! You will want to spend the whole time there if you can and go to as many demonstrations as you can!

Something which they progressively seem opposed to doing.  Their Patrick Henry impersonator is incredible, congenial, and flat out stellar.  The rest of the staff is rude, mean, and hostile.  The noncostumed staff seem to have power trips and take pleasure in insulting people.  Mamy folks have had to complain at their ill treatment.  I've been going to their Fourth of July celebration almost since it began.  But, there seems to be a negative corrolation with the more elegant a locale it becomes, the more hostile they turn on the people.  Ironically, the village celebrates American Independence, but the staff acts like Tories.  I've been to the actual Liberty Bell, to see Mount Vernon, and visited Colonial Williamsburg.  In all of those places my experiences were far pleasanter than at the American Village.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519167167139, "text": "We at American Village regret that you had an unpleasant experience visiting yesterday and we hope that you will call us so we can learn more about the experience.
