You called again with concern that the carpet was not fastened correctly in one area and, though after inspecting we determined there wasn't a problem, we still agreed to have a contractor come and re-stretch it in an effort to resolve your concern.

Your salesman offered to repaint those areas himself but you declined.  We have gone as far as discounting your invoice three times in an effort to appease you.

However, I still called a week later and let him know we were ready to schedule but that I still haven't received the proposal email. I didn't feel comfortable calling to pay my deposit over the phone without a proposal. He wasn't at the office when I called but was going to call once he got settled. When he finally called, I wasn't available but I still didn't get a proposal email.\n\nSo I waited before calling back. Then Clark called and left a msg asking if my consultation went well and if I was ready to schedule. At that time I was not because I wanted the proposal on paper with the amount I was quoted. Never heard back.\n\nSo I called again Monday, 10/12 and spoke with a gentleman about scheduling (yes I was still willing to use this company because the price I was quoted was the best). He got my name and address and tried to look up an invoice or proposal and guess what, there was none!! He asked who did my consultation and I told him Cullen. He said he would get him to call me.

On that list were the items that they needed for a remodel and there was a quantity of flooring that they needed not a specific floor but just a quantity. We asked her what type of floor she was looking for so we helped her get a waterproof floor that she asked for. She had over 100 options to choose, yes we have a great variety at great low prices. Theirs was a 5mm/20mil wear layer at only $1.49 Sf by the way. She even took a sample of the entire piece. When they came to return the floor the installer came with her and he said that he seen the piece when they brought it to their home, he said that he seen the sample  when he was at the store. Why he did not mention he could not install that type of floor in that house we do not know (this was before the purchase was made). We gave her the floor she chose not a wrong one. She also read and signed a receipt that she still has that specifically says **no refunds** that\u2019s why we let people take samples so they make sure they take the correct floor for their home. As many people here know that this is a family and USMC veteran owned and operated store and we treat people with respect. We have extensive knowledge about flooring and helped her get a floor that was waterproof that they did not want to install. We then proceed calling our supplier which does take returns at a 20% cost. Which they claim we stole but we have to give that to our supplier to return the floor just like any other store that charges restocking fees for special orders. We tried to help them and get their money even though we do not take returns and they accepted the 20% from the supplier. We never sold a wrong floor. The customer saw and took a sample and we gave her that exact floor that all the names and numbers match to the sample to the receipt and to all the boxes they took. We never sold a wrong floor. We\u2019re just following store policies that she was well aware of when she signed and payed for her floor."}, "gmap_id": "0x888925dfcab2f593:0x34e9f2c50edd6c0b"}
