Dude didn't hook up the wires of the back up camera to the new system he installed. I was in a rush so left and came back another day. Dude tells me the new system didn't have an back up camera input. Yea Right. I wouldn't have bought the system if that was the case. I take it to an Audio shop that I use all the time to get all my stuff installed including the other after market radio that was replaced by the new one. They call me to the back and show me where the wires where just thrown in the back of the dash versus using just 1 cable tie and where on the back of the system, it clearly has a wire and and input that says CAM. Not to mention they gave me a dash kit that fit the radio so you can't see the gap between the head unit and the dash board. I've gotten a lot of cars tinted here by other workers, but never had the manager himself work on my car and never got electronics installed here and will never again.

GO ANYWHERE ELSE! !\n\nIf you don't feel like reading the entire review I understand so the short version is this.\nMy truck left there worse than it went in and I paid them almost $300 to do that. Lights now don't work, instrument lights don't work, if I turn the AC on after starting the truck it resets the audio system. Wires hanging, trash left in the truck and really, REALLY poor service and lack of respect. When I told the owner about the problems and that I simply wanted a refund for labor only  because I don't feel comfortable letting them back into my wiring he said \"good luck bro! Try and get your money back and I'll sue YOU!\".\nI never want back because after checking the receipt it clearly says no refunds which makes sense when you do work like this.\n\nThe quality of workmanship AND professionalism was and still is the worst I've ever encountered.\nI have NEVER written a review and I'm 30 years old and have dealt a lot in business. The fact that I'm writing this review is an extreme for me.\n\nThe stereo system they \" installed \" for me is very cut and dry.  I supplied the head unit, subwoofer and amp for '02 Tahoe. When I called to make an appointment they said come in first thing Monday (I called on Friday ) and this wasn't a problem for me.\nWhen I called Monday morning to find out why my fiance was waiting in the parking lot for 45 minutes just to see someone they told me they're audio guy doesn't work Mondays but \"they'll make it work\".\nAfter 4 hours of \"installing\" she finally left. When I got home from work and inspected the work I found the following:\n\n1) Wires freely hanging run across my pedals.\n2) The sub and amp were installed on the wrong side of the vehicle after being told 5 times and told to 3 different employees where to put it. I even set it up on the side I wanted it on and they put it opposite.\n3) I was told they tune the system before it leaves the shop. They're \" tuning \" involved them turning everything to the maximum capacity and leaving it. Dangerous to any electronics.\n4) They didn't have the materials needed to do a professional installation on my head unit (which is a $650 Kenwood double din) so I still have spaces beside the unit and looks like ass and nothing like a factory install like they assured me it would.\n6) Left trash wire and clippings all through out my truck. When I mentioned this the OWNER told me \"there was already trash there.\" There wasn't. I keep a clean truck. And when I mentioned the poorly ran wiring he told me it couldn't be because he did the wiring HIMSELF! !\n\nI could list more but you get the idea and as I said I don't write reviews.

I have looked through my Quickbooks quoting system and I don't see a quote for anyone with your name. I went back and checked my voicemails and you left a message asking for a quote on Mar 14, 8:38 AM for tint on a 2015 Honda Accord. We don't tint cars, only homes and commercial buildings, so it's likely I wouldn't have returned your call. The quote you got wasn't from our company. If you could remove this negative listing I would appreciate it.\n\nOur bids while not necessarily the lowest, always reflect the high quality USA made tints we sell, the difficulty of the work, our quality craftsmanship and lifetime warranty which results in a fair value to our customers. We also always set expectations of 5 - 10 business day before an installation can be started since film may need to be ordered, processed, received, precut and then scheduled along with other projects for other customers. Sometimes if we have the film in stock we can get to the customer in 1-2 days depending on the circumstances. I find it odd that we would have all 5 Star ratings with every other customer, but only a 1 Star from you even though you didn't even use us. I also notice you posted a 5 Star review for another tint company who averages only a 2.4 Star review from his other customers. This competitor also only tints cars, while we only focus on commercial and residential buildings. Car tint should never be put on a building and building tint should never be put on a car. This might explain a large price difference, but again, I don't have a quote for you in our system. Our list of satisfied customers includes Alabama Power, BJCC, B'ham Water Works, B'ham Zoo, B'ham Museum of Art, U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, Hugo Black U.S. Federal Court House, UAB, UA, Samford and hundreds more business's and home owners."}, "gmap_id": "0x888918836195af89:0x123c06ae12859b8a"}

I actually met his wife before I met him, although I'm not sure they were married or even acquainted that early on. I was in contract food service and she worked in a similar profession dealing with conventions and such. These are people of high moral character. Mark has done my window tinting, alarms, remote start feature, and some small bit of sound systems. I would like to tell you what you can experience from doing business with Mark, but it's much easier to tell you what you will not experience. With Mark's expertise, in his line of business, you can expect NOT to bring your vehicle back in a second time because of something that was not quite right. He is very conscientious about his work and takes pride in the job that he does although you will likely not see that side of him for his humble personality gets in the way of that. My oldest son is a die hard customer of Mark's but his thing is the sound systems in his vehicle. Whether it's me or my son, when we trade cars/SUV's, the first stop is Audio Creations. I have never considered his prices to be anything other than reasonable except for times when I've asked him if he is actually coming out ahead based on the charge. Never does he overcharge or do any unnecessary work. Here is a long story that I will attempt to give you the readers digest version. Some years ago, I bought a used suburban for my wife when she retired. A '99 suburban had a 40 gal gas tank & here is the significance of that. It had been very well kept up & as soon as we took possession from the individual the first stop was to see Mark. He pulled it in the shop & began work on the window tint, alarm, & remote start. A couple of days later when he finished, & went to start the truck & pull it out of the garage, it wouldn't start! What kind of electrical mistake had he made while installing the alarm & remote start? NONE!! Who would have thought a fuel pump would go out after the truck was pulled into the shop & the ignition cut off? That would not have occurred to anyone. Mark back tracked all the wiring to the point where the truck was before his work began. That took hours & hours, in fact days, but at that point we knew it was mechanical. I had the suburban towed from his shop to my auto mechanic, James Daniel, who by the way is just like Mark when it comes to excellence. He knew right away that on that long suburban with the 40 gal tank, it could be nothing else but a fuel pump. After replacing the fuel pump, it was back in Mark's hands to put the alarm system & remote start back in a second time & he asked for no additional charge. I did however pay him extra but not near enough to compensate for all the time & trouble that he went through. One last thing, I don't do business with anyone that I cannot establish a solid friendship with. Mark is my friend first, & my special, tech, tint, alarm, person second. He knows his stuff & you & your vehicle are in good hands with Mark. No one better.Very recently he even came to my house when I was out of town and my wife called him because my suburban, my Chevy Z truck, and even my Harley would not start. Before I left for my out of town trip I suspected I was having a problem with my alarm on our '04 suburban that he put in '09. It wasn't. In all three cases it was the batteries. He found my battery charger in the garage and got the suburban up and running so my wife was not stranded. His kindness in making a \"House Call\" given the circumstances was more than gracious. My wife had to twist his arm to get him to take even a small gratuity. This is the mark of CHARACTER!! This is MARK PICOGONA & Audio Creations.!!!!

Naturally we had to wait a few weeks as each of our blinds needed to be custom made.

Karla Roberts needs help with her emotions and driving. The driving hazard has been reported to the correct department in Montgomery.  What this woman has said in above paragraph is 99 percent false. It\u2019s sad how our world now just let\u2019s so many just run around feeling \u201centitled \u201c, and can lie, lie, lie,,,and  call lies ,,freedom of speech.  We will all forgive Karla Roberts, forgive her dirty mouth, hope she gets help and someone to drive her around. There are many great,nice honorable women in South Alabama, this woman is just not one of them."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb3e722dfd4c3:0x68e6c38e32b78d9c"}

They are 40 minutes from where we live, but highly recommended by a friend. Great experience, it was quick, under an hour and it looked great. So we schedule my car for the 1st available appt., a couple of months away. No problem. My husband wasn't able to pay deposit over the phone that day - somekind of trouble with payment system. Female told my husband no problem, we were a repeat customer. Morning of 1 pm appointment I call to confirm time only to find my appointment had been cancelled because a deposit wasn't paid and they had already scheduled another for that time slot. She said he (her husband?) tried contacting me the day before but I had just swapped to a new phone -and my voice mail wasn't set up yet. Next available appt.was in May. I just tell her I'll reschedule, or find another place to have it done. She offered to call if there was a cancellation.  My husband calls them and reminds her that she said the deposit issue was okay. She admits she didn't make a note of it and they can get me in. I take my lunch hour and an extra hour (or so) off from work, drive 40 minutes one way, then when I say I'll just wait while it's being done, he says that it will take 3-4 hours for my sedan. I based my timeline on our previous experience (<1 hour) and we were NOT told on any of the three phone calls leading up to the appointment to expect a 3-4 hour window! They even knew I was driving from 40 minutes away. I am not bashing this business, I am just sharing my experience.

When I got back to the shop, the manager was in a frenzy. She pointed out the residue, and kept going on about how they had \"wasted $50 worth of tint\". I remained calm and asked them to finish the job. She said they would have to charge me $10 per window extra as a cleanup fee. I refused, saying it was their mistake and they should have inspected the windows more closely before starting (they are the experts, after all). She became very upset and began to shout, again blaming it on me for not telling her about the residue (which, again, was below the windowsill line and not visible). I stood my ground and insisted that it's not my job to know everything, that's why I brought it to a professional. She blew up, began to curse, shout, and refused to look at me in the eye. She shouted at the tint specialist to reassemble my car and send me away. I knew it would cost me even more at another tint shop to have them clean up the messed up tint that was already on my window from Tint Spectrum, so I reluctantly asked the tint specialist what it would take to get the job done right and get be out. He said it would take another $20, so I agreed to pay it. This time, I sat down in the shop and watched them the entire time. I'm not a tint expert by any means, but in my humble opinion, neither are these guys. One of them (who I later found out was the owner) was eating pizza over the hood of my car and asking me whether it was pink or red (it's obviously red). The tint specialist who was working on my car had to rip the tint from the passenger's window, replace it, install tint on the driver's side, rip it off and replace it, and then replace the tint on the passenger's side AGAIN. I'm not sure what he kept messing up, but if each one of those sheets was $50 worth of tint, he easily wasted over $200 worth. The manager continued to stomp around the shop shouting and cursing. The owner didn't seem to care. The tint specialist left lart \"3M\" logos on my window's right in the middle. The manager asked me if I wanted those removed (who in the world would WANT 3M logos in the middle of their window?).\n\nWhen it was all said and done, my final bill was $140 before tax, which was $20 higher than agreed upon earlier that morning due to absolutely no fault of my own. The manager remained rude and loud the entire time, and I must have waited in the shop for well over an hour after I got back from the library. The manager offered no apology other than something about \"didn't mean to snap earlier\". I don't think there is anything in the world that could make me go back to this place or recommend it. The manager is rude, loud, inappropriate and unfair. The staff are very slow, appear to be outrageously incompetent, and are all dirty on top of that (the tint specialist kept spitting tobacco juice on the ground right behind my car). The owner didn't seem to care about anything. I think the quality of the tint is good, since it's 3M. But the service and the installation quality were absolutely not even worth the one star I am forced to grant them. Do not take your car to this place. You will regret it, especially if you have to deal with the manager.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293004402c64d:0x5a3bd58c8045da98"}

I spoke with Brittney on the phone to get details of the work included and to make the appointment. To sum it up, everything except the engine! I made the appointment and wednesday was there at 8:30am as scheduled. No one was there. At approximately 9 am employees showed up and took my car. Inwas told that the credit card scanner wasn\u2019t working so I would need to bring cash.\n\nAt 430 i called and was advised my car was done. When i got there I spoke with the man cleaning the exterior of my car. I asked if they cleaned the trunk jambs as I noticed a large deposit of mud when i got groceried the other day. He said yes. I then waited about 10 minutes for my car. I watched the man open the trunk and then wipe the trunk jambs...?\n\nIt was an overcast day and the car looked good... until I got home. My chrome exhaust was still black (i rubbed with my finger and it comes off), the fuel tank door was dirty (once again my finger lifted the dirt there), large spots on the chrome grill looked untouched, large spots on the lower door panels were untouched, smears on the windshield,and spots on the rims were untouched. I paid and their CC machine did work... amazing.\n\nI have pictures and videos of all things I mentioned.\n\nI was going to just leave it alone but knowing I paid $200 for a half a$$ job didn\u2019t sit well with me.\n\nI have to say the interior was GREAT! A little excessive with the oils but you can tell they took their time and got everything looking sharp!\n\nOn Friday i called and got Brittney on the phone again. I asked for a manager and she said she would relay a message for me. I told her I\u2019m calling to complain about the detail I got... she asked for details and i told her everything. She called back a few hours later and advised that the owner/manager said i can bring the car back. I advised that i didnt have all day to leave my car to be washed and waxed again. (I highly doubt it was even waxed as there was so many spots that were unwashed... the wax would have stuck to it). I told her honestly the interior looked great and id be ok with paying for that service but need to be reimbursed for the remainder. She basically told me that wasnt an option and that thisnis how the manager handled things. He doesnt talk to customers and just has her. I explained that im offering to pay for the work that was done correctly... most customers would just want a total refund. However, if she cant authorize that and the manager wont even talk to me to settle the issue, ill just have my CC company cancel the payment.\n\nI feel sad for Brittney as im sure she is put in this situation often.\n\nMy advice, stay away.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621257eb4fc911:0x30d2bc60e10a06b4"}

I went to the small location on Hughes, and they did a horrible job on my car. I got the $60.00 \"Supreme\" wash. This is the first time I've paid to have my car cleaned and it will probably be the last.\n\nThere is a large section on my front bumper they missed. There was cleaning product pooled in my cup holders. It looked like they had just sprayed it on in places and never wiped it off. My dash and console was all spotty, and covered in a mix of dust and cleaning spray. They did not open my hatch and vacuum the back. The front was vacuumed but not well. There was a tone of very fine loose dirt  on my from floor mats. It looked like it came from the inside of the shopvac they used to vacuum the car. I can't believe they use a shopvac for this. I have leather seats, and they did not so much as wipe them down. My back seat had dirt in it from where I had sat a pair of boots. It's still there. There are little spots all over the outside of my car. I suspect that is from the spray wax they put on. I'm not sure.\n\nThe worst part is, my car has an odor now. It smells like body odor. I think that may be from the cleaning supplies they use. I don't know. I'm cleaning my car myself this week though. I've got to get the smell out. This place is horrible.

First of all, the package was 124.00!!! So right off the back I'm thinking they MUST be excellent at their job. I was sadly mistaken! I dropped the car off in the morning after making an appointment online. I asked the guy on duty about what time the car would be done. He said \"about 1pm\". I was cool with that. So I left and went to run errands. Around 1:30pm I called the place to find out the status. The woman who answered the phone put me on hold for over 5 min so I hung up and drove to the place to see how things were going. When I got there there was an older woman complaining about a previous job they did to her car. I just remember her saying \"someone owes me 10 bucks to fix this\". Anyway, one worker sees me and says \"would you like to see your car?\" I said yes and followed him into the garage. The car STILL had the dark brown stains on the carpets! Before I can point it out he says \"I couldn't get it out. You should try dying the carpet.\" I was upset because the car also looked like they didn't vacuum well... if at all! Then there were dirt spots on my back window. The door jams were STILL dirty! The tires were dirty and the front bumper!  I ran my finger on both and lifted black dirt from those areas! They uses the wrong cleaning material on my middle console that caused paint to come off. I was very upset and dissatisfied snice I left it there for almost 6 hours already! I asked to speak with the manager. I told him this was no where near a good job for that price. After some deliberation, he agreed to knock off 25.00. This was a bit of a relief, but honestly, that was a 50.00 job (at best). THEN... about 2 hours later, that woman calls me back and says \"your car is ready for pickup\". I told her I already picked it up. She said \"oh I guess I called the wrong person\". I'm so annoyed with this place! They are so unorganized. Save your money and go elsewhere where they do a job that fits the amount that they are charging you. This was a waste of time.

Alabama Dent Repair performed a paintless dent repair (PDR) on the damage and the dent/ding has literally disappeared.  It exceeded my expectations of what could be done and I couldn't be happier!  I contemplated purchasing one of the PDR kits on Amazon and attempting the repair myself...  Then I thought better - \"Let a professional do it right the first time...\"  So glad I did!  For the price of a cheap PDR kit on Amazon, Alabama Dent Repair removed the dent/ding better than I ever could have hoped to.

On 3 July I took my GS350 to have the tint removed from my rear glass and have it replaced with ceramic tint that I purchased from tintzoom online for $200.00. When I arrived the owner and I agreed on a price of $190.00 to do all window with the exception of the left front and left rear (I had already installed it) with the tint I supplied. Having done over 50 tint jobs at a reputable local shop while in college (10 years ago) I know the proper way of installing tint, but being a little rusty I decided to take it to a professional to ensure the tint was removed properly (Steamer or Ammonia and Black Bag). After pulling the car into the shop to start the job I noticed the CARWASH DETAILER with a razor blade hacking at the tint in the rear window. I immediately asked him to stop and asked the owner to take over before he ruin the rear glass defroster. I then left with my ride that was waiting (big mistake) and had him take me to the bank to get cash for the job.  When I returned my car was supposedly ready. I looked at my rear package and it was covered with tint scrapings and my defrost lines were no longer black they were gold (as in no longer working from scraping with a razor). I also noticed that my 3rd brake light was torn to pieces, and there were several pieces of tint left on the window with new film laid on top of it. Soon after I spoke with the manager to inform him of my displeasure with the services rendered. The first thing I asked the owner about was my 3rd brake light and his answer was \u201cWe had to break it to put the film on.\u201d The second was my defroster his response was\u201d We had to get the tint off.\u201d The third issue with this humbling experience was the patches of old tint eft on the window with new tint installed over it, in which I received no response from the owner. My response to the owner was \u201cI am not paying for this,\u201d so he decided to vacuum some of the tint from the rear package tray and reduce the price to $165.00 since he broke my $250.00 3rd brake light. After I still refused to pay we both called the police (Little did he know I was on the phone with a good friend who is deputy chief of police). So between the times the police arrived he decided to rip the tint off the windows and throw my $200.00 ceramic tint in the trash, despite his wife warning him not to. When the police arrived he lied about ripping the tint off and even said I didn\u2019t bring any tint to him and stated that he supplied the tint. After looking at the car the officer asked why is there just tint on the driver side windows, I stated that is because those were the windows I did myself. To end the story the officers did nothing (OF COURSE) and stated it was a civil matter which is probably true. Long story short I am out $568.49 to replace the rear glass to get my defrosters back (plus installation), $200.00 for the ceramic tint that he decided to rip from the window and throw in the trash, and $250.00 for my 3rd brake light the he tore up. PLEASE do not go to the poor established called Customized Auto Detail & Window Tinting or you will receive a humbling experience like mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b785508b9fb:0xfffd9e0f9eb61f62"}

I took my vehicle here as recommended by a trusted friend. I purchased the highest level service they provided (well over $200), a \"full detail\" as they said. I had my vehicle there a full day with no pressure to have it done at any certain time, as i wouldn't be able to pick it up until i was out of work, well after they had closed. Upon arrival to pick it up, I was immediately concerned. It seemed as if they overlooked quite a few obvious areas. The front-end still had smashed insects and debris on it that easily came off with my fingernail. That lead me to look even closer. Using a flashlight, I noticed quite a few areas where wax was never removed, where hopefully condensation, and not unrinsed soap, dripped down, leaving behind hazy but obvious lines across the paint. The interior of my vehicle was outstanding, with the exception of the entire front winshield being ignored and unclean. I am just disappointed. I apologize in !\nadvance for not having enough faith in this shop to bring my vehicle back there, even for them to correct these issues.

First of all, not one point that her made was articulated to me or to my husband.  Just because you are busy (South Alabama in the heat), doesn't mean you handle your business well.\nI just say buyer beware.  If you need warranty work later due to poor placement or product, you will not be a priority.  Cash talks.  Also, this was a very hot day and my car sat for three hours after being driven for an hour.  My offer stands at the very least to help you with your poor communication to your customers and lack of expectations being stated.\n\nAppointments here may be firm on the customer\u2019s calendar, but it is OPTIONAL to the business owner.\n\nWe made an appointment for 0800 on our day off, a day to usually sleep in just a bit, and arrived on time for a scheduled front window tint replacement on one car and rear window tint replacement on the other. Rear tint has bubbled significantly from original install on my car.\n\nFirst car done by 0915. Instead of breathing down the owners neck, we said we would run some errands or grab a bite to eat while he worked on my car.\n\nAs soon as we were pulling out, they pulled a four door red sedan into the bay. I turned to Rob and said, \u201cWe have an appointment, what about my car?\u201d  Rob thought they could pull two cars in the bay and do the work simultaneously. That may be true, but it certainly wasn\u2019t my car they pulled in behind the sedan.\n\nWe arrived approximately three hours later to pick up my car, which was sitting in the same place I left it and was untouched. To say I was frustrated is the understatement of the year.\n\nI asked the owner about our scheduled appointment and he very nonchalantly said \u201cwe don\u2019t always keep the cars in order of appointment.\u201d WHAT?!?!\n\nLessons learned:\nAppointments are a suggestion not a firm time to conduct agreed upon work as scheduled.\n\nWarranty work (bubbled original ceramic tint) goes to the back of the line, despite having a confirmed appointment.\n\nNew customers do not need an appointment because you can just slide into the appointment made by a warranty customer-DON\u2019T WORRY!!!\n\nI have taught service most of my career. In this economy, I would expect much better service and a commitment to a returning customer even if it was for warranty work.  PRO TIP for ProTint-satisfied return customers are loyal customers that will recommend you to their friends and acquaintances.\n\nI would rather the guy tell me to my face that there is no way he is going to honor my appointment if he has cash coming in-honesty, I can deal with rationally.\n\nHis attitude was not apologetic and instead was very nonchalant.\n\nI will not be recommending this business to anyone.\n\nI am the most understanding and benevolent person that you will ever meet; however, not when being blown off and taken for granted.\n\nShame on you ProTint. Very poor service. Let me know if you need some business coaching!\n\nBTW-third automobile tinted here.\n#bottomline", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620658895044, "text": "\u201cWe don\u2019t always keep cars in the order of appointment\u201c was not said AT ALL.  That\u2019s a total fabrication.\n\nWhat WAS said was (multiple times), was \u201cremovals are not given a guaranteed time frame\u201d.  Ever.\n\nYou also can not remove window film from a cold back window on a BMW (so, baking in the sun is one of many steps required). If a vehicle is not ready for certain steps, it must wait until it is.  If you attempt to pull film off a cold BMW window, it will also pull the defroster lines with it.  If destroying the lines is acceptable, we could have accommodated that, but we prefer not to damage something.\n\nWe also \u201cnever\u201d (99%+ of the time) do any warranty work on Saturdays.  Saturdays are exclusively for straight installs. We made an exception (for not just one, but TWO vehicles). We do to take warranty\u2019s without a receipt (we made an exception. You may have one, we haven\u2019t seen it).  We NEVER remove film if we did not install it.\n\nYou did not mention that the vehicle that WAS done, was a \u201cwarranty\u201d that ONLY ProTint will do.  You broke a windshield on a SUBARU BRZ and we tinted the new windshield with the 85% clear ceramic for $0.00, under our exclusive warranty (which would normally be $150.00+), 100% free replacement is nearly unheard of.  With any other shop.\n\nANY retint comes with NO completion time guarantee.  That has been the policy for 30 years, will continue to be so.\n\nThe order that vehicles are pulled into the shop is of no one\u2019s concern other than staff.  The car that was pulled in at 9am (Dodge Charger) was already an hour late on starting, they also drove from out of the area and paid in advance, and had to wait in person.  The BRZ (that was not being charged for) was stacked in on top of their spot.\n\nWhile we can appreciate your frustration, that doesn\u2019t change that window tinting is not a snap your fingers and it\u2019s done type of process.  Redo\u2019s in particular take MANY hours.  Some take more than an entire day (which is why we stopped doing them).  Waiting around (or leaving for just a little while) for a REDO is not something that can be done.\n\nI appreciate the business coaching offer, but being being booked 3 weeks out, we can\u2019t take any further work.  We will stop trying to help people out, but putting them into an already full schedule though."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d97bf9ca9b1:0x109fe5102a5eb9b3"}

I\u2019ve had at least 10 cars tinted and re tinted in my lifetime and this is by far the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. On April 23rd I dropped my car off the night before so it could be done the first thing the next morning Damien the new owner assured me that they had plenty of time to get it done. After I waited around all day I finally call and ask about my car around 5pm he said it will be done shortly so my family went to eat to kill some more time. At 730pm! I get a text that it\u2019s about done. At 9pm! I get another text saying it\u2019s about done so I went ahead and went there. Still not done! Didn\u2019t get my car till 10pm! And when I got it you can just tell when something was rushed. I keep my car spotless when I got it back glue was everywhere! And after looking at the tint (in the first 4 pictures)the tint didn\u2019t go all the way into the gaskets and the front windshield didn\u2019t go all the way up! Also cluster bubbles everywhere! I know some are expected but they where horrible. After talking to him the next day he wanted to make it right and I agreed because I felt he would do a way better job next time. Wrong! On May 2nd took my car back around 10am so they could get it back to me at a decent time. 6pm! Told me to come get it when I went there still wasn\u2019t done! The tint now didn\u2019t go to the back of the rear gaskets in 3 out of 4 windows! And debris all in my back window! Including tint coming off the top of my front window which he said I need to leave up for 3 days! I\u2019ve never heard of that so I did and that happened when I finally rolled them down(The last 6 photos posted) I texted him the pictures and called he avoided me. So I needed a witness to go there with me I showed him Everything again and he said it needed touched up and one window would need re done. He said the way my windows move is why he couldn\u2019t get them to go all the way into the gaskets. And said nothing could be done about that. Lies! After asking for a refund because he said nobody could do a better job he just starred at my car and my dad said what if someone can do a better job and we will bring you the bill. He said ok. Well I went somewhere else and had it redone they did everything I wanted the right way! I called and texted him about a refund and he said because they took his film off he is keeping my money! $325. Bottom line if you are a business that offers a %100 guaranteed job or if your customer is not happy you refund them! So just think twice about going here it isn\u2019t the same place it was a few years ago.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9owakAOQ74gMkaXunLS8GVzZSJtWrSkwDkGsn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtqVVMYP7bTAxO_sQ5uE_sVJmaeOQtz07D3ZVL=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlJUKSI4YOUOu6w1x4ocb0HilXFF1bLimC-Tfo=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn_65arRPjYGra7h12EQTk9jE6k_zcLAPjAM5v=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdbVvn-TujBJbRv9_LN6C9eA_vYqcVxqUCvCUQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOEJHJFUI7Xo3NEPthz4f0NF6mRzRh8MZ4jDt4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5gTU_DunMecoWJCLty0ksSsDgx8c0FFB-RBaw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVO5brPlAEg9CX-d1w3DK6m64oKUZpJaokvwYl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0OJo8nrO9QuN9YgkRnUyNgZWS_DRAjAWza7FM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgBdJSeU4d2FLN8R7Xs1YpTe5heMFseOB_o4ml=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn3H4F_nofoC5YR70ShKq83w6IZL1WF9rfgbmE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43bd359e1233:0xcc37a4e6bb9592ca"}

I was always hesitant about getting one done because I would be out money and it wouldn't look perfect.\n\nJames the owner of Hi Tech tint walked me through the whole process from beginning to end. I never felt like I was getting over on either. He's a real personable person who cares just as much about the car as you do.\n\nMy tint job is flawless. I had one window that had bubbles form and James took the car and said \"we are going to make this right.\" He re did the window and now it's just amazing. He has a lifetime warranty on all his tint and his work which really put my mind as ease.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this place. He's a real stand up guy who knows what he's doing. He takes care of your car and uses high quality tint. If the job doesn't look right the first time he will get it right for you and even answers the phones after business hours.\n\nThis place is an A+ by my standards. Thank you so much for the job you did on my beautiful car.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888861699c50c3e7:0x763b0721c21c9a82"}
