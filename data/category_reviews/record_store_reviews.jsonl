We are very aware that leavi g guitars plugged in drai s the battery. That was NOT the case here. We took it out and found they had installed a promotional  Progressive Insurance smoke detector battery in it. Instead of what we are used to getting, Energizer or Duracell. I called and was told that we should have told them we wanted a better battery. It cost us more than $30 for the strings and a battery replacement. No offer to replace it. The lady said they just use whatever is \"handy\". I don't pay for what's handy. So much for being Pro's. If the lady had simply apologized, that would have been the end of it. I wasn't looking for anything other than to let them know that a substandard battery had been installed. When we brought it in initially, we asked for the strings to be changed and the battery replaced. No one told us at that time that we weren't being charged for the battery, just that what we asked for was $30, if I had been advised of that I would have either asked for a better battery or brought my own. I hung up when her tone told me how disgusted she was that I called with a problem. As for my other reviews of other businesses you mentioned, I review honestly and fairly. If you notice, I have many very positive reviews of several companies in the area. I managed customer service depts with 4 Fortune 500 Companies in my career.
