I showed concern that I have not received any possible delievery date and asked to speak to the store manager about finding another item with tbe same value that is available. Finally the store manager, (after I was concerned) said that it should be here the first week of June. I decided to not find a replacement since the manager seemed to be sure the furniture will be there. I called after the first week of June since I received no contacted in regards to delivery or any issues. Manager than proceeded to say it is now pushed to the first week of July. I received a call last week and the week prior telling me that my furniture was scheduled for first week of July. After first week of July passed, I called them Monday, July 12th, to be informed that it was again pushed to the week of July 26th. I asked the sales associate if I could get a full refund because their poor communication. And customer service makes me uneasy and I do not trust them that they will delivery my item. The manager was not there and the person said he will contact me on Wednesday when he returns. They told me that refund would not be possible because of the 72 hour no cancellation. I proceeded to call cooperate to file a complaint on their store and because it is privately owned they could not help me. They filed a complaint and said they will get in contact with me within 24-48 hours. After I received no response from cooperate and the store, I called cooperate again. During the process of calling cooperate on Friday, July 16th (less than four days since the last conversation with the store) I found out that the corner of my section is in the warehouse but that other pieces will be in august 26th. Again another time pushed and no response. Each time the dates have been undetermined or pushed further. There is no promise of a secure date. They are persistent on telling me cancellations are not possible due to the 72 hours after full purchase but yet this company does not hold themselves accountable to communication and delivery if their items. After long conversation, the sales associate on Friday, July 16th said the manager will issue a request for cancellation to the finance department and I will receive a paper check refund. I called today July 20th to ask about the status. The request was given to the finance department and now waiting for the finance department to contact me about my refund. The sales associate said that it will take up to 14 days. This is ridiculous. I understand that we are in Covid 19 times. But their customer service is lacking and their concern for their customers is lacking.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626881260419, "text": "Hello Ms. Dagalea.

I called Emmitt, the store manager, and requested for them to return to pick up the dresser, needless to say the dresser remained in my home for three weeks. I tried to contact the general manager, Nick on two occasions and, Emmitt was of no assistance and he never returned my phone calls either. After finally getting a scheduled pickup a week and a day later, the delivery team was an hour and 15 minutes late with once again no phone call or text. After posting my experience on their Facebook page, Nick called leaving a message with my phone number as the return contact. Also, someone from their management team left an email address that was not accurate. I say all this to say, my concerns have not been resolved and I did not receive the correct dresser that I paid for.

Josh and I agreed on a (out the door) price that he stated would included free delivery and would include the best warranty that I could purchase. Once I got to the register to check out I was charged an additional 199.00 that was supposed to have been already applied to our agreed upon total. I didn't notice until after I left and looked over the receipt of this infraction. They told me that the set wasn't in stock and would take 3 weeks to be delivered. I offered several time to pick the set up myself but they insisted that I let them bring it out and set it up for free so I agreed. They told me that the set would come in a different dates and offered me split delivery. I told them I'd prefer if we just wait an get it all delivered at 1 time when it all arrived and they agreed. Fast forward to Thursday April 8th I called and was told that only 2 pieces were in but they were all scheduled to be there the week of the 8th. Friday the 9th I called bk and was told that the set was there. I asked when would it be delivered and was told that I had to come pick it up and that it wouldn't be delivered. Therefore I (rented) a haul and angrily went to to their store to pick it up. Once I got there I was told that it wasn't there and was at the warehouse which contradicted everything that I was told and wasn't where I originally paid for the set. At this point I was furious and Josh wasn't there so I was told. They then called him/Josh and he magically appeared from the back of the store smiling with mischief all over his face. Once he got close enough to see the anger in my eyes he detoured behind me and finally stood behind the counter accompanying the other 2 young ladies. He lied and tried to tell me that I wasn't given or offered free delivery but one of the assistants who also helped me select the set( she in particular was great and very helpful and even apologized) agreed that I was supposed to have free delivery. I then told him about the split delivery in which I knew nothing about until they offered and he dropped his head knowing that I was being honest. At this point I was furious but still needed my set. They then told me that it was at the warehouse and that the warehouse was closed. This is after they told me that it was at their location and I had to come pick it up. So now I'm standing there with a rented uhaul, being double charged for a warranty, furious and still not able to get my furniture. Long story short I still have to go pick it up again today. I would've canceled it all together but your charged a  25% restocking fee and can't return it over 3 days after the original purchase date. Josh continued to try and lie and say he told me this or that and I made him out to be a lie everytime. Josh is a lier so don't let those fb commercials fool you. My set was over 4k and paid upfront. Read over your receips as soon as you get it and make sure everything you agreed upon is stated and accurate. This is my personal experience, hopefully this will detour you from having a disastrous nightmare just as I did. Please shop else where. Hopefully everything goes smooth today once I go to pick it up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618330066688, "text": "Hello Mr. Gipson. Firstly, I would like to apologize for any miscommunications or any tribulations experienced with the Ashley Homestore Outlet. From my understanding of the matter, there were many miscommunications on the team's behalf. I am not sure why there was so much confusion with the Customer Service on this particular order, and this will be addressed to them. We are experiencing delays on orders due to covid, and though this is a common response for almost all things furniture nowadays, it is honestly the truth. Again, I would like to apologize for the lack of communication resulting in you prematurely renting a U-haul. Our Warehouse hours differ from the store hours, and this should have been addressed upfront ahead of time. I truly feel that if things had been communicated better, a lot of these issues would have been easily resolved, and that is our fault. On behalf of the company we hope you will accept our apology, and please feel free to discuss this matter further at cescalations@ahsmal.com, and a manager will respond.  With all this said, we want to thank you for shopping with us and appreciate you being a member of our community. We are striving daily to improve our business to ensure that things like this no longer happen."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2dfc4bb7ecc9:0x341dd06834bfbb31"}

We were greeted by a salesman named Alex. He seemed to be a nice guy well versed and educated in product knowledge of everything they had to showcase and sell. We instructed him that we were just looking but we'd come back if we were interested in doing business. He and his manager promised exceptional customer service. We came back about a month later ready to purchase. We spent almost $7,000 with this salesman and company and was sold several empty promises. We were told that we'd have all of our furniture at the store ready to be delivered to our brand new home that we were building by the first week of December. That didn't happen. We were promised several different customer service calls concerning our furniture. They never happened. In December we were told for 3 weeks straight that our stuff was coming and it didn't come. Finally we got some of our things only to find out that as our stuff was coming off the truck that the delivery guys forgot the mounts to put our mirror up that goes to our dresser. Also that Alex ordered 2 loveseats instead of a sofa and loveseat. When I called to make him aware of his mistake I was told immediately that it was my fault as if I made up the invoice myself. I spoke with the manager Josh he apologized and put in a new invoice for a new sofa. He said that our recliner which we are still waiting on would be here the same time the sofa would, which would be Jan. 15th. I was told that if anything changed that I would receive a call. Guess what? That didn't happen either. After the delivery guys left I noticed that they messed up my front door casing in 2 different places. I called this Thursday to inform them of the damage and check to make sure everything was still on track and yet again I was given the run around by the employees and manager Josh as to when my stuff would arrive. Finally he said that yet again its been pushed back to the first week in February. He gave me Ashley's customer service email to send proof of damage and I was told I would receive a call or email concerning the damages as you might've guessed THAT! DIDN'T! HAPPEN!  Before ending our call he said he was going to give me a call the next day at 9:30 when he starts his customer service calls and you guessed it IT NEVER HAPPENED! Mind you we placed our entire order at one time in OCTOBER!!! We were told that there was a 6-8 week wait to receive our stuff which we were fine with because our home would be finished being built by then. It's now January and still were being given the run around. I have never experienced such unprofessionalism, deplorable customer service, and lies by a company who's standards are supposed to be way above par. I am livid and hate that I ever gave this company my business. They care nothing about their customers only about the quick buck that they can get. I wouldn't advise anyone to ever do business with this establishment. Your just another sale to them and they give you nothing but empty promises. If I could've given no stars I would have!
