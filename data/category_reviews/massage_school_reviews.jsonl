Lisa has given me massages off and on and specifically through both of my pregnancies and it helped tremendously.  She runs an honest business and works hard.  I am a physical therapist and I know her techniques are skilled.  She gets to know your body and how you respond and gives the massage accordingly.  She wants to know what is too hard or not hard enough.  I think her prices are reasonable.  The facility is simple which is what I like.  If you want a Spa experience, you can pay for that somewhere else.  I just like a good massage and then go about my business.  The staff is nice and kind and they seem like family to each other.  If I have to leave a message she always calls back as soon as she can and has reasonable options for appointments.
