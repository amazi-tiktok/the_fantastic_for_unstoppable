When he purchased the bow through a dealer in TN he had after market Flo green strings put on. Last summer he decided to switch back to the original Elite strings. He went into full draw to have them put them on and tune his bow. He has been here several times before purchasing a wide variety of archery goods. The man that put his new strings on did not put serving on the string that comes in contact with his string stop, ruining his strings. My husband put off going back in until hunting season was over not wanting to be with out his bow. He finally made it in and talked to the same guy that put his strings on. He acted like he had never met my husband before and denied doing any such thing claiming that it could not of been him because they are factory strings. My husband explained the situation again and he just brushed him off. He reluctantly put serving on my husbands damaged strings that should have been done the first time only to get home and realize he didn't even adjust back his vudu string stop so his sting was hitting outside of the stop. On top of that everything we have bought there has been overpriced but we justified it because we do prefer to shop local. If you want a fair priced honest place to go. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. Just make the trip to Cullman.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUBSBaoOH3cYdCaPJTDzPZDxPzvVhZKySd78cg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b3ee92e2b2f:0xa140aaa25d52a4d3"}
