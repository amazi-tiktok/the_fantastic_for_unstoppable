I ordered a large hot latte but what I got I have no idea. It was the worst latte I'd ever had. At first I thought it was just weak coffee and the guy just forgot what I ordered but I'm  not sure if it was even that. It was frothy so he got the milk part right I just don't know about the rest of it.  I did think at the time he made it awfully quick and I commented on that to him after all a 2 shot espresso latte takes a few minutes to make. I guess he must of just left out my 2 shots. Waste of $4.  I would have return to cafe but I  was almost home before I tried the drnk and I don't live in Arab.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602795478626, "text": "I\u2019m so sorry that you didn\u2019t enjoy your coffee!
