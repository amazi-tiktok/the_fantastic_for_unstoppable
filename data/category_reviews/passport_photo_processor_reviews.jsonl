I was shipping to packages off today, one to my mortgage company and another to At&t. When I got to the counter the representative told me that AT&T system was down but she would check to see if  it was back up and running. It was still down so she directed me to the UPS store about 1.2 miles away and I went to go get in the car to call ATT before going to UPS to see if this was a outage all over it just Fedex Kinkos. The ATT representative told me they didn\u2019t have a issue so I go back in the store to see if their system was back up. A older lady that I helped in the store before leaving stopped me and said the Caucasian guy behind me earlier had a package he was shipping back to At&t as well. The representative told him that the system was down but she would hold it for him and ship it when the system came back up. I asked the representative when I walked back in the store was the system back up, she replied no it\u2019s still down. I asked could she hold my package and ship it when it come back up, she replied they aren\u2019t allowed to do this.\n\nI replied but you just did it for the Caucasian man who was sending a package to At&t to. She looked shocked!  She replied she isn\u2019t suppose to do that but my problem is you did do it & he was behind me. You sent me to UPS but you didn\u2019t send him! Do you know how this makes me feel (small very small) because I\u2019m Black I can go to UPS but because he is white you can hold it for him and ship it later. I have always used fedex and I\u2019m very disappointed in how I was discriminated against today but you guys will be hearing from me soon.

However, since she is no longer in the store, if they accept my perfectly good boxes, I will use this branch again.  if not, I will continue to ship through my employer.\n\nPREVIOUS POST: This used to be my favorite shipper and favorite FED EX location.  I even have my own personal Fed Ex account.  However about a year ago Fed Ex must have brought in a new female day manager or supervisor and she behaves like a shrew.  I was believe her name was Helen.  She misquotes Fed Ex's shipping policy and refuses to use \"banker's\" boxes and other good boxes that are actually more sturdy than she sells at that outlet. She says it is FedEx's policy and I have since found out - it is not FedEx policy, but may be the individual store policy.  But she says it is FedEx policy.  However, she is most loud and belligerent and actually refuses to ship unless in boxes \"like she sells\" and pulls off the shelf \"because Fed Ex will no longer accept those boxes\".  Not true.  She won't accept the boxes.  She claims my boxes are not as sturdy (not true) and it is FED EX's policy not to accept those boxes.  Not true.  I've checked Fed Ex's shipping and packing policies and my boxes are very acceptable...and they are more sturdy than the boxes she is trying to force me to buy.  I will no longer ship there but ship through my work and have the charges deducted form my payroll.  Fed Ex is happy to pick up my boxes at my work without trying to make me buy boxes from Fed Ex.  My work place ships many boxes like my boxes (that's where I get my boxes) without any problem.  Someone needs to retrain or terminate the weekday supervisor or manager at this office.  I have read of many complaints about the personnel at FedEx-Kinko locations since Kinko and Fed Ex combined their locations.  I will not go back to this location with Helen there.  When I can't use my work place for shipping (as when the boxes too heavy for me to take in), I have driven 35 miles round trip to drop off my boxes elsewhere instead of dealing with this unpleasant person...what a shrew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b9130ca25b5:0x5bd40fa6ae8c11d"}

They don\u2019t always have a ton of USPS supplies, which is ok but I\u2019d do anything over having to go to the post office, and their prices are almost highway robbery. I get they have to mark up services, and for the most part shipping has become so expensive they are just passing along the cost, but it\u2019s consistently very expensive to just take a box there to pay to ship if you are going UPS/FedEx. If so, get a prepaid label and drop it off, it\u2019s just way too expensive. USPS prices are pretty standard so if sending Priority Mail just use a flat rate and ship from there.\n\nOutside shipping they have a great mail box service that will allow you to get an address that isn\u2019t a PO Box but functions just like one.
