I live in Atlanta, Georgia and this breeder is in Alabama.   Roger (I hope I spelled his name correctly) is the man who raises the puppies.  He\u2019s also so honest!!  He doesn\u2019t take advantage of people, I know this because he did not take advantage of me.  And he very easily could have.  I gave him my credit card \ud83d\udcb3 information in order to save a Specific dog \ud83d\udc3e for my chosen trainer, Jen, to choose from his litter, when My puppy is born.  Jen, the dog trainer in Georgia, is confident that Roger\u2019s puppies/Rock Springs Labs,  will be excellent, you see. So I called him to put a deposit down.\n\nJen  is also aware that, as I have a traumatic brain \ud83e\udde0 injury.  I\u2019m extremely impulsive.  I feel desperate for a dog, as my Labradore, Love, of 16 years, is no longer alive on this earth.  I\u2019d given him my visa # and Information after talkIng to him only once.\n\nJen talked to him at one point.  She told me he wasn\u2019t going to run my Visa deposit  it yet.\n\nJen, the honest trainer who I\u2019m choosing,  and I and maybe Katie, will drive up to Alabama when the puppies  are born.  Jen tells me she will be there selecting my puppy, using something like 10 different dog assessment tests to choose the exact one that will be  just for me and the puppy will be at something like 8 weeks of age when she\u2019ll Know if any of the puppies are right just for me, after we drive to Alabama one day.\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\n\nI am so glad that I have chosen Jen as my trainer and have chosen this\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e Rock Springs Labs \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3ebreeder.  He really is a sweet man.  \ud83d\udc3e\n\nI believe that Roger is waiting till Jen finds the right dog for me.   I can barely wait to get a therapy dog / service dog in from Rock Springs.   This man, Rock Springs Labs, also knows his dogs \ud83d\udc3ewell, Jen says.  (There is also a man named John who is involved at the Rock Springs Labs breeder.  I just talk to Roger because Jen gave me his number.)  I believe this breeder is also helping out veterans with the dogs.  Be sure and ask Rock Springs Labs all about \ud83d\udc3ethemselves, they know what they are doing.  I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m trusting Jen and that I\u2019m trusting Rock Springs.  I still miss my 16 year young Black Labrador named Love.   I know no other dog will be exactly like her.   I believe in this breeder and that he has extra excellent dogs.\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889ea68ba99409f:0x366fede12cfca540"}
