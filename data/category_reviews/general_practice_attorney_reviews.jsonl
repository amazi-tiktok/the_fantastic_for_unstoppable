The analysis and letters that you received were of excellent quality. As to the communication, you sent me an email that I was not able to respond to while in court. I did contact you once I was out of court. We discussed this and you seemed to understand. As a litigation attorney I cannot stop trials or hearings for the sake of emails.

He listened to my story, he cared and he made sure he did everything in his power to get the outcome I truly deserved. In Warren\u2019s words I was \u201ca true success story\u201d and he wasn\u2019t going to let that go without being heard. He went over and beyond by meeting with the District Attorney multiple times to discuss my case. Even after negotiating a plea deal that I never dreamed possible, he still went back AGAIN and laid my story out \u2013 showing how I had turned my life around \u2013 and getting me an even better deal than before.
