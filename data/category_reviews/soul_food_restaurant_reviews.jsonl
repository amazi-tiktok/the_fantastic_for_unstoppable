I called in today 8/16 to make sure they have pork chops because last time I was told they were out. The woman on the phone says yes and never once said they are cooked to order nor is this listed anywhere on the menu( I called because so live 20 minutes away) once I get there they drop pork chops after me waiting in line for 15 minutes. 15 minutes later when my chops are ready is when they decide to tell me the things they are out of. So I say okay thank you I don't want anything as literally they were out of everything I wanted. I called upon leaving to make a suggestion that it should be listed on the menu that pork chops are made to order and that you all should have a sign of the things you are out of close to where you order and the woman was very dismissive, discourteous and extremely unprofessional. I will not spend another dime of my money here after spending a total of 50 minutes on this experience(driving there and then the wait time in restaurant) to leave with nothing. A few recommendations so you don't lose other faithful customers: List the things that are made to order on your menu, or let customers know when they call in. Have a list or sign of things that you have ran out of and train your employees to not raise their voice and be dismissive of customers.

Great food, service, and hospitality. I was greeted when I came in, at a funny off hour after lunch, around 2:00 pm or so and told to sit where I wanted. I was greeted by the waiter who was super friendly and knew their menu well. I ordered some of my favorites when I can find them, regular southern food items that when seasoned correctly and cooked right, are a delight to the taste buds and stomach. Well I got my wish without having to even ask. From the first bite on, I was in heaven as there was perfection in the flavors and combination. I didn't want to stop eating and I didn't leave any on my plate either. It was wonderful. I sincerely hope if you're in the area, that you will stop in and try it. I had business next door at the Astro Tops shop. But since it was a while since I ate I wanted to get something quick as I had to get on the road down to Mobile. This place made me want to find a reason to stay in the area so I could eat there again, it was that good. The water there, and it's the city, caused the tea to have a slight off flavor but it was still fine. But the food was WONDERFUL. I'll be back, it was worth it and then some.
