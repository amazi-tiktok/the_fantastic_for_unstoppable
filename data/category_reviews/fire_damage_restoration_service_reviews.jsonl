If you get nothing else from my review, get this: use anyone but Landmark.\n\nThis company dragged my relatively small project on for months. The employees are nice enough, but are unbelievably slow and inept. More than once, I had to call the main office to \"tattle\" on Ben, the project manager, who had gone totally AWOL and would not communicate despite my house being in complete disarray thanks to his project management.\n\nInstalling quarter round proved too difficult for this company. They had to come out over 4 separate times to complete this job. They literally skipped parts of the wall because there was furniture or a floor mat in front of it. They skipped the kitchen entirely. And when they did return to install it there, they literally just left giant gaps in each corner without joining the pieces together. They were dumbfounded that I wanted the quarter round to join at the corners. WTF!\n\nThey destroyed 2 toilet lids by putting tools on them.  They re-seated toilets crooked and rocking and leaking.  They left the closet bolts uncovered and did a caulking job you'd expect from a toddler.\n\nThere are places in the laminate floor with visible gaps between planks. There were gouges in it that they filled with wood filler and called it a day. They did a sloppy paint job in both bathrooms (at least they got the color right, though).\n\nIt was unbelievable how many times these people had to come back to my house to fix their screw-ups and even now, a year later, I'm still finding fresh, mind-boggling issues.\n\nIf you care about your house at all, use someone else.\n\nI would like to add that the owner of the company did reach out to me within 24 hours of my review with apologies and an offer to make it right.

I wish he would have been the project manager on my rebuild. However on the rebuild side.. not so much.. said project manager who I will not mention he knows who he is did not communicate well with the contractors on my rebuild. I had to fix AC vents myself that said project manager had told contractors to fix as I told them not to take down. they taped around them and when they took tape off. they ripped em out... they had no knowledge of it to fix them and were not told.. They damaged my drawer in my kitchen and tried to blame me for it. Broke my kitchen faucet as they should have taken the faucet from the sink.. Instead I find my sink on the floor all willy nilly . On the paint process they puled nails and picture hooks and patched but on other areas they just painted over the pic hooks and so forth. They also painted without using drop cloths on my wood floors and set a paint tray on my wood floor without a drop cloth under it. and I will have to pay someone to pressure wash my front sidewalk as they got paint spatters everywhere when they were cutting and working outside.. They did fix the items in question, drawer faucet and cabinets. but project manager said we will go thru this during the walk thru.. To me it would make sense to take care of this BEFORE THE walk thru.. I am visually impaired and I am glad I had friends to point out stuff they needed to fix.. They got it all fixed but it should have never come to that had the project manager been on the ball. Y'all need to put me on the payroll for this job. and he charged me for a Dump truck that did not get used for hauling away debris.. This was a rebuild no debris to haul away. He got snappy and angry.. \"I am not taking that truck charge off\"  and took it personally when I questioned the Dump truck charge. I am not trying to nickel and dime anyone I just expect things to be as they were before it happened. Said project manager was very aloof and uncaring or understanding. I might be legally blind but I am not stupid. If I was totally blind with no help my place would have been totally jacked up after the sign off. and lastly they put my upper kitchen cabinets in crooked.They had to pull and put in correctly... who does not use a level when putting in cabinets. Very hasty sloppy work that should have been done right the first time.  I understand that folks try to get over on folks like y'all but I just wanted stuff done right..

Work was scheduled soon after and workers removed the affected materials within a couple of hours and left a very large dehumidifier, four or five air handlers and a couple of HEPA filter units. After three days of continuous noise and tripped circuit breakers the walls were dried out, my allergies started clearing up and I was a happy camper.\n\nPhase 2: Dustin Hunt came to the house to survey the \"damage\" take measurements and pictures, then provided a detailed estimate for reconstruction of the dining room walls.

Drew one of the sales guys made up stories about the situation, told my tenant I had told him things when I hadn't even talked to the guy yet and told two different things ones to me and my tenant .I asked Drew why he did this and let him know I would be calling the office and  he proceeded to call my tenant a couple of times and send me a  6 page text over the situation which I found very unprofessional . When I called to complain about this Jacob the owners son took  up for the actions, was rude to me, did not listen to me and acted like I was bothering him.I was told my cabinets needed replaced when they did not. They pulled the vanity out of my master bathroom that did not need pulled out to begin with  without cutting the caulk and when they pulled the vanity it caused the mirror in the bathroom to fall on the sink shattering my mirror and busting my sink in the bathroom and tried to blame it on the heat in the room.I called  David the head of the construction department several times asking a start date and was told no repairs would be started  until they had 18 thousand upfront, Half the cost, and to ask my adjuster to call  his cooperate office and have Fed Ex deliver it to them.I asked my adjuster about it and he said that they did not that money upfront and was beyond shocked I had been told that.They still have their little lock box on my door a week after I told them I will not be using their services anymore, I have called four times to ask to have removed.I have called and asked  three times to speak to the owner of the franchise and got no response. The office staff is not friendly, they have horrible attitudes and make you feel  brushed off.  Brandy the girl in the office is very rude and  blows me off and acts like I'm a bother to her when I call to ask to speak to a manager or owner  . This is the most unprofessional company I have ever came into contact with in my life. And I strongly suggest people think  twice before using them for any reason. You will regret it if you  use this company, trust me on that.They thought since it was an insurance claim they would  take me for a run and rob me and  my insurance company blind and have caused me nothing  but a headache and  added stress from what happened to my home.\n\nChelsea\ndon't know how to reply to you  but this way.

But then everything got very confusing. We didn't know what was going to happen or when. Then they came in and packed all of our things up, first our clothes and no one told us to keep out any clothes. So we had no clothes blankets or pillows by the time they finished. There was 2 rooms that just had to be cleaned but they threw out our beds and furniture and took out all the carpet. We put notes on two closets and put don't enter.. I found the notes in the floor when we returned. They packed up everything and took it with them but nothing was cleaned it was just in the box they had packed it in.\nThey told us they we're going to clean the duck work, it was not cleaned, the ceiling fans were not cleaned nor were the blinds. We have had to just  about replace everything  we own plus we had use or own  money to eat at the hotel for   for over 2 months. Being nice is great but we had to many people telling us different things..it took a month after we got to come home before they started bring things back. It made difficult to cook. We had to buy new pots just fry an egg.\nWhen they finally brought things back they were very confused about everything because the young guy and 3 woman that packed us up were fired. They didn't seem to know what was ours and what wasn't.  There are quite a few things missing.  Some of the items are antique and can't be replaced.  The thing is these items problem  went to someone else  and they just saw it was old and not there's. Maybe I need to go check the thrift store.  I didn't think this was going to be easy but this has been a nightmare. I have items that have tags on them, but they didn't take them or clean them. My blinds still have soot on them and it is not easy to clean. They we're supposed to clean and check or duct work , not even touched. And we saw the check our insurance sent them and that was way too much for this mess.

My first dealing with Rick-N-Ball Restoration + Construction, Inc. was in October 2019 when they modified my back patio.  The work included designing and constructing an outdoor fireplace, building a roof over the entire patio and covering it with metal panels.  Their work was outstanding and completed on schedule.  My second experience was definitely unplanned and occurred after the main water line into my home started leaking.  Upon detection I immediately contacted Rick-N-Ball for assistance / guidance as I knew they worked closely with USAA and other insurance companies to mitigate water damage and reconstruct accordingly.  Shortly after contacting them Andrew arrived with a plumber and the source of this leak was quickly detected and repaired.  Kevin then guided me through the steps necessary to initiate a claim and continues to work with USAA on my behalf.  Their professionalism and genuine concern for the homeowner\u2019s worries made this ordeal a little more bearable.  Rick-N-Ball has completed restoration and I cannot even tell there was a leak to begin with.

For two weeks, we checked every\nday, no workmen.  We were assured we would be back in by Christmas.  We went through three Project Managers, and\nthree different set of drywall and painters.  The first painting crew stood on my washer and dryer to paint the\nceiling in the laundry leaving dents and scratches.  We had stored the liquor from our bar in tubs in the garage,\nas Servpro would not remove alcohol from the home.  Apparently the painters had found it and consumed a great deal\nbefore they were removed from the job by Darin Ingle.  They also got paint all over our floors so Servpro brought\nin commercial scrubbers which removed the finish on all of our floors.\n\nTo shorten this story, I will cut to the return home.  We finally returned to our home in early March with work still\ngoing on, Painting and damaged floors. The first night home the water under the sink of my brand new cabinets\nflooded the kitchen.  They had to send in dryers and a plumber who said it was not hooked up correctly and\nreworked all of the kitchen dishwasher and sink plumbing. They sent in a professional flooring company  to assess\nthe floors. Their solution required us to move back into a hotel for at least a week so they could clean, reseal\nthe tile and recolor the grout.\n\nThe only thing that saved this project was Darin Ingle who arrived on the project in February.  Darin was sent in from another state to resolve the\nproblems at the Montgomery location that included our home.  Darin took the reins, brought in new crews and came\nevery day to ensure the work got back on track and that it was done correctly.  Darin's arrival was months into\nthe project and while we have never sued anyone, we were on the verge of doing just that to get another company\nto come in so we could go home.  I am not sure if Servpro's executives realize that Darin not only saved our project,\nsaved them from a lawsuit but did an amazing job saving their reputation.  I would only call them again if Darin Ingle handled the job.\nBecause of Darin, I am giving Servpro a 2 star rating and Darin a 5.\n\nAn update to my review.  I was contacted by Mr. Bowen, an owner.  Mr. Bowen was determined to do something to do something for All we had been through.  He offered to send in a crew or something.  While his offer was appreciated, we had already fixed many of the issues and did not feel we could ensure another work crew I agreed to think it over and get back with him.  The one thing, as I explained to him, that distressed me everytime I went into the laundry was the dents and scratches on the tops of the washer and dryer which he eagerly agreed to replace.  With much of manufacturing shut down for long periods, appliances are in short supply.  However, Mr. Bowen and Darin Ingle were able to replace order And have new ones installed.  My frustration is no longer renewed when I walk into my laundry room.  My thanks to Mr. Bowen for reaching out and making this a better experience, and to Darin Ingle for making it happen.  It is good to know they cared to make things better.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600260211243, "text": "Hi Judy, I am one of the owners and I am terribly sorry to hear about your experience.

My first quote I got for sewage removal, the guy who showed up to give me a quote was wearing khakis and loafers. He stuck his head in the crawl space and said $2500 to do the job. He didnt even fully inspect the job, he didnt want to get dirty. So, I called Restoration One to get a different quote. Jeff came out and put on a saftey suit and actually went in the crawl space to accuratley inspect the problem. Well he found a mold issue just beginning and brought it to my attention and also pointed out the reason i asked them to come, to check ansewage clean up, he said wasnt necessary for him to do if i had the time to do it myself. Cost me about $100, compared to $2500. So ofcourse I went with this company to do the mold removal. They were on time and respectful, always kept in touch and kept me up to date with the job. They did an excellent job. If you are in the position of trying to find a company who will be honest and not take advantage of you, this is the one. I used to work HVAC and they would push me to sell things that werent necessary, which I never liked to do. When I knew that wasnt thier agenda, i was sold.
