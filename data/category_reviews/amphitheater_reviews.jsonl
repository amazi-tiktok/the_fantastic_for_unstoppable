This is the 2nd year I have attended the 4th of July celebration with my family. Each trip is equally wonderful. The cost was $10 per person, which included 3.5 hours of live music and a 30 minute fireworks display that is in my opinion legendary. The grounds are very clean and we'll maintained. You can't be more safe, they have numerous officers from Russell Lands Security on hand, as well as countless County Deputies and enough fire and EMS personnel to handle any situation that may arise. Each service has their own tented area at the top of the hill and is easily identified. The personnel also maintain a high presence that is not only authoritative but very friendly especially to the children. The restroom facilities are actual buildings. They are well stocked, clean, ventilated and conveniently located from the venue viewing area. The view is unbelievable. The stage is front and center before the fireworks, but is moved to the side to give an unobstructed view of the fireworks and the lake. Its amazing to see the amount of boats that gather to listen to the music and watch the fireworks. When the lights go out, the lake looks like a sky full of stars with all the boat lights. If you have the opportunity to attend an event at the amp, go...... You wont be disappointed.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxb2Q9oZfjnP0EZby9FL6TyQZuA6dj8LgWLFjV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqrKBtV2XFhyeaAcvmbCOemZd2d7qMjOd8c27m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbm5T9Y_8TXDPFIeVGd3V0M1n3bEp3x8POcqpn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5gsGbSp-qrhESBfz8Vc7-VegC36XN4zXqnXvR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCcqj04zafkPD7hKGFmmiNc1Qfo8yDDVrlDp2w=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-kA9Qo28qxgPywBm_hjnDdYok3O-OgWxueWij=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyCKKml11NIQq2oBt-3OcwHeqd_26lqI0La7tS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c125f61ede3b1:0xd34e17b26d3e2dbc"}
