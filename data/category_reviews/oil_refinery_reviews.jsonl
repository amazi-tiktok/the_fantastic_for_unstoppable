I brought my car in a week ago because the front end of the car was not driving properly. RoadMart said that they could not replicate the issue but they did see I needed my tires balanced, I let them balance my tires and when I left I was having the same issues. I brought my car back and then they said the tires were  separating on the inside, so I paid 367 for four brand new tires. Replacing the tires only helped the car drive smoother but the problem was now worse! So I brought my car back today and now there saying that the back tires are the cause of the front tires shifting and that wasn't something they could fix, I would have to take it to the dealership. The guy said he could try to align the front to see if that would help but it made the issue even worse then when I had initially brought the car in. I am now sitting here after closing hours so they can set my alignment back to were it was. I just feel like if they were unable to repair the car in the first place then they should've said so instead of me coming out of 446 dollars for no reason. I asked if I could a refund for the alignment and the guy said that he wouldn't be able to refund me, would have to wait until next call and ask for a refund or he could credited as two free oil changes which is not acceptable for my inconvenience", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293c0a719e971:0x35d4a5b6c0bf8d4a"}
