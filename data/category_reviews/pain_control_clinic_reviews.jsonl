I needed an epidural for my lumbar spine (I hate taking pain meds). I had seen several doctors including an ER Dr. who all said the same thing\u2014get an epidural. So on the day of my appointment my wife drives me to the VA hospital and I decide to walk to the clinic (walking is good for your back). This clinic is located in one of Birmingham\u2019s housing projects filled with abandoned homes, halfway houses, thugs, and free range pit bulls. I show up to my 1PM appointment at 1130 knowing I will have paperwork to do. I wait until 1:30 before I am called back for a urinalysis and then promptly sent back out to the waiting room to continue waiting. This the closest I have ever felt to being a prison inmate. Apparently pain clinics are only for people who abuse medications\u2014at least, that\u2019s how you are treated. The new patient packet was thick and asked a lot of questions, when the \u201cnurse\u201d? Finally called me back she took my height and weight then asked me all the questions again (what a waste of time). Finally the Dr. comes in for 5 minutes give or take, tells me I have a screwed up back and that I should get an epidural..... then I\u2019m taken out to get everything scheduled for 3 epidurals over three months and an 8 week follow up. The first thing they could get me was 2 weeks later on the 24th. For the second epidural I tell the young lady that I would like to do the follow up on the same day, I have a 2 hour drive (one way) to get there and take off work. Now, I\u2019m no rocket scientist but 2 months is 8 weeks. I am told for insurance purposes they can\u2019t do both on the same day.(aka they can\u2019t bill me twice if I do it on the same day). Then I overhear the receptionists telling each other that they can\u2019t tell people that the billing company is in Texas..... They now have to say it\u2019s an outside company. All said and done this was hands-down the worst experience I have had (and I fought in two wars). I was made to feel like a criminal, had to wait a long time, ended up in a super bad area of town, was blatantly told they are gonna charge my insurance as much as possible even if it inconveniences me. They pushed full anesthesia instead of a local anesthetic which is the normal (assuming to squeeze my insurance for more money), and then instructing other employees to lie to customers.

I thought when I met Dr. Goyne I thought I had found the doctor I had always looking for, boy was I wrong. On my second visit  she cut my pain medicine in half and then I get a call that she is not going to give me medicine anymore without a reason .I feel I deserve a reason. Morgan always calls and so rude, she dont want to give me my pain pills but schedule a block for this week. I dont understand after being on this medication for 7 years from a bad car accident how she can just decide I dont need my medicine anymore but I need a pain block. Back to the charges they charge 200 per drug screen and $70 dollars everytime you fill out that tablet. I have decided to go to a suboxin  clinic and try to get off this medicine, I am tired of these doctor's thinking they are God and we are drug addicts. I didn't ask to get hit by a drunk driver.By the way I am not confused about anything I promise this practice will come to a halt, I am contacting everyone that is anyone, I understand the pricing etc! what I don't understand is how a doctor on the first visit makes you feel important and that she is going to help me and she did give me hope for the first time in years. On my first visit I told her I had been a marijuana smoker for 40 years and I had quit on 7-29-18 and seen Dr. Goyne on 8-21-18. I knew my drug test would come back dirty as it had not even been 30 days, she replied I don't usually write a prescription when a drug test is dirty but I believe you. My second visit on 9-19-18 my test was still dirty we looked it up and for a long term smoker it can take up to 100 days to get out of your fat cells. She then gave me half of my pain medication and was a complete doctor of which I first met. She made my next appointment for 11-3-18 to ensure I would be clean, upon checkout the girl called to ask about my prescription lapse and she was told that on the 19th I could pick up a prescription to last me till 11-3-18, Dr. Goyne assured me once my test came back clean she would resume my medication. After I get a call to go take a MRI which I did, the I was called to schedule a block, but at the same time I was told Dr. Goyne was not going to write me anymore pain meds and she called me in a prescription for withdraws and it cost $2200 hundred dollars. Insane, I have taken this medication since 2011 date of my auto accident, and this doctor takes a oath to do no harm which is exactly what she is done to me. She has lied promising she would resume my medication, and that i could pick up the prescription for the 10-20 to 11-03-18,, with no regards on how sick i am and how much worse it is going to be. Withdraw medication does not help with my injuries and the pain I live in. I am aware of your cost which are insane, I know this from my insurance company. So If i live thru this at my age after 7 years of use I will make it my mission to expose this company.\nSandra Pruitt", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9235b595d:0xf6d9a477ed0685db"}

Advised to go to this place after neck surgery. From the start the nurse that called us back, Lauren, was incredibly rude and unprofessional. She was the rudest person I have ever met in the medical field. Ordered to give urine sample, so I politely asked to see the dr first. So she said \"if you don't have anything to hide I should WANT to give a sample\". After her belittling us for the next 15 minutes we saw Goyne. No help what so ever. These Drs are strictly pill pushers in my opinion, not helping to find the cause of problem, just prescribing narcotics and off to the next room. I don't know if all pain clinics are like this, but I would stay away from this one. Overall lacking in cleanliness and patient care is non existent. Strictly a place to get prescription pain pills is primarily what they are used for. Not much of \"practicing medicine\". Oh and if you have a question for Goyne, forget it. She has no time. She's off to the next room to deal more prescriptions. Try another place. Any other place!\n\nI see where the response of my post from the clinic is for me to call them because customer satisfaction is a high priority. I don't think the office realizes I called twice to speak to Dr Goyne. Left my number.

They are truly two of the most knowledgeable medical professionals in the chronic pain field. Patient questions and concerns are thoroughly listened to and addressed at each visit. An insurance change caused me to have to leave a different reputable pain mgmt practice, and seek out a new Dr. Being extremely pleased at the other clinic, I searched for somewhere that I hoped would at least be close to as good(I decided that \"tolerable\" would work for the time being). I found Southside PS and gave it a shot. I liked Dr. Kendrick, but felt like some of the staff members back then (SEVERAL years back)viewed me as another drug seeker. I held on, tried to understand what they dealt with on a daily basis and decided to give it some time. One of the best decisions I've ever made!! It wasn't too long before I started noticing that those particular staff members weren't there and they were replaced with helpful and caring individuals who treated patients the way that we all would like to be treated. Dr. Kendrick is awesome, but his CRNP's make it to where he can do what he's actually there to do, and they handle the rest. Rickey and Stephanie have both gone above and beyond to help me with any issues that I may have, as well as ensuring that I do what I'm supposed to be doing in order to get the maximum benefit from my treatment. I came to them on certain medications that I had been taking for a while. I knew that upping the dose could be dangerous as well produce more issues down the road, given my relatively young age. I explained the issues that I was having to Rickey, and with my answer to a single question, he was able to remedy the situation... Without changing med, dose amount, or frequency! It was an extremely simple solution; however, not being a medical professional myself, it was not anything that I would have ever figured out/thought of on my own. The pharmacology associated with how the body distributes and metabolizes certain meds, is foreign to me. I am ever so thankful to Dr. Kendrick and his staff for helping me be the wife/mother/employee that I am today! With only 1-2 minor exceptions(and it's not every appt), I feel cared for and respected from the moment I sign in, until I walk out the door to leave.\nAs others have mentioned, it is difficult to reach them via phone. They have a solution for that too, that's extremely easy and convenient - Patient Portal. Just create your account, and you're set. I use it as my primary means of communication with the office. You pick your doctor's name, type of issue/question you have, and then start typing out the explanation or ask your question. There may have been 1-2 times that it's required a call back to me, but the overwhelming majority of the time, they are able to just \"email\" a response through my portal account. This is not  ideal for TRUE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES, thus the 911 system. A question or request can still be important and/or time sensitive, and not meet criteria for Emergency status, in which case, the only thing to do is send or leave a message and wait for the response.

Dr. Fulmer was assigned to both of us.  We were both unhappy at first.  I didn't want a block but she was adamant I needed to try it.  I did get it\nand it didn't do anything for me. Switched meds several times and went thru misery.  I also felt like Dr. Fulmer didn't have a good \"bedside manner\", but I now realize she was just being cautious and trying to get to know us the same as us getting to know her. She tries to find the best med that will work for you as an individual, instead of just putting you on strong meds.  She is very sweet and willing to answer any questions when we see her. The \"extra\" staff you see before you see the doctor is just to help speed up the process which I am grateful for because you don't sit in the waiting room all day.  We are usually seen very quickly when we go. My only complaint, as I see in other reviews, is also trying to get someone on the phone.  If you have to speak to a nurse you have to leave a message and recording says if call is before 3 p.m. you will get a call back same day.  I have never been called back the same day, usually 2 or 3 days.  I would think the recording needs to be changed or have more staff to answer calls.

I was told the decision would be bases on a psychologist review.  I had my appointment with the psychologist and went over my history, etc\u2026  Psychologist was fine with everything and recommended they continue my medication.  Then things went bad.  I kept getting put off on my medication.  During this time, I had expensive tests done on me.  One was being shocked for 45 minutes to check my nerves (hurt like hell).  Next was putting a needle in my leg and shocking me some more (good lord, what the hay????).  Next, an injection while anesthetized.  I started getting a funny feeling when before every appointment I would get 3 calls to remind me to bring my Co-pay.  Before my injection, I got 5 calls to remind me.  Then I got a call Friday that they would not prescribe my pain medication I need to simply function.  Then it all became clear.  This place did not want to help, they wanted my money.  Multiple calls for co-pays, expensive (and very painful) tests, etc\u2026.  They claimed it was illegal to prescribe me my meds, but this is a LIE.  I actually called the Alabama Medical Board and DEA, it is up to doctor\u2019s discretion.  Wow.

Dr. Meyer, however, did not change the medications I was taking that were working well for me, he simply adjusted the doses and took over the management of them because he is much more experienced in their uses for the control of chronic pain than the physician that was previously handling them had been. He immediately, upon my first visit, ordered new imaging (MRI), which was scheduled and done within a week of my first visit. Then in just one week from my first visit I received an epidural, which helped alleviate much of my constant unwavering pain in my hips and lower back area. He doesn't put you completely to sleep like the places I've been in the past have, where it was an all day event that involved an anesthesiologist. He does them either completely awake or if you're a little apprehensive like I was, offers Versed which helps alleviate much of the nerves and acute pain during the procedure. It was over with quickly and immediately following the procedure I rated my pain 3 points lower on the 0-10 scale, (at a 3 instead of a 6 like when I arrived) and within an hour it even got down to a dull ache instead of the sharper pain I normally experience in my hips. So that is incredible to me! My procedure was yesterday, so I am a little more sore today which is to be expected, but I'm icing it down every hour or so and using over the counter Salonpas Lidocaine patches. Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with Dr. Meyer, in my short time as his patient so far. He is a great bedside manner and his staff is absolutely wonderful!! His assistant in the procedure room was awesome and explained everything to me very thoroughly and answered all of my questions. (And I know I probably had a lot bc I get talkative when I'm nervous. \ud83e\udd23) The front office staff has been invaluable as well with scheduling and any insurance questions! He is very obviously not out to \"make you wait and take your money\" like I read that some silly person reviewed prior to me. I even tried to pay my $50 copay at my injection visit and the staff told me just to wait, because often times the insurance companies didn't charge copays on procedure visits, and they didn't want me to pay it if I didn't have to. Dr. Joshua Meyer and the nurse practitioner Hope Craft, FNP that I met, completely only came off as caring and that they are genuinely out to help you live a better quality of life with as little medication and as much activity as you can fit into it! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc97", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9845aaaaab:0xe341d42033b9ad2a"}

I have driven an hour each way, at least once a month, for years, passing by many other pain physicians, to be a patient here. On my first visit, they found two diagnoses, one chronic syndrome and one likely fatal vascular condition, that had gone undetected by countless physicians for over 40 years. Their treatment of these conditions not only likely saved my life, but also greatly increased my quality of life. They offer chronic and acute treatment by a wide range of skilled specialists that is individually prescribed, adapted over time, and always representative of the most current and effective treatments and procedures. I've never encountered bad bedside manners from any physician or nurse. Even office staff is top notch. They are skilled and caring professionals whose goals are to know their patients, provide quality, individualized healthcare, treat a wide array of specialties, and reduce or eliminate pain for truly suffering patients. And because they provide such top-notch, organized, and quality care, they expect and require patients to be compliant, VERY timely, and willing to do their parts to improve their own lives. They are not a pill mill, so drug seekers need not apply.\n\nThe ONLY critique I have is that the practice and patient load is rapidly growing, so it has sometimes increased usually very short wait times and made it difficult to be flexible with scheduling appointments. But, they constantly ask for and respond to patient input, so they continue to actively modify their practices to improve these issues.

I use Weldons pharmacy and they absolutely will not fill my script until the day the doctor wrote the script for. Never has Weldons fill a script early. So they punish everyone because of what SOME pharmacy are doing. All Alabama pain has to do is have everyone bring there bottle in on there visit.

I have no mediation to take until my visit is done then i have to go and have it fill. Which can take over a hour. So by that time i would go over 13 to 14 hours with no pain medication.

Been complaining of pain getting worse over the past few years, no changes. My dr left, then my replacement dr left. Still complaining of worsening pain so my fill-in, Dr Arrtie Pisaturo decides to REDUCE my pain meds after \"looking at my chart\". What?! I can't imagine what she possibly could've seen in my chart to come to this decision. I have felt for a very long time that I haven't been listened to, so there's no telling what the nurses have entered, especially considering it's very rare to see the same one more than once, and the patient portal is completely useless. All they seem to want to do is give you refills on your current prescriptions and get you out of there as soon as possible (I mean out of the exam room, because you have to go back to the waiting room and wait for an eternity to be given your prescriptions. They have to wait until the drs are between procedures to sign the prescriptions.). And no, I'm definitely not a drug seeker. I don't like being on opioids. I stressed this to my original dr and we discussed trying the Medtronic device when I talked to him before a spinal injection. I was so enthusiastic and told him I'd love to try it. That was the end of it. I didn't get to discuss it with him again because you're \"not allowed\" to see your dr unless it's your first visit as a new patient or when he talks to you right before you're wheeled in for a procedure. And I haven't had any more procedures. I feel like the patients are just paychecks to the drs and nothing more. I know its not just me because I hear conversations between other patients in the waiting room.

They gave me a discounted rate, and began trying to treat me.\nIn short, i torn a ligament, and had to have surgery, so the doctor sent me to a colleague.\nFlash forward years later, and i'm having harsh pains in my lower back, from my work field. I return to this clinic, because of previous great services. My original doc wasn't working anymore, so i was taken in by Dr Kaul himself.\nThis continued for weeks, him helping keep my pain at a good, manageable level. I started to go less and less, as the pain started to simply vanish...Till...\nI got into a car wreck. My neck started to feel awful sore 2 days later, and i got worried.\nI then began looking for an accident lawyer, and through high google reviews, went to Moore's law-firm. I spoke with them, and was asked if i was being treated for the pain. I told them not yet, but i used to go to a local chiropractor, and was gonna go back very, very soon.\nI was asked where i went, and when told, the lawyer started laughing, the doctor, and the lawyer have been college for the longest time, and the lawyer sends hundreds of cases to Dr Kaul....Huh, small world..\nMy lawyer knows my doctor..\nSo to shorten this some, i was treated by Dr Kaul over a couple months, and even looked forward to it; talking to the staff, even becoming friends. The fact i felt so much better after leaving left a great association with the habit of going a couple times a week.\nAfter treatment, my papers were directly presented to Mr Moore, and he helped me with my case in a very straight forward manner.\nSo between these two professionals, and their staffs, i felt very taken care of, and confident that i was more than a $ symbol with legs.\nA++", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d12635cecc5:0x80d5f7984d2315ca"}

In just 2 weeks of treatment, I am moving more freely; sleeping soundly and feeling great!  Unfortunately, my back problem began to surface after a minor exercise routine, 2 years ago.  My husband suggested I find a chiropractor to see if that type of treatment would be helpful.  After checking reviews, calling several chiropractic offices and listening for a voice with a caring, understanding attitude, along with their ability to answer my questions, I found Mobile Chiropractic Associates.  Tonya, medical secretary/receptionist, took time to speak with me and answer my questions in a kind, courteous and unhurried manner.  I have received great care!  Dr. Douglas Kaul is very knowledgeable, is down to earth and doesn't pull punches. He shows and explains all he finds on the x-rays, which he takes himself.  He makes you feel comfortable; listens to your concerns regarding your treatment options and plan, answering any questions you may have.  Diane, his nurse, is very nice and engages you; always finding something to say to make you smile. As evidenced by the x-rays, my neck and lower back were slightly out of line and in that very first visit, I had an adjustment.  I didn't know what to expect during the process and Dr. Kaul explained everything and was gentle.  That day was the best I had ever felt in a long time and I am feeling even better, today! Dr. Kaul, his associates and staff have great compassion for every person who comes for help.   After your first visit, you will realize the care you receive is focused on getting you up and moving again, as pain free as possible.  Before you decide to give up; suffer through the pain; limit your activities and just take pain pills, epidurals or opt for surgery, find a well-qualified, caring, chiropractic physician.  I would like to suggest one such physician to you: Dr. Douglas Kaul at Mobile Chiropractic Associates.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d12635cecc5:0x80d5f7984d2315ca"}

Front office staff was good. Dr. Thacker was great! Very thorough examination, felt confident with what he had to tell me. Was onboard with his plan, thought everything was going great. Then came the simple task of printing out prescriptions and leaving. The first set of prescriptions were incorrect, I thought ok life happens. Went back in let the receptionist know that the prescription was possibly printed out wrong. Nurse brought the Dr. out to \"explain\" the prescription to me. He \"explained\", left the reception area (really was a fan of having anything \"explained\" to me in the reception area especially by the Dr.) Nurse was then very adamant that the system is not wrong. I insisted, she resisted, but finally went back to check. I thought no harm, no foul, 10 minutes later the nurse comes out and hands me the \"corrected\" prescriptions. I said that I was sorry (wait what am I even sorry for) she said \"that's ok\". Make it to the elevator only to have them wrong AGAIN. I go back in let the receptionist know that maybe they printed out wrong again. The nurse comes out smirks, takes them back. A little quicker this time she comes out hands to me, \"corrected\" again. I get to the elevator and thinking noway they are wrong again, lo and behold, AGAIN. This by now had lost its \"no harm, no foul\" charm. I go back in she takes them back. I think of a possible issue with the prescriptions that the pharmacy may have. So, while she is about to make a copy of the prescriptions and has the Dr. sign it. I interuptered her and tried to mention the possible issue, only to be interrupted by what I gather is the nurse practioner to be told \"that is what the system says, so it is what it is\" tried couple more times to explain my concern to the point I was like just forget it. So, I am assuming that is the extent of my patient-Dr. relationship there, sadly. But, this is for anyone that may read this from this office. I suffer from severe depression and severe anxiety and no, not related to the pain (pain certainly doesn't help). I know you probably do not care but my world is practically falling apart. Now, pain has cost me my job and yea that stings for anyone but with the issues I suffer from I realize I am not capable of seeing the forest for the trees and decent coping skills. I was more than polite to everyone involved until my last encounter of being interrupted. But please remember people are not in your office because they want to be and for the love of God please understand that people have to deal with life's kicks outside of those walls of your office. Please just take the time to be kind with in reason. Thanks", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ca9f0272bcd:0xd3dad948c181a60a"}

The first day I walked in, he said he'd have me in \"Olympic shape\" in no time without even seeing what was wrong. I was paying him $100 a week to do therapies that ultimately didn't last more than a day for chronic back pain that I've been suffering for more than 7 years. Every week, he'd tell me something different that I'd need to do and would get aggravated at me because I couldn't afford to keep trying therapies that weren't working. But the kicker came when I finally started feeling a bit better by doing various exercises that helped me tolerate my constant pain better and I had an appointment where I was going to tell him I'd just delay the epidural shot we were planning. The night before, however, one of my boys started throwing up and had thrown up 5 times over the night and I had no choice but to cancel my appointment. I told them there was really no need for me to reschedule at the moment, that I was doing somewhat better and wanted to see how my body handled the new exercise. They said they'd have to charge me a $25 fee for an \"unacceptable cancelation\". Are you kidding me? How am I supposed to be able to control when my kids get sick? I'd been considering switching doctors to begin with because I didn't feel like he was meeting my needs, but that sealed it. So what about the almost 2 hours that I sat in the waiting room on my first visit past my appointment time? What about the time I've lost waiting for late appointments?

I moved from PA to AL in 2010 and had nothing but horrible experienced with the doctors down here. Seems all I was finding were ones that just wanted more money for less time and constantly being misdiagnosed. So badly I had to have an emergency Splenectomy because of a tumor that had grown in my spleen overtaking it. The kicker is Huntsville Hospital found it in 2010 and never told me. Needless to say I almost died.   That terrified me. I  didn't even want to seek medical care because of what I had already experienced. This left me in an enormous amount of pain. I found HPM in April 14' and read up on Doc and got a referral. Doc saved my life. He listened to me, evaluated me and not o lay gave me medication but did needle treatment. I went home crying. It was the first time I could touch my feet in years. My muscle was that bad around my L5 area. Within 6 months I was off disability and working at NASA. Finally able to lead a normal life. He cares. He doesn't force anything you don't want. He knew at one point I didn't have insurance so he didn't push extra things on me that cost money. He cared more about if I was ok. He's met my girls and my husband and I introduce him as the man who saved me. Yeah maybe there have been some iffy staff over the years but let me go on and tell ya they get in everywhere. Doc and his staff has done an amazing job at weeding them outa d keeping the ones that do a great job. He doesn't even like to Hear that someone was treated unfairly. He will fix it.

He has made such a difference in my life!  I can function day to day with my kids and do the things I need to do to be mom and a productive citizen!  Most pain clinics in our area have stopped any daily medications after the fall of Dr. Aggarwal, and unfortunately this affects the lives of many people.  Before I came to Dr Thacker, my pain management doctor was doing procedure after procedure and collecting that insurance money and my surgical copay month after month.  I could not get out of bed in the mornings.  I came to Dr Thacker and he not only got me on a daily pain medication regiment, but he also a total body workup and found vitamin and mineral levels along with hormones out of whack and gave me suggestions on what supplements to add and how much, and I have never felt this well before!  I wake up every morning close to pain free (compared to where I was before he came into my life) and energized!  He is open to alternative therapies like dry needling (like acupuncture) and other less conventional treatments like chiropractic and massage.  I love all of the nurses, they're all so sweet.  There's one young lady at the window, Wendy, Lindy, Lindsey, or Penny, (I can never catch her name but it sounds like one of those) she wears glasses and has long hair that has some curl to it.  She is so precious.  The other girl at the window has never mentioned her name, but she's skinny and her hair has been up the times I've seen her.  I don't care for her.  She's very cold and unwelcoming, and she only does the bare minimum to get buy.  Don't expect her to go out of her way for you on anything.  She's also on her personal phone every time I sign in.  The lady that did  my drug test at my first appointment, Shari was her name, is also rude.  I've been in an exam room and overheard her and skinny receptionist gossiping about a patient talking about they don't think he had a legitimate pain and he just comes through for medication.  The truthfulness of that doesn't matter, but that is between the doctor and the patient, not a sub par receptionist and a lady who plays with urine all day.  It's a shame I have to rate Dr T so low because of these two nitwhits, but they're the face of his practice.

Both were done by the same surgeon. My first surgery was in November of 2015. I did physical therapy at another Hoover clinic (not a therapy south) and I grew to hate physical therapy, physical therapists, anything associated with them. I honestly believed the profession was a crock because of the poor care I had received at that clinic. I didn\u2019t know any better! My hip never got better, it was much weaker than before, and three years later, is still in pain and lacking the function I had prior. My skepticism towards physical therapy as it turns out, was just because I went to the wrong place. After a shoulder surgery in May of 2016, I was referred to Chris and Corey from a friend and my outlook could not be more different now. Not only did they cater my shoulder rehab to my specific sport (weightlifting), they also helped me repair my hip and alleviate some of my pain. I\u2019m a true believer in physical therapy now, even going as far as changing my career path so I can also change someone\u2019s outlook. Chris and Corey go above and beyond for you and Lauren is always a friendly face when I come into the office. I can\u2019t say enough good things.
