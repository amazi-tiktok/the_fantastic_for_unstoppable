My experience with Byram Healthcare has been very frustrating. I have not been able to depend on them to send my Dexcom g6 supplies consistently. I am a type 1 Diabetic with significant & frequent hypoglycemic episodes. I depend on my Dexcom g6 to keep my blood sugar stable. When Dexcom could no longer provide supplies for Medicare patients, I changed to Byram Healthcare on 8/2020. They have been late shipping my supplies several times resulting in me being without sensors for days & sometimes weeks. When I call to follow up on an order, I am told my doctor is late sending chart notes/Rx or Medicare has not paid. I requested Byram to give me a heads up when my order is delayed so I can intervene as appropriate. My last straw was with the last order that was confirmed by Byrham was 5/26/2021.  As of today, June 28/2021, the order status still says \u201corder in progress\u201d. So, over the last several weeks when I called Byram to find out why my order is delayed, depending on who I talked to, I got the following reasons:\n\u2022\tNo chart notes (I called my doctor\u2019s offices & they indicated they sent the requested documents)\n\u2022\tByram admitted they got chart notes, but it was signed by the AARP not the doctor (I alternate between the physician & the AARP). Byram said they would clear up the confusion & call me back by COB. Never got a call back.\n\u2022\tNext time I called they told me they were under Medicare audit & someone would call me back. They never called me back.\n\u2022\tNext person at Byram I spoke to said Medicare has not paid since 2/2021. I called Medicare & they informed me that Byram has not filed a claim since 2/2021. I called Byram & told them Medicare does not have any open claims & my online Byram billing account says that my balance is $0.00. Byram said they would investigate & call me back. As of today, not 1 call back. I am done!\nI have been using Dexcom glucose monitoring supplies since 3/2019. When I was receiving my supplies from Dexcom, I never had any issues.

While this is all in a days work for the staff it was a life changing, life altering event for us that day. We were trying to wrap our minds around the fact that he needs the oxygen when we were told that his insurance would not pay for a b-pap machine or supplies, nor would it pay for his oxygen (it would pay at some level for oxygen but not at the level he is at currently, however, he still has to have it.)  Later he was, thankfully, able to get a donated b-pap machine (cost is over $1,000) but had to purchase the mask. The mask was over $200. When we purchased the mask, the staff person was not friendly, she sold us a mask that was too small and did not try to fit it on him. We did not know how to use the machine and we had trouble using the mask.  We took the mask back and asked for help. They exchanged it for another size mask and sent us on our way. Today we went back because he was still having trouble with the mask fitting correctly and were told their policy was 30 days for return and also that we could only return one and would have to purchase another one. We did not have over $200 to buy another mask. We were upset that policy was not explained to us at the beginning and we were upset because they said they could not find a record of the exchange but wouldn't exchange this one because we could only exchange once and we had already done that (but they still had no record of it).  The staff was not caring, not compassionate at all, and actually rude. When we said something about it we were told we should have  complained the first day if we were unhappy.

I have had no experience with any other department of this company.  With that being said the CPAP department is concerned only with a dime and customer service is a myth.  Stay away.  After dealing with them numerous times over the last year, the only thing that has been extremely clear is Jason believes and makes it known to his customers that their insurance never pays enough for his services.  Somehow you end up leaving feeling like this is your (the customer\u2019s) fault and you should be proud to be in his mere presence, since you haven\u2019t paid for it.  This is brought up every time you conduct business with him. If you don\u2019t want to accept certain insurances, then don\u2019t.  However, no one needs to hear your continuous unprofessional whining.  All of this can be tolerated until I am denied a report being emailed to me that is required for my job and my families livelihood, without paying them first for a report they already agreed to provide....for a report, my report that Jason told me I could call and get with no issues when I received my machine.  This issue has since been elevated through my insurance company and was informed this is not allowed.  In my experience, customer service doesn\u2019t call Deep South Home Medical Equipment home.
