I can\u2019t be sure exactly what makes me love Gorgas so much, but I always check it\u2019s hours before I commit to having a Study day, because it\u2019s where I can easily focus, get/stay comfortable, and remain for HOURS.\nThe staff is great, both librarians and Java City employees, (despite what some people may say in the Java City reviews) and it\u2019s got a space for everyone regardless of noise or atmosphere preferences.\nI always study in the 1st floor Mac room. It\u2019s a \u201cloud\u201d level, meaning groups meet up and are allowed to talk at full volume. Some people don\u2019t like this, but being able to have my headphones in and not worry about complete silence around me is strangely comforting. Also, I can answer my phone while studying without worrying about bothering anyone too much.\nMy only complaint is that I wish Gorgas had hours similar to Rodgers. They are already open fairly late, (usually ~ 7am - 2am) but I am always so happy during dead/finals week when they are open 24/7.\nDefinitely check out Gorgas library if you haven\u2019t already, you will not be disappointed!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602989e571ffb:0x9b42cae362d60c1c"}

There are many computers for student use and areas to study on 1st and second floors of the building. The private study rooms are great when you need less distraction but the position of the rooms make them the hottest areas during the summer and into the fall. The bottom floor is a great area for historians looking to dig into the area's history. Cullman County's law library is also located at this library. The building is rather a little old but is still kept clean and organized. I've done a lot of research at this library over the past 20 years. I'm grateful for the resources and a place to study in silence.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889b65365ef5d1b:0x4ce72864c4230a82"}
