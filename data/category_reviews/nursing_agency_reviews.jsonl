She was bed ridden for a couple of months due to the pain, and after the fracture healed remained bed ridden and on oxygen due to progressing congestive heart failure.  This lasted almost 6 months until she passed, with the last 4 months under in-home hospice care.  My mom lived with me, since she (and the rest of the family) did not want her last days to be in a nursing home.  I am a single man and with the constant care my mom required, I could not handle it on my own, I needed caregiving help.  I contracted out 60 hours every week for caregiving and I took the other 128 hours myself.\n\nI contracted with BrightStar based on recommendations from friends, and I was not disappointed.   BrightStar provided qualified care givers, and if mom and/or did not relate well with a particular care giver, BrightStar would provide a different one.  We eventually evolved to a core set of 2 regular care givers, loved by my mom and I,  covering all 60 hours per week.  I don\u2019t know if other companies would be this flexible and supportive.  If a regular caregiver could not come, BrightStar would notify me and fill the gap, so that I could always count on a caregiver at my home at the planned schedule.  Knowing that a caregiver will be there, rain or shine, is a major consideration when determining if you want to hire a known private individual or a company with lots of caregivers.  Additionally, BrightStar schedulers, nurse, business office personnel were always a pleasure to work with and very supportive of mom and I during these trying time.  BrightStar may not be the cheapest, but you can count on them, so you just set your hours to what you can afford.  I highly recommend BrightStar, and if the need for caregiving arises for me in the future, I will be calling them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862691000000001:0x6ce406a91cbe1e64"}

George (the owner) was so personable and spent a lot of time with us explaining his philosophy on running the most honest, best caregiving experience.

The best are more than caregivers; they are friends, both with my mom and my wife and myself. A rare few were bad enough I ordered them to leave and not return. The owners and managers are careful with who they hire, and pass on our instructions for what is expected from the caregivers, but they cannot monitor everything happening in your home.  In the end, it is up to you to determine which caregivers meets your needs and which have to go.\n\nThat said, anytime there has been problem with a caregiver\u2014no matter the time, day or night\u2014the owners/managers have acted *immediately* to correct the problem, including personally caring for my mom until a replacement caregiver was found.
