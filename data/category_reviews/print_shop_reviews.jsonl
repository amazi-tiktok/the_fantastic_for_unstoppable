There were others in the store that were witness to your extremely rude, and bullying behavior Saturday afternoon. I'm so sorry that we couldn't help you, and that you were not happy here. We really try hard to make every customers experience here a very good one. As I explained to you when you were here - your postal labels would not scan. I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan. Again, I'm sorry that you are not happy, but please don't make a racial issue out of a situation that race simply had no bearing. That is extremely sad. I do hope you find happiness wherever you find to drop off in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x886211946d170b1f:0x88ce374972b76f07"}

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

Today, I missed my mail pick up and our local post office had already closed so we drove down to this store so that we could ensure our packages would go out today.  My 12 year old went in first and was refused service.  So, I then took the packages and went inside only to be told that, \"I don't receive anything from the Post Office for compensation and am not required to provide service to you.\"   I asked for her to put that in writing, she refused, spewed some other nastiness until 2 other individuals came in and I told her I would be reporting her to the proper authorities and I left.   As I type this, I am still shaken, that this kind of bigotry and hatred can still exist.  That people feel they have the right to treat others with such vile.

We really try hard to make every customers experience here a very good one. As I explained to you when you were here - your postal labels would not scan. I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

Our records indicate that you\u2019ve shipped two packages with us in as many years. One internationally, yes - we must ask questions about your shipment. \u201cWhat are you sending? What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I own a small business that I run out of my home in McMullen Cove (and yes, I do have a license with the City of Huntsville).  I mail packages on a daily basis.  Today, I missed my mail pick up and our local post office had already closed so we drove down to this store so that we could ensure our packages would go out today.  My 12 year old went in first and was refused service.  So, I then took the packages and went inside only to be told that, \"I don't receive anything from the Post Office for compensation and am not required to provide service to you.\"   I asked for her to put that in writing, she refused, spewed some other nastiness until 2 other individuals came in and I told her I would be reporting her to the proper authorities and I left.   As I type this, I am still shaken, that this kind of bigotry and hatred can still exist.  That people feel they have the right to treat others with such vile.  I will not be returning to this location ever and would strongly urge others to also find somewhere else to spend your hard earned money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533411883334, "text": "Wow, I feel I have to respond to this - this goes beyond misleading and is simply a lie. There were others in the store that were witness to your extremely rude, and bullying behavior Saturday afternoon. I'm so sorry that we couldn't help you, and that you were not happy here. We really try hard to make every customers experience here a very good one. As I explained to you when you were here - your postal labels would not scan. I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan. Again, I'm sorry that you are not happy, but please don't make a racial issue out of a situation that race simply had no bearing. That is extremely sad. I do hope you find happiness wherever you find to drop off in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x886211946d170b1f:0x88ce374972b76f07"}

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

Surprised, I asked why and was told it was because I used their location as a shipping address.  I was also informed by the clerk the location was not an \u201cactual\u201d UPS location, so there were extra fees that may be incurred. I said I understood, and asked they show me any literature that indicated there was a charge for using the location for my shipping.  They could not produce any literature, documentation, or point out anywhere on their website that this particular service would incur a fee.  However, the clerk did advise if I had simply called the store ahead of time to ask about shipping, they would\u2019ve informed me about the charge.\n\nIn this day and age, who calls for quick info unless it\u2019s a last resort? And why aren\u2019t these charges posted on UPS corporate site or on the local store\u2019s site?  Where\u2019s the transparency?\n\nI tried to give them the benefit of the doubt - I stepped out of line so they could assist other customers and I searched online on my phone for any indication of a charge for this service and found none.  So, really folks, this store - based on their logic - could hold your package ransom for whatever amount they want: $5, $15, $20?  The charge is not posted anywhere, they have your shipment, and won\u2019t release it until you pay.\n\nAfter a fun back-and-forth between me and the manager (?), she finally, out of the \u201cgoodness of her heart\u201d (she essentially spat those words out at me), allowed me to take my shipment without charging me.  She also made certain she made some serious notes near my pick-up signature for her future reference.  Finally, as I was leaving, she made one of those passive-aggressive comments to her colleague, but loud enough to be certain I heard it, something to the extent of: \u201call of this over $5?!\u201d  I responded, \u201cYes. Over $5.\u201d  There have been many times when $5 made or broke my week.\n\nI completely understand and support a business\u2019s right to charge whatever they want for whatever products or services. However, we should not be ransomed into paying some arbitrary, unpublished, hidden charge that we are surprised with at the counter before we can pick up a package. This is the digital age - there is no reason that charge can\u2019t be easily - and prominently - be listed on their website.  Or even printed on one of their many signs behind the counter, or even on a menu of costs/services that they can hand the customer.  Where is the transparency??  But there was nothing other than the word of the clerk.  In this day and age, and in a business that aligns itself with such a large delivery corporation, that lack of information is egregious, especially due to how easy of a fix it is - just update the damned website.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f0c76816d65:0xbc02540c826f8b7c"}

With that service, processing can sometimes take 2-3 days.

I paid them a deposit of $250. As of today, the work has not been delivered. It was promised 10 days after payment. As of today, they are 100 days past due. I posted an honest review on their Facebook page, starting off by saying I hoped I could change it to a positive review in the near future. They changed their Facebook template to not allow reviews so mine could no longer be seen. They always say they are working on my plan and they will have something in a few days. Then I don't hear from them and nothing is ever delivered. Their Facebook page has photos they post- and therefore imply that the work depicted is their own. Through reverse photo look up I found photos they had \"lifted\" from other sites and I contacted the owners. Indeed they did not have permission to use the photos and it was not their work. When I tagged the owners in the misused photos they were promptly deleted from the Elaine Roberts drafters Facebook page. One of the owners of the business from which they had plagiarized the photos of others' work, did know Jimmy Parker - one of the owners of Elaine Roberts Drafters. He told me specifics of how the owner (Jimmy) of Elaine Roberts Drafters worked for him previously and had stolen from him, and described him as one of the biggest con-men he has encountered. Perhaps occasionally they deliver a product enough to keep up an image, I don't know, but after my own experience and what I heard from Jimmy Parker's previous employer, I sure wouldn't trust him with my money again!\n\nAlso look at their other reviews. Jimmy and Christy Parker are the husband/wife team that \u201cown/operate\u2019 this business they call Elaine Roberts Drafting and Design. (These are their respective middle names.)  Previously they operated under the name \u201cCreekside Designs.\u201d I guess they had to give up on that name after they accumulated so many bad reviews. You can google it. Anyway, three of the other reviews for this business are from the owners themselves (Christy Parker, Jimmy Parker, and their old business named Creekside Designs. A fourth is from a family member - Sheila Parker. So half of the reviews contributing to their \u201c4.1\u201d rating are ones THEY CREATED RATING THEMSELVES!

I was shipping to packages off today, one to my mortgage company and another to At&t.

It was still down so she directed me to the UPS store about 1.2 miles away and I went to go get in the car to call ATT before going to UPS to see if this was a outage all over it just Fedex Kinkos. The ATT representative told me they didn\u2019t have a issue so I go back in the store to see if their system was back up. A older lady that I helped in the store before leaving stopped me and said the Caucasian guy behind me earlier had a package he was shipping back to At&t as well. The representative told him that the system was down but she would hold it for him and ship it when the system came back up. I asked the representative when I walked back in the store was the system back up, she replied no it\u2019s still down. I asked could she hold my package and ship it when it come back up, she replied they aren\u2019t allowed to do this.\n\nI replied but you just did it for the Caucasian man who was sending a package to At&t to. She looked shocked!  She replied she isn\u2019t suppose to do that but my problem is you did do it & he was behind me. You sent me to UPS but you didn\u2019t send him!

As happens with large corporations too often, she was PROMOTED to driver.  I couldn't believe a promotion instead of demotion was her reward for running customers off.  However, since she is no longer in the store, if they accept my perfectly good boxes, I will use this branch again.  if not, I will continue to ship through my employer.\n\nPREVIOUS POST: This used to be my favorite shipper and favorite FED EX location.  I even have my own personal Fed Ex account.  However about a year ago Fed Ex must have brought in a new female day manager or supervisor and she behaves like a shrew.  I was believe her name was Helen.  She misquotes Fed Ex's shipping policy and refuses to use \"banker's\" boxes and other good boxes that are actually more sturdy than she sells at that outlet. She says it is FedEx's policy and I have since found out - it is not FedEx policy, but may be the individual store policy.  But she says it is FedEx policy.  However, she is most loud and belligerent and actually refuses to ship unless in boxes \"like she sells\" and pulls off the shelf \"because Fed Ex will no longer accept those boxes\".  Not true.  She won't accept the boxes.  She claims my boxes are not as sturdy (not true) and it is FED EX's policy not to accept those boxes.  Not true.  I've checked Fed Ex's shipping and packing policies and my boxes are very acceptable...and they are more sturdy than the boxes she is trying to force me to buy.  I will no longer ship there but ship through my work and have the charges deducted form my payroll.  Fed Ex is happy to pick up my boxes at my work without trying to make me buy boxes from Fed Ex.  My work place ships many boxes like my boxes (that's where I get my boxes) without any problem.  Someone needs to retrain or terminate the weekday supervisor or manager at this office.  I have read of many complaints about the personnel at FedEx-Kinko locations since Kinko and Fed Ex combined their locations.  I will not go back to this location with Helen there.  When I can't use my work place for shipping (as when the boxes too heavy for me to take in), I have driven 35 miles round trip to drop off my boxes elsewhere instead of dealing with this unpleasant person...what a shrew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b9130ca25b5:0x5bd40fa6ae8c11d"}

We are ten folks from Birmingham who do graphic design and digital and wide-format printing and offer UPS, USPS, and DHL services as a third-party vendor.\n\nYour complaint against the United Parcel Service, Inc is an understandable one, but rating our location 1* won't accomplish any change. We aren't the logistics company based out of Atlanta, and this location isn't owned by them either. Your review is understandably but incorrectly levied at us, and that hurts our business, despite that fact that we don't operate UPS trucks, nor do we maintain UPS drop boxes.\n\nWe know the name \"The UPS Store\" makes us sound like a corporate entity, but we're not, or else we couldn't say that the name \"The UPS Store\" was a stupid choice for loosely-affiliated franchises.\n\nWe would kindly ask that you remove your rating if you are not one of our customers, or that you correct your rating to reflect our service correctly if you have commissioned work from us before.

The person I was dealing with was so horrible and incompetent that after 5-6 phone calls over 3 days(and zero of 4 emails responded to, emails with all the pertinent information for items to be picked up, packed and shipped) I asked to speak to a manager, well Bradley WAS the manager.  Great.  I asked if he had a supervisor or the owner and he dismissively told me HE was in charge - this is where the attitude ramped up, before it was somewhat subtle.\n\nHe would not respond to any email asking for quotes or telling me when they would pick up the items (the pickup service they offer).  It was like he didn't want to have record of the quotes or times in email.  He would respond to direct questions in email with \"would you please just call me, how hard is that\" - as if my schedule revolved around him.\n\nAfter 3 weeks of trying to get them to pick up the auction lot, I made arrangements with another UPS store that would pick up the same day.  I called to cancel at the previous store, told Kody (who told Bradley while I was on the phone) and someone else as well and I also emailed the cancellation.  3-4 hours later they used the paperwork from the first email to pick up the items and I was informed by the other UPS store that the items were already picked up (the seller wasn't supposed to release it to them either but that isn't as much their fault)\n\nWhen they packed up the items they used a huge box, about 3x larger than what was actually necessary basically tripling the cost of everything. It was very expensive now.  I knew this wasn't right so I emailed asking for the weight and dimensions of the box he used, and I got a reply of the dimensions and a \"just call us\" response.  This was after I had called 4-5 times that day and they were always too busy to talk.  Now he wanted me to call immediately (6 hours after the my first call) and when I didn't he proceeded to call 6 times in 30 minutes while I was  on the other line (call waiting beeping 40-50 times for each call, he just let it ring harassing me - I couldn't end my call it was important and why I called 6 hours prior and used email).\n\nThis harassment continued 3 more times with about 2-3 calls each time until their closing time (total of about 13-15 calls, ringing non-stop b/c no voicemail turned on).\n\nMy calls the next two days were hung up on, I never knew who answered the phone, but 5 calls were immediately hung up on when they were switched to an employee.\n\nI called the other UPS store I had scheduled and told them what was going on and was going to have them pick up the items to ship.  I was informed of who to ask for at the other store and that they would be helpful.  I called back and got someone I hadn't worked with - Mikee.\n\nThis was a delight. From the very beginning the attitude was like night and day.  Bradley has no business working with customers or in customer service.  Mikee was helpful, promptly returning emails with complete answers and readable sentences, complete quotes, etc.  Included in the emails were the photos of how Bradley wrapped the items and it looked like a 4yr old had done it.\n\nThere were a couple fragile items, noted 3-4 times in previous emails (maybe Bradley can't read, IDK) that were to be wrapped in bubble wrap b/c they were glass.  These were the only things not in bubble wrap.  The large bulky durable plastic items were layered in bubble wrap and I told him they didn't need ANY.  So, Mikee took everything out of Bradley's packaging and re-packaged the items and did an EXCELLENT job.  I would rate that  part 5 stars,  but after 3+ weeks with Bradley, 1 star is too much.\n\nThe final shipping was less than 1/2 what Bradley quoted (and it wasn't $5 vs $10, it was MUCH higher).  The items arrived and everything looks to be in  order.\n\nI just can't understand how this business can make Bradley a manager and deal with customers. I had another problem with  them 1 year ago with bad packaging on a piece of glassware, it looked like a 4yr old wrapped it too.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553624970087, "text": "Thank you so much for your review.

Every single The UPS Store location is an individual franchise operating under The UPS Store, Inc. brand, a brand that is a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Parcel Service. We are not 'affiliates,' we are a child company that is both wholly owned and legally distinct from UPS, Inc. As such, we are required to follow UPS corporate policy as well as The UPS Store Corporate policy. This is not unique to ours or any other The UPS Store location.\n\nUPS requires all UPS Customer Centers and The UPS Store locations to maintain their own 'Third Party Account' (also known as a UPS Shipping Account) and does not allow for any entity with a Shipping Account to ship using another entity's account number.\n\nWe, as The UPS Store Southside, would love to be able to accept these account numbers for payment, but we are explicitly forbidden from doing so. We do, however, apologize for the inconvenience this caused you. As you'll recall, when you came in on Friday, November 3rd at around 2pm, our associate did attempt to explain this to you. While we understand better than most just how confusing and frustrating some UPS regulations and policies can be, especially from the outside-looking-in, we feel that describing our staff as discourteous is, at the very least, misleading.\n\nWe hope this adequately resolves any lingering confusion, and if that's not the case, we invite you to reach out to us for further clarification.\n\nThanks!\n~Management"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc491c8eda7:0x8903c5dbd49cb474"}

I've always been a big fan of online shopping, and before moving to Tuscaloosa I had all my packages delivered by UPS with no problems. Since moving here, every single item I have ordered has come with some problem or other. Every package looks like they were playing football with it behind the store before delivering. I had a high end TV delivered with the screen shattered right out of the box. I actually returned that one, relabelled it, and marked through all old labels with black sharpie--and they delivered it back to my door the next day, drenched in rain. I had to take off work twice to return the same item. Now they won't even deliver to my address--they see I live in a gated apartment, give up, and drop my packages off to be picked up at stores all over Tuscaloosa (CVS, Michaels). So now, every order, I have to spend hours trying to track down where they left my package. The order I picked up today from Michaels was mislabelled, so instead of a tablet I got an Apple TV that I now have to take off work (again) to return.

From the only employee I\u2019ve ever seen there (Jay?) to the actual customer service online. The employee clearly wasn\u2019t trained on how to properly communicate to customers as there are a couple of issues that I would like to point out from that alone. He speaks in a manner that tells me, \u201cGet out of my face, I don\u2019t want to deal with this,\u201d or \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about and you don\u2019t,\u201d which seems to not be the case as I\u2019m reading the everlasting one-star ratings. We walk into the store with no one at the front office and him doing whatever that he does. After the wait, he comes out, talking on the phone. I cannot even begin to explain how and why this was extremely disrespectful and even offending. We were having issues with the transaction of our package, however the way handled this was- to say the least- atrocious. He started muttering under his breath in his language, no doubt something less than appropriate in the workforce, directly to our faces. Not to mention the stench of smoke was absolutely putrid in this building. It\u2019s atrocious. I was thankful I had my mask, but it was still so strong that I couldn\u2019t wait to exit the establishment (from both his attitude and the stench). Speaking of masks, he did not have one throughout the entire time I came in. In a pandemic. Do I need to elaborate any further? In case you thought there couldn\u2019t be any more wrong with this situation, I called customer service and got hung up twice. The third time they tell me I have to make an account on their website in order to have any of my questions answered. That is by far the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard and if they wasn\u2019t enough, when I actually made an account, they acted as if I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think they actually allow customer service calls at all and this is their way of doing so. This is just for this location because I called customer service for every other UPS near me and they picked up right away. I am 110% sure that Jay is the reason I cannot call, as he was using the phone for his own personal enjoyment. I have nothing to say about this entire matter except that I will never be going here again.

You forgot to mention that you walked out to your car, and that is when other customers were helped. You also forgot to mention that the owner was working by himself as his employee was at lunch. A print job that was emailed earlier in the morning was being produced and we have one color machine, so it's impossible to work on 2 print jobs at the same time. So, that order would have been completed first. That's why you were offered to leave your flash drive and come back. We do know that more than one file, 5x5, fits on one page. The owner misspoke because his mind was on the other print job. We produce hundreds of these type of print jobs (invites, note cards, business cards, etc) each year and would be happy to assist you in the future. The best way for us to produce print jobs is when customers email us their files: store0924@theupsstore.com and let us know when they are needed.

I went in yesterday to drop off a package. They were swamped and it was a 45 minute wait. The wait was not the issue. It's December and I expected there to be a wait. The issue was that there was no social distancing encouraged in the small lobby space! There were 13 people crammed in a small area at one point + employees. There was one employee not wearing a mask at all. She kept walking around in the front area and making trips out the front door through the crowds of people. Another had on a 3\" chin visor mask, that let's be honest, wasn't protecting anyone. As someone that is high-risk and being very careful about being around people, this was an incredibly uncomfortable (but unfortunately necessary) trip to the UPS store for me.  The gentleman behind me also expressed how uncomfortable he was with the thought of having to step inside the lobby with so many people. In fact, we both hung back and allowed people to filter out before going inside, only to have many more people cram in behind us just moments after we walked in.\n\nWe've been at this pandemic thing for months. Concern for safety is not new. Why was there no one at this location telling people, \"So sorry guys, only 5 allowed inside at a time so we can keep everyone safe.\"  Not to mention the fact the if I have to wear my mask to enter the building, WHY are employees not required to wear proper masks as well?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608217204865, "text": "I am sorry that you had a bad experience.

During the remainder of the holiday season and as needed we will begin having someone at the door to help our customers to maintain the proper social distancing during our busiest periods.

Staff are friendly and responsive,  but it seems they have no experience or training in using any of their computer software ... even the resident \"graphic artist\". The graphic artist wasn't attentive at all to the clear descriptions I had in my email for what I wanted, and it seems the computer itself may be unable to handle the graphics software requirements.\n\nAfter emailing my images and card descriptions, and feeling very positive about the response I received, I arrived to check on the test prints. They were terrible. The original image had been completely changed - apparently a misunderstanding from the email, but I can't see how someone could interpret it so wildly different. I said nothing about changing my own images.\n\nI had a secondary image I wanted on the back of the card, and for some reason the staff stretched the image out of shape and also completely redid the text in the image for no reason. Let me be clear that the image was a jpg format so, to redo the text, the staff had to take it upon themselves to either cut it out from the image and warp it into its new position, or plaster new text on top of it and resave as a new jpg - not at all a simple, trivial mistake. I mentioned this as I watched the staff work with it at the computer, and it was clear they didn't know what \"aspect ratio\" was, or how to resize anything to maintain the aspect ratio, and they also kept working with the bad version they'd redone, instead of the original one I wanted.\n\nIt seems the only print software they \"know\" how to use is the standard Windows photo printing interface. If you've ever used this yourself, you know it's as simplistic as you can get and not the best software for sizing and placing images exactly where you want them, unless you know what you're doing. The staff did not know what they were doing, even to print the right things on the right sides of the paper. And this was the software they wanted to use to size and place images on paper to create my card. What kind of professional printing service uses the barebones Windows software to print ANYTHING??? This is not creative software! This isn't even appropriate printing software unless you're desperate or want only the most simplistic results. Utterly embarrassing.\n\nAfter several minutes of watching the staff stretch and squeeze my image in one program, fail to print at the right size via Windows print, and then try to open up another program supposedly to edit further (and fail because the computer simply wasn't going to open the program), I decided I could do better at home. I also learned that even though the staff said I could provide the text for the inside of the card and they would pick the font and arrange it for me (as you do when you're a print shop), this is an extra charge of something like $10. I was told that if I wanted to save that extra charge, I needed to format the words and everything myself and save it as an image, so the sum total of their responsibility would be printing images and not messing with text. I was also told that if they had to resize any of the images (like they were trying and failing to do) that was also a charge of $10. What graphic artistry does that entail? Who knows. Resizing images is also par for the course for printing cards, and should be free, along with arranging text. But it's not, so YOU need to do all the leg work by making sure your images are the \"right size\" for printing ahead of time. That's right, your jpg on the computer must be sized at 5 inches ahead of time, by yourself, to print on a 5 inch card. Nevermind that the print shop is in the best position to actually control the physical print size and all you should need to do is send a high quality image.\n\nPaper choices are run-of-the mill and nothing special. Will never print anything here for any reason.\n\nTo be clear, I don't blame the staff; they did their best. I blame the owners. Train your people.

I was on my lunch break and was pressed for time. I waited patiently as the clerk attempted to try to figure out how the address should be input it into her system. It ended up taking about 15 minutes or so for this process. There was really no problem with this, even though it was inconvenient. However, the employee then stated you're probably not going to want to ship this once you know how much the prices to which I responded while how much is it, and she stated give me a couple of minutes and I'll tell you. I found this quite interesting as she obviously knew what the price is going to be. She ended up quoting me over $190 for the shipment!! Again one hundred and ninty dollars!.. Keep in mind that this package was about 6\"x5\"x2\".. A very small package. She then proceeded to tell me that USPS would charge me $95 for the package. I looked at her and asked if she was joking.. No, she was not. I quickly grabbed the package and left the store. I drove over to USPS down the road and went in to have the package shipped. The total cost for priority mail ended up being $32.50. Moral of the story, this place is a huge rip-off with very inflated pricing and should not be used under any circumstances for international delivery. They obviously cannot be trusted and do not know how to correctly price and ship packages. Avoid this location, or any third-party UPS package store for that matter.

She writes, \"What good is the UPS store if I can\u2019t ship postal packages.. just one more inconvenience because people can\u2019t do their jobs right!!!\" This review needs to be directed to the USPS, not the UPS store, she named the wrong entity in her review. She is correct about people not doing their job because that's the very reason the UPS store stopped taking prepaid USPS packages, because the USPS can't do their job. They lose packages, packages are delayed because they can't do their job and the UPS store should not have to take the blame for the USPS inadequate culture. So guess what? They don't have to take any more of the blame because they can't provide an accommodation for a service that is so inept in which they get blamed for. I am in this store just about everyday to get my mail. Regardless of how busy the staff is, I\u2019m always treated with, \u201chello Mr. Mazer.\u201d Zared and her crew are the most dedicated, service oriented people I\u2019ve ever encountered.

We told the employee that we wanted the most economical option - the contents were valuable and needed insurance (china, books, birdhouse, rug, etc.), but speed was not a concern.  We were told 3 day residential was the cheapest option.\n\nOne of the five boxes was completely crushed during shipment and several china pieces were broken despite purchasing nearly $100 of bubble wrap and china specific packaging supplies.  I filed a claim with UPS, provided pictures, etc.  Without inspecting the box, UPS ultimately denied the claim because there was a sweater in the package that I'd sent in the box to free up room for stuff in my luggage.  UPS claimed it was inappropriate packaging material even though it was just part of the contents.  UPS would not discuss the denial with me because UPS deemed the UPS Store as the shipper (not me).\n\nDuring the claims process, I found out that ground service was available and would have been ~$200 less expensive.\n\nI called the UPS store and spoke to the manager.  I started by telling her about the insurance denial.  She said it was not their issue since they didn't package the box.  I agreed, but told her UPS will only speak with them (as the shipper) and that they needed to act on my behalf to help resolve the issue.  I next mentioned that we could have shipped the boxes via ground for less money and that staff misled us.  She became INCREDIBLY RUDE and told me the staff just recommended that service - not that it wasn't the cheapest option.  I pushed back and asked if she was present at the time of the transaction - she said no.  With no knowledge of the interaction, she continued to blindly and aggressively tell me what her staff said and did.  It was clear the conversation was going nowhere.\n\nA manager from a different location called later.  She said they'd file an appeal with UPS on our behalf.  No followup occurred.\n\nI rarely get fired up, but this experience was AWFUL!  The staff misled and overcharged us.  UPS denied a claim without ever inspecting the box.  UPS would not speak to me despite my family boxing, shipping, paying for and receiving the boxes.  The manager was incredibly rude.  They were unhelpful and failed to help resolve the claim with UPS.\n\nThis is a great store if this is the service you're looking for.\n\nTo make it even worse, as I was filing the dispute with UPS (which took hours and multiple calls), I contacted the UPS Store to get copies of our receipt.  They were helpful and said they'd send over the receipts.  Instead of sending our receipt, they accidentally emailed me a copy of another customer's DRIVERS LICENSE and SOCIAL SECURITY CARD.  I guess you can add careless to the list too.....\n\nFIND ANOTHER WAY/LOCATION TO SHIP YOUR UPS PACKAGES!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d6271b3defb:0x3377d583ad8084ed"}
