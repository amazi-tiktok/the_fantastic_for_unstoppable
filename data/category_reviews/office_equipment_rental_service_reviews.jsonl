It is convenient and a money saver, I no longer have to send my files to document storage.  I love it!! Bruce was helpful and trained the part-time person I hired to do the scanning.  I highly recommend using Data Ventures.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c00aafd2bbf:0x7c8b1486407c1b21"}
