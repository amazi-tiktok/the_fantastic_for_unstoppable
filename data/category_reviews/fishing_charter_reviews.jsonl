Morgan, AL and want to have a great experience and get your money\u2019s worth, this is your charter! Our experience was worth this extended review.\n\nPrior to this week, I had been deep sea fishing only once and that was on a \u201cparty boat\u201d of sorts. It was an overall bad experience being on a boat with 30 or more people, lines all tangled up, people getting sea sick, etc.\n\nMy wife and I had a totally opposite experience with Captain Black. As a matter of fact, we booked and fished three separate charters with three separate companies during our week at the beach. While each experience was pleasurable, for the most part (come on \u2013 it\u2019s fishing!), our charter with Reel Attractions was by far THE BEST overall charter experience. The customer service was second to none. From our initial phone call to discuss and schedule the charter, to the phone calls in the days and hours before the charter to discuss weather (Hurricane Nate), Captain Black was prompt, courteous, and patient with all our questions. He was at the dock waiting for us when we arrived (early). The boat was a perfect size with all the necessary amenities. He took time to explain everything to us. We didn\u2019t want for anything. Captain Black was very attentive to our every need, he is very, very personable, he made every effort to make sure we were catching a variety of fish (and we did), he operated safely, and he did a great job cleaning our fish. Captain Black is a consummate professional and my wife and I highly recommend him and Reel Attraction charters.\n\nOn a side note, you don\u2019t have to just take my word for it. Not only was our experience with him a stand out of the three experiences we had this week, but it was later validated when we took our haul to a local restaurant who will cook your catch for you. The restaurant staff was asking us about our experience and complimenting the variety of fish we had. Without us even saying his name, the waitress asked, \u201cwho did you go fishing with, Captain Ronnie Black?\u201d You might have chosen a reputable charter when the locals attribute a successful catch to certain charters!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1508070130020, "text": "Thank you for an awesome review!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a260b09a9133d:0xeaa2bd6d182d9a68"}

The crew was very polite, engaging and a pleasure to be around. They made us feel right at home and truly made the experience unforgettable. I would recommend Yankee Star to anyone and will be sure to use them for any future trips we take. Thank you!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07a3bbb0f45d:0x36266047af258bea"}

He was so knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire trip that I had no qualms putting full confidence in everything he told us. We found Jason to be a very honest, trustworthy and personable individual we cannot wait to fish with again!  I think it's safe to say that he took me on the funnest, most enjoyable fishing trip of my life! His passion for fishing shows and doesn't allow him to do anything but provide his customers with the best experience possible! If you're thinking about booking a trip with him, stop thinking and do it!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2f98e63f643:0xeca6a12312165f5c"}

Captain Rob was friendly when we called to schedule, but we really had very little interaction with him once on the boat. When we arrived at 6:45 am, we spent the first 30 minutes going to fuel the boat. Our primary interaction was with the deckhand. We were a group of 7, including two 13 yr olds, and all but one of us have had very little fishing experience, which I'm sure is the case for many who schedule these trips. Our deck hand seemed annoyed by our inexperience by saying things like, \"That's why I told you to....\" and \"Thats what happens when....\"  We really were doing our best! We were also told to make better use of our bait, as if we were purposely feeding the sneaky trigger fish without catching them. Having paid up front, with an added 25% tip, we would have liked a little more encouragement along the way. That said, we did catch some fish and they did clean them as promised. The boat was clean and we chose to have fun anyway. I see that this company does receive good reviews so maybe our expectations were too high, or this was an off day. I wouldn't rule them out completely, but I will research other companies before I book another charter.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533821614155, "text": "Katherine I read your review and truly appreciate  your sincerety.

My husband spoke to Captain Rob via phone to arrange our deep sea fishing trip and was told it would be $185.00 per person for our family of 4.  We were charged $740.00 total before boarding as expected.  Captain Rob took us out for our 6 hour deep sea fishing and it took about an hour and a half before we stopped to fish.  The fishing spot was decent, we caught a lot of fish but nothing really huge as we have in the past with other charters.  Then we trolled back toward shore and caught a couple more fish.  The trip was fun because we love fishing although I wish we would have fished in more than one spot.  Once the boat docked the Captain went to bed and we were left to deal with the deckhand who I think's name was Clint because we think that is what the Captain called him once, but he never told us his name.  The boat held our family of 4 and one other couple.  Captain Rob fufilled what was promised but we were EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED with the deckhand.  He barely spoke to anyone the entire trip and although he did bait my hooks he left my husband and kids to bait their own.  This would be ok with the boys but after docking he cut up the fish and then we tipped him $80.00 and the other family only wanted to tip him $20.00. I know from researching prior to our trip multiple reviews say 10% - 20% is customary depending on how good the deckhand was.  We heard him curse in front of our son when the lines got tangled and then after  we tipped him he forced us to walk to an ATM and said his tip was $40 per person and needless to say our family and the other couple were both highly upset about this.  The other couple approched us after leaving asking how much he made us pay him.  So he ended up making $240     for this trip which we all felt was Ridiculous.  We told him that the Captain never said anything about a mandatory tip of 15% + 30cent per pound of fish (which I never saw how much the fish weighed) but he said \"Yes he did\" and what could we do with the captain now gone.  If I had it to do over I would have refused b/c we never signed anything obligating us to pay that and since when is a Tip a set forced amount?  It should be EARNED based on how we feel he did and he did not earn the $160.00 tip he got from our family.  Plus our 13year old son was sea sick the whole time and only caught 2 fish and sat out almost the entire trip so he didn't do much for him at all.

Captain Doug Price & Deck mate RC really know the fishing out there. You tell them what you would like to catch & they will put you on it right away. Our family chartered a trip from 6:30-12:30 and we were catching fish all the way out to the spot & back. We caught about 54 fish. We did have to throw some beautiful fish back because they were not in season & because some were not regulation length, but we did end up with 23 fish and about 70 pounds of fish meat when done. We caught Red Snapper, vermilion snapper, trigger fish, king mackerel and huge Amber Jack fish. Unfortunately the red snapper were not in season when we went & had to go right back in. I definitely recommend taking 2 Dramamine the night before & 2 Dramamine half hour before launch because the ones that took Dramamine only got sea sick in the beginning and the ones that didn\u2019t were hugging the floor.

Please remember that unstated expectations tend to lead to frustrating outcomes. Our crew provides an Individualized experience for each of our guests. Some may wish to ha e a more hands on experience using only the minimal assistance from the crew while others are more inclined to be walked through each and every step of the experience. Providing the specifics of your trip expectations upon boarding the boat with with Captain Nick and Dillan can usually make for a more satisfying trip.\n\nAs I state in a previous response from your group, Deep sea fishing is the ultimate fishing experience packed with excitement, challenge, and the need for perseverance. The Gulf of Mexico can offer several species of fish. Unfortunately, there is a federally regulated season and catch limit on many of those. During the red Snapper season, (our current season) there is a catch limit of 2- red snapper per person. I apologize if you were unclear on the species limits upon booking your trip or if you and your crew found it difficult to hook and reel in the fish. We discouraged the deckhand from reeling in fish unless specifically asked to do so in the hopes of providing the most genuine fishing experience the Gulf has to offer to the group. Basically, you didn't pay the money you paid to passivly sit and watch the deckhand reel in your fish but instead to immerse yourself and your group into the deep sea fishing experience by catching and reeling in your own catch. Fruits of your labor!\n\nAgain, feel free to reach out to us personally for further discussion. Prior to finalizing your booking, if you find you are unclear on what to expect the day of your trip we are available as many times as you need to call to clarify details from the weather to sunblock.\n\nI sure hope this information helps.

Imagine my surprise, when we fished with Captain Dan aboard the Explorer. What a difference! The Captain put us on fish, and knew when and where to move to keep the action consistent, and stayed out a bit longer than planned to ensure everyone had a good shot at a catch. The crew, from First mate Jason to Julie, Steve, and Ashton, the entire team was first rate. They were fun, lively, VERY helpful and worked hard to keep lines in the water and made sure everyone was attended to, with bait, and fish removal as well as quickly fixing tangles, and kept everyone fishing.\nBy far the hardest working, and most attentive crew in Party boat fishing.!!

As we walked up the stairway to the upper deck to view the dolphins there were no benches or any permanent seating just the cheap white lawn chairs you buy at Dollar General. This not such a big deal but very in professional looking. Second of All as soon as we sit down in our lawn chair we noticed there were way to many people on the upper deck for the amount of chars provided. This was due to the lower deck witch is enclosed and air conditioned smelling like raw sewege. We not talking about a little stick, it was so bad not one person could stay inside and by the end of the trip the smell was leaking out of the lower deck and was ingulfing us on the stairway outside on the boat.This was my chief complaint just due to the fact I have 3 small children that use the bathroom a lot and I was having to go in and out of this stink a lot!! Also could have seen more dolphins from the beach and we had got a lot more close to the dolphins the day before fishing. It was hour into the trip before we seen a dolphin 200yds away.

Once we stopped the first time the captain decided to move location adding an additional 25mins to our non fishing time.

We fished for 5 to 10 minutes and he decided to go to another spot which we got there around 20min later and fished for maybe 10min & captain came over speaker saying a lady had cut her hand & we had to leave accidents happen & we weren't upset about it but nearly 2hrs later on which half my family got sick due to the speed and crashing waves we were ramming through to get her back. A family of 8 which 6 were fishing had 4 small fish. I went in to go ahead and tip the deckhands since it wasn't their fault and they did a good job. I asked the lady in the office about some money back since we had fished maybe 30min after paying for 6 hours. They told me that captain Randy was on his way back and would give me a call. We never received the call & have called back around 6 times. I talked to him once and he hadn't had time to look into it. This is the middle of the 2nd day and still no call back. We have called a few more times & hes still not available. I think hes just waiting us out until we go back to Arkansas where we came from which I dont appreciate. I can handle a yes or no but just being ignored. I dont appreciate. This was my kids 1st trip and I work hard for my money just to be ignored isn't an option.

My Husband and I took our six year old son on the fishing trip. I was worried that our son would get bored or tired and make the trip not so much fun. But he did amazing. He caught the most fish. Several times he caught two fish at once. I did not want to do more than the six hour trip due to being worried about how our son would do, but he could have easily done the longer trip. Once we started catching fish, he had a blast and his enjoyment was the best. For those that have never been on a fishing trip before (like myself), it does take time to get out to sea. So if you are taking younger kids, make sure to have something for them to do to pass the time. But that is normal for any travel time with younger kids. They don't tend to be very patient.

Once we stopped getting bites our captain moved to another location that only brought more success of the experience. His crew mate Sam was always willing to help out with our lines and make sure we had bait.\nI feel this experience alone would make me book another trip with this company and suggest that you give this charter a booking as well!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1616537559448, "text": "Tyler.\nThank you so much for allowing us to serve your family.

My husband, Nick, and I were treating our parents to a first time deep sea fishing adventure. Captain Troy and deckhand, JT, were friendly, fun, and made us feel like family.\n\nWe originally had the trip planned for yesterday, but due to stormy weather we had to postpone. Captain Troy kept us informed and gave us several options to reschedule. Safety, comfort, and our overall experience was his top priority.\n\nWe were excited to go out the following morning. We were greeted with smiling faces and a clean, well maintained vessel.  It has a comfortable, air conditioned cabin, which was a great retreat from the heat.\n\nWhile trolling, we caught a king mackerel that made for a delicious dinner.  You definitely have to try the heifer dust! Then we went out for some fun catch-and-release due to the season. We caught red snapper and cobia, saw dolphins, a leatherback turtle, and a couple of bull sharks.\n\nDistraction Charters is definitely a family friendly charter. They were great with making sure my parents, whom have slight mobility issues, and experienced a little seasickness, were comfortable, included, and having a wonderful trip. Young or old, everyone will have a great time! We will be booking with them in the future and if you want a personalized family-friendly trip, you should too!\n\nThank you again Captain Troy & JT!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuEz_cQuKNI1Gm7_RrF23c7yJUj-5fjRoTWtTU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPrY9DdqXDs6Tk1G4e53Ee24gkdzNo2Lgil_5q=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPu2GIzguPAhhRcq8A0mMJabPDHlhM6Juwu8Df=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYJnbH_iTgpxHPrMupXwJi99CyFM_GLZrUslB0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR6-3ZoXqQY4nQ7yd8RnB3Qh2iDvoLVkWH3N4Y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1598099110526, "text": "Thank you Suzanne for taking the time to write such incredible feedback about your fishing trip with us.

The logistics of reserving a time slot with the charter was simple (reserve a morning or afternoon just before you depart for your vacation or availability will not exist!). Troy responded immediately to dates and times That were available.\n\nQUALITY PEOPLE.  Troy and Sam went out of their way to learn and communicate with each of my family members by name... both were enthusiastic, patient, positive, and accommodating with our family composed of rookie anglers!\n\nTHE BOAT.  \u201cThe Distraction\u201d fishing boat was perfect for our needs.  We took a 50 minute ride into the Gulf for our offshore fishing.  We enjoyed the large, comfortable cabin where we relaxed out of the sun \u2600\ufe0f and enjoyed our packed lunch.  The boat is very spacious and allowed us to easily have 4 wet lines operating simultaneously once we began fishing.\n\nTHE FISHING.  I\u2019ll say we landed in the neighborhood of 40 fish \ud83d\udc20 at 2 separate fishing holes... most were \u201cTrigger\u201d fish which put up a great fight and you knew when you had a big Trigger fish at the end of your line!  We also landed several beautiful Red Fish and a few \u201cRuby Lips\u201d which were wonderful eating\u2019!  Sam cleaned our catch upon our return; we immediately brought our fish to a nearby restaurant where they fried and grilled our catch for a wonderful and hearty dinner!\n\nTHE SHARK. After we had enough keepers in the cooler to feed our family, Sam asked if we\u2019d be interested in fishing for shark.  \u201cWell, heck yeah!\u201d  He baited a leader which led to a huge hook with some large, live bait and my 13 year old son began fishing shark.  As he was commenting on being able to feel the active nature of his live bait, the live bait when dead still... the line was taken horizontally across the bow of the boat... Sam immediately commented, \u201cbe careful what you wish for!\u201d \ud83d\ude1c... we had a shark on (fair warning \u26a0\ufe0f... this is a fairly unusual occurrence)!  All of a sudden, my 16 year old son had the butt end of his pole anchored into a belt harness as he began battling this massive and ornery Bull Shark!  I took a turn... it felt like I was trying to haul up a live anchor from the bottom of the ocean!  When Captain Troy informed us the shark was at a 45 foot depth, my boy found his second wind and was determined to surface our catch.  After about a 25 minute bout, he did!... a huge (by our standards!) 300 pound shark was brought alongside the boat where we had a brief moment to snap some photos and get some video!\n\nTHE EXPERIENCE. Distraction Fishing provided an entirely positive experience and memory for which my family will never forget!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617822292381, "text": "Mark, I am in awe as to the attention to detail you included in your feedback about your trip with us.

As with every vacation I plan with my family, I always do my homework by reading reviews, researching websites, and etc. I chose Distraction Charters for many different reasons, and WOW am I glad I did! We met Troy in the parking area of the marina, he didn't waste a second getting to know my family and I on a first name basis as we made our way to his boat. Troy is one of those guys who you get to know very quickly, it didn't take long to know that I was dealing with a man of integrity that loves to see families have the most memorable experience possible. As we approached our first area to fish, Corey was on top of his job as deckhand. As the family and I were fishing, Corey would always magically appear when you needed him, he definitely had his job down to an art. We kept rods bent and had the most amazing time! My kids will never forget this trip, especially Drew who caught a massive 73lb Cobia!! We even received a video and some great pictures at the end of our trip!

You, Your wife Shana, boys Dylan, Drew and Jordan were so much fun to fish with.  Watching ya'll wrangle some big fish was a blast.  I was pleased when I found out you have the same conservation ethic as we do.   Watching you experience the fishing trip with your family was amazing.  You were so attentive to your family and I knew you wanted them to maximize their experience.  The most incredible few moments was when Drew, your 17 year old hooked into that huge Cobia and fought it with all his might.

Captain Troy and Corey were friendly, funny and extremely considerate of everyone's needs, concerns and questions. I was also very impressed by the attention to detail on the extremely clean and well-kept boat that offered comfortable amenities both inside the air conditioned cabin and the back portion of the boat. The trip was not only extremely fun and exciting but also educational with an emphasis on conservation. Every aspect, process and procedure was thoroughly explained so not only were we told how to fish, we were also taught how to fish effectively.\nWhat stood out to me the most, however, was the high moral standards of the crew of Distraction Charters, their genuine care for their guests and their passion for preserving and promoting the continued health of fish specifies so we may continue to fish for years to come.\nWe were lucky enough to catch our limit, then at the end of our trip, we also caught two more that turned out to be the largest two fish we'd seen the entire time. While some may have \"turned a blind eye\" in favor of allowing these \"extras\" (who's going to know, right?) - Wrong! Distraction Charters made it clear that they always strive to do the right thing - even, and especially, when no one is looking.\nIf you're looking to just go fishing, you can pick any charter in Orange Beach. But if you and your family are like us and prefer a memorable and educational experience for everyone aboard, go with Distraction Charters!\nCaptain Troy - we can't wait to see you again next time!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7RBTec861A5jgIH_PqEOjLi8oOVY2Xx091YbG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1499776086241, "text": "Crystal.

We were visiting the area for Christmas and wanted to try out deep sea fishing. Never having gone before nor knowing which charter to go with seemed like an obstacle at the time. But, let me assure you, I now know I picked the absolute BEST!  Troy and Sam made our experience beyond incredible!  I loved how the website was upfront and honest about their costs and how they charge their fees. Deciding to go with Distraction Charters, I contacted Troy, who was always fast about getting back to me and helpful about answering all of my questions. The day before our trip he messaged me to let me know the weather was great and we were still able to go (we were booked for an off season trip, as it was for Christmas). The morning of the trip we arrived as planned and were met by two very fun, yet professional gentlemen who ran an insanely clean boat!! Being a paramedic, I was a little worried about the safety aspect of the boat, and after a few short minutes my family and I were comfortable and completely happy we picked Troy and Sam!  Being a kid at heart, I wanted to check out what the Captain\u2019s \u201cjob\u201d is, and went to the top of the boat and learned to drive!  Although I wasn\u2019t very good at it, Troy was very patient and explained everything. When it came time to fish, Sam is the man!  He explains how the poles work, what each fish is and why you can or can\u2019t keep it. He will even take your picture for you. He\u2019s all about safety and making sure no one gets hooked or hurt by a fish. He lets you bait your hook or he will do it for you!  If you get your line snagged, just holler out and Sam comes on over and gets you out of your tangled up mess!!!  When your adventure is over, let the cleaning begin!!!! The outside deck gets scrubbed back down. You can sit outside or inside. I actually got a bit seasick on our trip (I knew this would happen, as I always get motion sickness), so I laid down inside on the bench and took a little nap on the way back to the dock!  Once we docked, Sam cleaned up our fish and bagged them for us and on our way we went. No mess for us to worry about and no hidden fees!  Again, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! So, if you want honest, friendly, and fun with upfront costs and no hidden fees that comes with super clean amenities and is safe then Distraction Charters should definitely be your choice!! I know this was a long review, but I didn\u2019t want to miss anything. I hope this answers anyone\u2019s questions that they might have!

Captain Troy was very welcoming and pleasant.  He showed so much concern and compassion towards my grandfather which was a huge plus for us as this was a trip about us having fun and making lasting memories with him.  He was great with the kids, which was another huge plus, and treated us like part of his own family.  I was nervous about the 6 y/o at first, but seeing Captain Troy with her immediately eased my worries.  Captain Troy is huge in providing the opportunity for families to have fun and catch fish in the process.  You can tell he is a big family man and just loves people.  He talked to us the entire time, joked around, invited the kids to ride up top while going out to the fishing spots, and even took pictures for us so we could just spend time together and reel in our amazing catches.  We were able to relax and be ourselves.  The deckhand, J.T., was amazing at helping us and making sure we had everything we needed.  He helped the kids catch fish and provided an impressive learning experience.   J.T. was always respectful, made sure the boat was clean and safe at all times, answered any questions we had, made sure PawPaw was taken care of, and smiled the entire time!  We had plenty of fish for meals afterwards, but most importantly we were given the time as a family to make memories with a crew who were knowledgeable, knew how to turn a simple fishing trip into an actual learning experience, and knows the importance of family while providing an opportunity to have fun with each other.  Love, love, looooove Distraction Charters and can\u2019t wait to go back with them again!

Troy and his ever-helpful and courteous  deck-hand Corey,  were both awesome!  We went on a six-hour fishing trip and caught fish at every stop.  The last stop, which was the farthest out from shore, produced some very challenging fish.   We caught red snapper, amber-jack, and trigger fish.   While we landed plenty of fish, Capt. Troy made the experience more about our family, and especially about making sure our 5 year-old, first-time deep-sea-fisherman granddaughter had the best experience ever!   I highly recommend Capt. Troy and Distraction Charters for a family-oriented, fun time, deep sea fishing adventure.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07a37bb6e81b:0x15121516e72db758"}

Having fished with many charters from Louisiana to Florida, some good and some not so good, our goal was to see that our children were taken care of, we were in a safe and clean environment and that we had the opportunity to catch some fish.\n\nMy sons and I, along with a friend of mine, his son and a friend of his(2 adults and 4 kids) were fortunate enough to fish with Capt. Troy over the past couple of days.    From the moment we met Capt. Troy (but don't call him Capt....Capt is what he does, Troy is who he is :)) it was if we had known him for years.   He was so incredibly attentive to our children and made us feel comfortable before we ever stepped on the boat.  JT, our deckhand, was also incredibly patient and kind (and VERY knowledgeable about what he does) and his soft spoken mannerism was very calming, even when we had 4-5 fish coming in at once!   In 2 days, we caught well over 100 fish and had 4 boys and 2 men that can't wait to go back with Capt. Troy.  In the 12+ hours we spent with Capt. Troy and JT, we never heard anything but positive encouragement, great coaching and a genuine desire to see that our expectations were met to the best of their ability.  If I could give Distraction Charters 10 stars, it still wouldn't be enough.  I have already recommended him to several friends of mine with children and we can't wait to get back out on the water with Capt Troy and JT.\n\nThank you both for allowing us to make such great memories!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589464841442, "text": "Wow.

He is up and down the boat ladder guiding the boat and taking pictures of some of the day's highlights. To add on to that, we limited out on Red Snapper, caught a King Mackerel, and dabbled with several other species of fish while we were on the water. Lastly, they are very personable men.

I'm not sure where to even begin here! If you want a totally different family experience I highly recommend booking a deep sea fishing trip with Distraction Charters. Captain Troy is by far the best and most respectable charter boat captain in the business!!! My husband and I booked a fishing trip for our first anniversary. I had never been deep sea fishing before that trip and I had the time of my life! I felt like family immediately upon meeting Capt. Troy and his deckhand Stephen. I loved the laid back atmosphere and how hospitable they were to us. I had no experience with trolling or bottom fishing previously and I was able to learn so much and have a blast at the same time! A huge plus for me was the emphasis on safety and making sure that everyone on board was having fun at all times. Catching fish is awesome but I realized that it's not even about that (We caught tons that day plus fought 2 huge bull sharks). Conservation is vital to our future and the future of our children's children. They let you keep the best of what you catch and release the rest. That makes so much sense rather than just keeping everything just for the sake of \"look at all the fish I caught.\"  The whole entire experience with Distraction Charters far exceeded any of my expectations for a day of fishing with my hubby. It doesn't matter if you're an expert or you're a complete newbie like me. Capt. Troy goes above and beyond for his customers in every way possible. The cleanliness of the boat was also impressive to me. I had help with anything that I needed at all times. I'm huge on trust and believe me my trust was earned 1000% by the time spent on safety and the fact that I was on a boat carrying a life raft (not many do). I just can't say enough good things about Distraction Charters. Please try them one time and I promise you won't be disappointed in the least. Good people and they live up to their word!!!

I wanted it to be a surprise, which left the picking of which charter company we used up to me. Swell. I searched endlessly, each company saying the same stuff. Then I happened upon Distraction Charters, whose website alone was vastly different than all the rest. What stuck out to me the most was the phrase \"family friendly.\" Being a mom of three kids, that matters. I never thought that it would mean something though, until I began to plan this trip. And then I imagined captains and deck hands cursing up a storm, drinking til they couldn't stand, and not helping my youngins catch some fish. But Distraction Charters screamed family friendly to me so I took a chance. And boy, I am sure glad I did! Troy (the owner/captain of the boat) and Corey our deckhand, was over the top, helpful and friendly, informative and fun, patient with our inexperience, and wanting to know who we really were. From the moment we stepped on board (actually, well before that through calls and texts) they were very welcoming. My youngest is quite shy until she is comfortable with someone, and by the time we pulled out of the dock, she was already racing up the stairs to hang with Troy and help him pull the ship out of the harbor. That means something to me. The trip out and in was spent in Troy's wheelhouse listening to endless hilarious stories, having the kids pilot the boat, and learning many life lessons. And while fishing, there were not many moments where someone didn't have a fish on the line, with Corey rushing between us to get them off as quickly as possible so we could put our lines back in. To Troy and Corey, it was never truly about catching fish (although they sure as heck made sure we caught our limit) but about having fun as a family. Making sure we were creating memories, and not just putting food on a plate. And that is why, we'll continue to use Distaction Charters, hopefully for years to come. Thank you guys for everything!

We went out at the end of tropical storm Barry in 3-4 foot seas and it was a really fun experience.  We hooked into a Atlantic sharpnose shark right off the bat, caught some nice snapper, a trigger, remora and it was just an all around great day.  Troy was spot on keeping us on par in 3 foot seas which couldn't have been easy and Corey was perfect with the kids.  Our daughter Mia got sea sick but it was only for about two hours but thats to be expected in 3 foot seas.  They were very patient, kind, and upfront which was great.  Corey did an awesome job of re-hooking the poles when we started getting hit by sharks so there wasn't much down time which was perfect.  It was nice hitting the amount of spots we did, Troy was absolutely perfect on that.  Not in a hurry, not slow, it was nice having a short break in between so people didn't tire, absolutely perfect trip on what could have been a sea sick day.  Thanks for the great charter.

As a business owner I can appreciate excellent customer service and catering to the paying customer and the crew of Distraction do just that.  I was on board with my wife, 3 daughters and an adopted daughter (friend of the eldest).  Parents, at no time did we ever worry about inappropriate situations or salty language.  These men were respectful and treated the ladies in a manner befitting southern gentlemen.  Captain Troy is a character and always ready for conversation! He is knowledgeable about fishery habitat and how to put a successful trip together.  There are many \"value added services\" that make the trip memorable.\nCorey, the deckhand, is one of the best deckhands I have had the privilege of witnessing.  He was quick to assist without being over the top of you, and handled all of the minor inconveniences (i.e. Line tangles, break offs, etc) with grace and ease.  He was quick to get the hooks back in the water.  Corey was always busy working on the boat when we weren't dropping hooks.  The boat was immaculately clean.  Finally, the fishing was great.  Captain Troy focuses on quality, and that is what we got.  We went on June 1st, the first day of Red Snapper season.  The bite didn't disappoint.  We caught several fish over 24\" and a whopper that went 35\".  Everyone caught fish, everyone laughed, everyone had a great time.

My two sons, nephew, brother-in-law and his son-in-law decided this was the year. We did some research looking for a charter boat to take us out fishing before deciding on Distraction. I was very pleased with our choice.\n\nWe were warmly met on the dock by Captain Troy, his college age son and a very helpful deck hand. Troy showed us the boat (very spacious and clean) before explaining his safety procedures.\n\nAfter an enjoyable ride out to the reef, with amazing views of the coast, we commenced to fish. Our group consisted of rookie-knowledgable fishermen, so Stephen, the deck hand, showed everyone how the custom fishing gear worked (very nice - well cared for equipment).\n\nMy bait wasn't in the water before one of our party shouted out \"I have one\" which turned out to be a large 12+ pound Red Snapper - one of many.\n\nDuring our trip, Captain Troy took pictures of each one of us holding up our \"trophies\" as well as group photos. While I chatted with him on the way back to the dock, he burned a CD of the pictures as well as a DVD of our entire fishing experience - so great to show those who didn't go on the trip.\n\nI whole-heartedly recommend Distraction to anyone looking for a memorable family fishing trip.

Capt. Troy communicated well in advance of our trip time the status of our charter. He had a cancellation earlier in the day due to 3ft+ swells in the AM (that had since subsided) and asked if we would be willing to move our trip up as there was a break in the weather. He explained he would be able to navigate around most of the inclement weather. When we arrived, we were greeted by his deck hand Corey. He was very courteous and attentive. Capt. Troy came aboard and gave a warm welcome. He's a character, very personable and knowledgeable of the industry. He gave very clear expectations and made known his top priority was our safety and that we enjoy ourselves. Fast-forward a bit, the weather ended up being beautiful and we must have caught 10-15 fish per person. Virtually every fishing spot yielded bountiful fishing! The air conditioned cabin and restroom was very clean, comfortable; plenty of room. Corey was an amazing help. He was ready to help bait hooks, take fish off the hook, help reel in big ones and if a line broke, he made sure there was always a 'fishing ready' pole at all times. When we stopped to fish, the time was maximized with no at-fault downtime of the staff. If a pole wasn't in the water, it was because we needed a break from the abundant and lively fishing.\n\nOverall, this was the best charter experience I've had in my life. When planning a chartered fishing trip and you're sifting through the options, please consider Distraction Charters. They are the \"Original Family Friendly Charter\". They provide a very clean and fun atmosphere; and you will catch fish.\n\nGreat job Capt. Troy & Corey...

From the moment Troy met us until we disembarked (and actually even after because we stopped him for a group picture while we were eating lunch later), we were treated with great respect and sincere care that we have a great fishing trip.  That's exactly what we had!  Troy and Steven (deckhand) were excellent with our kids and very entertaining.  The kids rode up top with Troy and listened to him tell stories and they are still re-telling his stories a week after we've been home.  Steven couldn't have been better at helping us with all of our fishing needs.  He was very gentle and kind with the kids and never got short or aggravated at them.  Another plus was that the boat was very clean and well kept, even the restroom!  My absolute favorite thing was that Troy took great quality pictures of everyone and captured some really awesome moments, while I continued to fish and didn't have to stop and grab my camera every time one of the kids caught something.  I don't mean pictures with a dinky camera\u2026I'm talking really good Nikon camera with a great lens.  We all caught a lot of fish, we couldn't even keep count! My youngest caught a 13lb. red snapper!  On our return ride home, my oldest son (14) rode up top with Troy and slept on the bench beside him.  I loved that Troy even captured that on camera!  He showed me the slideshow of the pics on the trip back and as soon as we docked he had the photos ready to go on a disc for me!  Also he gave us a video of the whole fishing trip!  I had the time of my life on this trip!  We got to see more than a few dolphins right at the back of the boat.  It was awesome!  We will definitely go back with Troy and Steven.

We went on the 4 hour trolling trip the first day and had an absolute blast. We caught numerous king mackerel, and bonito fish. Captain Troy and Deckhand Jacob were professionals at their job, but more importantly they were good to my family. After being on the boat 30 minutes or so they were like family members to us. Captain Troy Knew exactly where to go, and Jacob took care of our every need. The second trip a few days later was the offshore trip, I am sad to say this trip had to be canceled due to weather. The morning of this trip a severe storm rolled into the gulf and created conditions that were at times hazardous. Captain Troy pulled me aside as we were headed out into the Gulf and expressed his concerns about the weather. After looking at the weather radar we decided to cancel the trip, Captain Troy earned my respect because he put my family's safety and happiness ahead of his checkbook. Troy only charged me for the fuel we used and did not require that I tip the deck hand, but I did anyway cause Jacob is awesome. Troy doesn't take deposits so there was no waiting 10 days for a refund or anything like that. I will recommend Distraction Charters to everyone I know and we plan to promote them on our Lifetime Outdoors website. Troy believes in the same things we believe in, and is a good Christian family man. He videos and takes numerous pictures of all the action on your trip, so you can relax and enjoy time with your family. I will definitely come back to Gulf Shores/Orange Beach and take the 6 hour offshore trip next June with Distraction Charters.

A friend and I took our boys--two 8-year olds, one 7-year old, and a 10-year old and Captain Troy and his Deckhand Jacob were fantastic with the kiddos and put us on fish despite relatively poor conditions.  Troy was exceptional with the kids, telling jokes, engaging each one of them, and kept the experience clean/G-rated.  Troy is all about safety and patience.  Also impressive was Troy's commitment to capturing priceless photos--he doubled as a photographer and Captain (and storyteller).  Well into the trip, we started to encounter some fronts at nearly every turn and Troy didn't try to outmaneuver the weather conditions but rather encouraged us to be smart about not taking risks...which we Dads appreciated.  Troy also was extremely fair in adjusting his rate accordingly as the conditions shortened the trip somewhat.  Despite the boys' lines catching on the prop several times over (wind had kicked up and holding the boat over the fish was challenging, leading to some prop line tie-ups), Jacob promptly re-rigged, never showed frustration, and kept a gentleness about him that we all appreciated.  Same goes with Captain Troy.  Troy was focused on photos, putting the boat on the fish, and ensuring everyone was having a good time.  Would use Captain Troy Distraction Charters again.

If you have a family and want to take them deep sea fishing keep reading.  Our 6-pack group consisted of 2 male adults, 1 female adult, a couple of ten year old girls, and a 7 year old girl.  We selected the 6 hour trip and selected Distraction Charter specifically for a family fishing trip.\n\nFirst, the boat.  A very clean, well maintained Hatteras with wood paneled interior and the classic shark jaw mounted on the wall.  The air-conditioned interior was very cozy with plenty of comfortable seating for the family if you elect to get out of the sun and cool off.  Outside there are a couple of benches on the lower deck plus a bench that seats 3 or 4 right next to the Captain.  Captain Troy is very kid friendly and our kids spent a great deal of time hanging out with the Captain including sitting in the Captains seat at the helm (supervised by the Captain of course)!  Captain Troy has tremendous patience with the kids and our youngest tested him thoroughly!!!\n\nAs for the fishing...I've taken my daughter deep sea fishing before and one thing I've learned is my kids could care less about catching that trophy.  My daughter is simply happy pulling in all of the strange looking fish that live in our oceans and could care less about whether we keep them - in fact, she would prefer to release all of them!.  My trip and her trip is going to be best if rods are bent and we are catching fish.  Captain Troy delivered and kept our rods bent the entire trip.\n\nAs an experienced angler, I can say we experienced a particular rare day of fishing reeling in our limits of Red Snapper and throwing back ton's of fish that weren't in season or large enough to keep.  Given the amount of fish we released I'm confident that Captain Troy's style of fishing would have kept our rods bent all day keeper or not.\n\nIf this is the style of fishing you want for yourself or your family then Distraction Charters is highly recommended.  We will likely opt for the longer trip on our next visit now that we know all of our kids have sea legs.\n\nThanks Captain Tony and Mate Corey for a wonderful experience with my family!!!  When we return to Orange Beach/Gulf Shores I won't need to research my options, I'll come straight to Distraction Charters.\n\nPS:  The \"steak\" seasoning you provided was a big hit when I cooked up my first batch of snapper!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07a37bb6e81b:0x15121516e72db758"}

Searching the internet, I am always skeptical of anyone loaded with 5 star ratings.  Well, you will not regret booking with Captain Troy.  Reasons?  1)  You are treated like family, on a family-oriented fun trip.  Troy and first mate Steve went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and having a great time.  2)  When the weather was marginal on our scheduled date, Captain Troy suggested the option of rebooking later in the week.  No charge for taking us out briefly offshore to let us judge for ourselves what the conditions were like.  He just wants you to have a good time fishing, not fighting the weather.  3)  A clean well-maintained boat, with an air conditioned cabin if you get too hot on deck, and clean toilet facilities.  4)  Clean, nice fishing gear, no junk.  5)  You have the boat to yourself, up to a party of six, for the same flat price.  No jousting with another group for fishing space or service.  6)  Pictures of your trip, catching fish, burned to a CD by the time you reach shore.  7)  When we had marginal success starting on the 4 hour trolling trip, we asked about bottom fishing.  Troy headed out further and put us on the fish for the remainder of the time.  Simply put, the fish wore us out.  What an incredible trip.  Although he can\u2019t control the weather or whether the fish bite, you can count on everything else being taken care of in a first class manner.  Very satisfied!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07a37bb6e81b:0x15121516e72db758"}

It was my 60th birthday and I figured it was time to go fishing. I searched diligently for the perfect Captain and did weeks of research.  Being an Emergency physician safety was my #1 requirement. I wanted someone who truly cared and acted professional but was a people person like myself. Troy Frady exceeded my high expectations in every way. This charter boat Captain, Troy Frady and his first mate, Corey, worked non stop to make sure our experience was top of the line and amazingly fun. I haven't had as much fun as I had in a very long time.  This man knows these waters like none other and I, a novice to this sport, caught so many fish including a 34 inch Amberjack which was beautifully cleaned and packaged by Corey. This one we brought home for dinner. He is a wonderful conservationist and shows a great love for the creatures of the deep. I believe without hesitation that the Distraction is the only Deep Sea Charter service to use for any individual but also for families with children who want a fun family friendly experience.  Your children will learn the trade by the best and be treated with respect by someone who truly enjoys serving others - especially families. I am planning on another excursion with friends very soon and will certainly be booking through Distraction Charters. You will feel your money is well spent and the amazing photos that he takes come with the deal...not to mention his delectable  personal seasoning!

The trip started off with a wonderful greeting from Captain Troy and Deckhand Jacob. We soon became like family, it was then Troy and Jacob.  You see these guys don't have to have you call them a title to feel good about themselves. They are who they are and proud of the men they have become. They then proved it by their actions. A storm rolled in and Troy looked at the radar.  He said it was rolling in fast so we were going to hang and troll fish to see if it was gonna pass. No problem because we had our family on this trip. Being safe with my family meant more to him than getting a paycheck.  I appreciate this type of person. So, we trolled and caught some Ladyfish.  It was fun considering a storm was blowing in like crazy. Distraction Charters is THE LEADER of the pack. Many other boats then followed his lead. Everyone in this field look up to him. Just check his credentials. I did before even booking with him. He has excellent reviews going back years. He is great at getting you on the fish every time. He knows this area and knows the fish. He believes in CPR...Catch, Photo and Release. Don't worry YOU don't need to bring a camera. He does it all. He drives the boat, puts you on fish, takes photos and films it all. But he doesn't have hidden costs like others do. He didn't charge anything for the photo cd or movie cd. We got great photos and big smiles. I didn't regret one thing about this trip and you won't either. Choose Distraction Charters, for safe fun family fishing!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07a37bb6e81b:0x15121516e72db758"}

After talking with him and seeing how he does business he encourages people to write truthful reviews on his company.  We booked our trip on a Wednesday for a Saturday departure.  He was booked up but agreed to take us on a Saturday because everything I found on the web suggested I should choose his company.  I would go ahead and plan it in advance because he can be booked up.  We got lucky.  All the other charters had absolutely zero bookings and could take us next day which made me question how good they were.  Anyways my wife, 2 kids, me, and one of my kids friends went on a 6 hour deep sea fishing trip with Troy and his deckhand Kyle.  To say they were great with the kids would be an understatement.  Our boys ages were 10, 12, and 13.  We caught a ton of fish.  Everytime they would slow down for literally 1 minute without a bite we would move just a few minutes away and Troy would have us back on the fish.  We went out in 4 foot swells and we all took non drowsy dramamine before hand and none of us had a problem.  However Troy offered for us to cancel the trip with no penalty the morning we showed up at the docks since the ocean was so rough.  I thought that said a lot about him being worried about the kids.  So we ended up catching roughly 30 Red Snapper, 3 huge King Mackrell, 2 triggerfish, a couple of nasty sucker fish, 2 Bonitas, and 2 Jack Cravells(sp?).  The Jack Cravells were enormous and took my 13yr old son and I over 10 minutes to reel in.  It was quite a battle and we were definitely worn out from it.  They had snacks on board the boat and we of course forgot to pack a lunch so Troy whipped us up some chicken and brocolli for us to eat since he felt bad for us.  I was happy to give the deckhand Kyle 20% gratuity and he cut all the fish up for us and put it in our cooler.  Next time we go back I will definitely use Troy at Distraction Charters again.  Deep sea fishing isn't the cheapest sport but I guarantee that my boys will remember that part of our beach trip for the rest of their lives.  The boat was very nice, very clean, and Kyle was non stop spraying off the decks, baiting hooks for my boys and wife, and we watched him scrub down all the poles with soap and water to prepare for the next group.  I think the boat is about 41 feet and had plenty of room for our group of 5 and 6 wouldn't have been a problem.  Hope this review helps you get more business Troy.  You deserve it!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07a37bb6e81b:0x15121516e72db758"}

They brought fishing stuff for my son when we changed our mind last minute, and got us out on the water quick. Their recommendations of where to catch a fish and where to see dolphins were spot on!\n\nThe boat itself was easy to use and had great technology. Good sound system and excellent depth finder / gps. Boat was in tip top shape and easy to use. While I am very experienced on a boat, a beginner could use this pretty easily.\n\nWe took the four hour trip. The only problem was we should have gotten the full day rental!!!  Next time!  I will definitely rent from them again.\n\nFinal part was the gas up and check for damages. They quickly assessed the boat and saw it was in good shape. Four hours of boat time and just about $20 of gas only, so efficient as well.

From my first phone call to the end of our trip it was like talking to family. Everyone was courteous, informative and friendly. All the crew were experienced. We caught a lot of fish, red snapper which was out of season and we could not keep but also trigger fish, white snapper and vermilion snapper which filled up a bushel basket. The crew was very good at showing us the characteristics of each fish for instance like how to tell a red snapper from a vermillion snapper. I asked Captain Green to cut the trip a little short as three out of the 8 in our group stayed sick the whole time and could not fish. One had never been out on a charter boat. I think we would have caught even more fish but I did not want to see them suffer any longer.

One with adult friends, the other with our children (ages 11 & 12).  Captain Alex put us right on the fish! The crew took care of everything; all we had to do was reel  'em in! We caught our limit of red snappers both times.  There was plenty of excitement each time, and many laughs! The Miss Carli is beautiful, and very well-maintained. Comfortable seating for those seeking sun, and those who need the shade. I highly recommend the folks at Pleasure Island Charters. They love what they do, and it shows!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07830f26e02b:0xddbf7aa2c4b26286"}

We booked the 8 hour trip.  We caught Red Snapper ( which we could not keep - not in season), White Snapper, Grouper , Wahoo, B-LIners, 2 large Bull Sharks, and more.  The boat is awesome.  Captain Alex is great and knows where the fish are. The crew ( Perry) was very friendly and worked super hard to keep us fishing all day. We had a great day on the water thanks to Alex and the crew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07830f26e02b:0xddbf7aa2c4b26286"}
