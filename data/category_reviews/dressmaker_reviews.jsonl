She planned to \"let out 3 inches\" of the waistline. I called her shop to check the status of my gown the day I was told it would be finished and she implied to me that she hadn't even started altering it yet. She asked for 3 more days (making it 10 days before my wedding day). 3 days later I went to try on my dress and I could not even remotely zip up the entire top half of my dress ( which was not the case when dropped it off to her..I could not comfortably zip it up and maybe had 1\" that I couldn't zip). I believe she took it in 3\" instead of letting it out. After informing me there was no fabric left to let it back out, she then proceeded to embarrass me in front of other people in her shop. She asked if I could find better undergarments to \"suck all of that in\". When I replied that apart from removing a rib or two this is as good as it gets for me, she said \"honey...there is more than just ribs going on here.\" She said \"I can't think of anything to fix this. If I do, I will call you in the next two days.\" I did everything I could to leave as fast as possible so I could get in my car and cry. Thank goodness for Dillard's having formals and I found a decent replacement the next day (9 days before my wedding). Regardless of her skills as a seamstress on other projects, I will not recommend or return to Christine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e16c2ed7d2b:0x5cddc6f062df4b9"}
