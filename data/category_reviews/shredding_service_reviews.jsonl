You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

Our records indicate that you\u2019ve shipped two packages with us in as many years. One internationally, yes - we must ask questions about your shipment. \u201cWhat are you sending? What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I own a small business that I run out of my home in McMullen Cove (and yes, I do have a license with the City of Huntsville).  I mail packages on a daily basis.  Today, I missed my mail pick up and our local post office had already closed so we drove down to this store so that we could ensure our packages would go out today.  My 12 year old went in first and was refused service.  So, I then took the packages and went inside only to be told that, \"I don't receive anything from the Post Office for compensation and am not required to provide service to you.\"   I asked for her to put that in writing, she refused, spewed some other nastiness until 2 other individuals came in and I told her I would be reporting her to the proper authorities and I left.   As I type this, I am still shaken, that this kind of bigotry and hatred can still exist.  That people feel they have the right to treat others with such vile.  I will not be returning to this location ever and would strongly urge others to also find somewhere else to spend your hard earned money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533411883334, "text": "Wow, I feel I have to respond to this - this goes beyond misleading and is simply a lie.

We really try hard to make every customers experience here a very good one. As I explained to you when you were here - your postal labels would not scan. I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan. Again, I'm sorry that you are not happy, but please don't make a racial issue out of a situation that race simply had no bearing. That is extremely sad.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

I had searched as best as I could online to determine if UPS had a main warehouse in the area to which I could have a package delivered.  I kept getting redirected to the local UPS stores, like this one.  I even called the UPS customer service line to find out if there was a local warehouse, and was placed on hold for 30 mins before I gave up.  I then checked for a local UPS store (again, including this location), went to the location\u2019s website, copied the address, and used it for shipping.\n\n***At no point was there any indication from the primary UPS website or this local UPS store website that any charges may be incurred for using the address for shipping***\n\nSo, as the clerk brought my box to me, they stated there would be a $5 charge.  Surprised, I asked why and was told it was because I used their location as a shipping address.  I was also informed by the clerk the location was not an \u201cactual\u201d UPS location, so there were extra fees that may be incurred. I said I understood, and asked they show me any literature that indicated there was a charge for using the location for my shipping.  They could not produce any literature, documentation, or point out anywhere on their website that this particular service would incur a fee.  However, the clerk did advise if I had simply called the store ahead of time to ask about shipping, they would\u2019ve informed me about the charge.\n\nIn this day and age, who calls for quick info unless it\u2019s a last resort? And why aren\u2019t these charges posted on UPS corporate site or on the local store\u2019s site?  Where\u2019s the transparency?\n\nI tried to give them the benefit of the doubt - I stepped out of line so they could assist other customers and I searched online on my phone for any indication of a charge for this service and found none.  So, really folks, this store - based on their logic - could hold your package ransom for whatever amount they want: $5, $15, $20?  The charge is not posted anywhere, they have your shipment, and won\u2019t release it until you pay.\n\nAfter a fun back-and-forth between me and the manager (?), she finally, out of the \u201cgoodness of her heart\u201d (she essentially spat those words out at me), allowed me to take my shipment without charging me.  She also made certain she made some serious notes near my pick-up signature for her future reference.  Finally, as I was leaving, she made one of those passive-aggressive comments to her colleague, but loud enough to be certain I heard it, something to the extent of: \u201call of this over $5?!\u201d  I responded, \u201cYes. Over $5.\u201d  There have been many times when $5 made or broke my week.\n\nI completely understand and support a business\u2019s right to charge whatever they want for whatever products or services. However, we should not be ransomed into paying some arbitrary, unpublished, hidden charge that we are surprised with at the counter before we can pick up a package. This is the digital age - there is no reason that charge can\u2019t be easily - and prominently - be listed on their website.  Or even printed on one of their many signs behind the counter, or even on a menu of costs/services that they can hand the customer.  Where is the transparency??  But there was nothing other than the word of the clerk.  In this day and age, and in a business that aligns itself with such a large delivery corporation, that lack of information is egregious, especially due to how easy of a fix it is - just update the damned website.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f0c76816d65:0xbc02540c826f8b7c"}

After following through with a phone call to UPS, I was informed that a claim was never filed from the UPS store.\n\nBottom line: UPS caused the initial delivery failure due to a mis-sorting error, and failed to stand behind their product/service using \"policy\" over the customer.\n\nThe UPS Store on Madison Blvd compounded the failure by failing to submit the reimbursement claim, and then lying to me directly regarding the circumstance - also failing to stand behind their product/service.\n\nSerendipity: I am finding the FedEx facility more helpful (adding extra tape when they think it would be helpful without charging be a package fee as I was subject to elsewhere ... Read UPS store. Also, I'm finding that FedEx shipping rates are as much as $10 cheaper than I had paid at the UPS store as some destinations included a \"delivery surcharge.\"\n\nThank you, FedEx!!!\n\n-----------------------\n8/23/2016 Update\n\nRegarding the letter mentioned in the reply by Lori (store owner) I asked for a copy of that before I posted my initial review and was told it was an internal document and was not permitted to view it. And it does not change the fact that UPS told me specifically that they did not receive a claim request.\n\nSo whether the fault lies with UPS or the UPS Store, I now ship FedEx.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1471566484687, "text": "Mr. Lynch, Thank you for using The UPS Store Madison. I apologize that The UPS Store and UPS did not meet your expectations. The UPS Store Madison did file a Guaranteed Service Refund (GSR) on June 17, 2016 for you. The refund was denied on June 20, 2016 by UPS not The UPS Store Madison. The reason the GSR was denied is because refunds must be requested within 15 calendar days from the date the package was delivered. We at The UPS Store (a 3rd Party Retailer) challenged the decision by UPS and the claim was still denied. We have a copy of all the paper work if you would like to come by our location to look at it.

Unfortunately, The UPS Store is a \"3rd Party Retailer.\" Being said, our store is not responsible for operations of the \"UPS brown truck.\" Another possibility you are experiencing is a UPS SurePost shipping method. The SurePost option allows UPS to \"deliver\" the package to your local area postal service, for them finish the delivery to your estate. Once UPS delivers the package to the Postal Service, you may still get a notification it has been \"delivered\". Unfortunately, that would only mean it was delivered to them. With that service, processing can sometimes take 2-3 days. That is the most common issue with that particular service, It is always best to verify with the shipper as to what shipping method they have used for your package. With that being said, The UPS Store can offer a guaranteed delivery date and time for packages that we send out of our store! If you would like more information, please give us a call or stop by. We look forward to seeing you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626f0c76816d65:0xbc02540c826f8b7c"}

We are ten folks from Birmingham who do graphic design and digital and wide-format printing and offer UPS, USPS, and DHL services as a third-party vendor.\n\nYour complaint against the United Parcel Service, Inc is an understandable one, but rating our location 1* won't accomplish any change. We aren't the logistics company based out of Atlanta, and this location isn't owned by them either. Your review is understandably but incorrectly levied at us, and that hurts our business, despite that fact that we don't operate UPS trucks, nor do we maintain UPS drop boxes.\n\nWe know the name \"The UPS Store\" makes us sound like a corporate entity, but we're not, or else we couldn't say that the name \"The UPS Store\" was a stupid choice for loosely-affiliated franchises.\n\nWe would kindly ask that you remove your rating if you are not one of our customers, or that you correct your rating to reflect our service correctly if you have commissioned work from us before. Again, that would really help our locally owned small business thrive. We can also put you in touch with people at UPS who can actually help get your complaint to the right people. Please feel free to come in and see us, or email us at Store4088@TheUPSStore.com.

The person I was dealing with was so horrible and incompetent that after 5-6 phone calls over 3 days(and zero of 4 emails responded to, emails with all the pertinent information for items to be picked up, packed and shipped) I asked to speak to a manager, well Bradley WAS the manager.  Great.  I asked if he had a supervisor or the owner and he dismissively told me HE was in charge - this is where the attitude ramped up, before it was somewhat subtle.\n\nHe would not respond to any email asking for quotes or telling me when they would pick up the items (the pickup service they offer).  It was like he didn't want to have record of the quotes or times in email.  He would respond to direct questions in email with \"would you please just call me, how hard is that\" - as if my schedule revolved around him.\n\nAfter 3 weeks of trying to get them to pick up the auction lot, I made arrangements with another UPS store that would pick up the same day.  I called to cancel at the previous store, told Kody (who told Bradley while I was on the phone) and someone else as well and I also emailed the cancellation.  3-4 hours later they used the paperwork from the first email to pick up the items and I was informed by the other UPS store that the items were already picked up (the seller wasn't supposed to release it to them either but that isn't as much their fault)\n\nWhen they packed up the items they used a huge box, about 3x larger than what was actually necessary basically tripling the cost of everything. It was very expensive now.  I knew this wasn't right so I emailed asking for the weight and dimensions of the box he used, and I got a reply of the dimensions and a \"just call us\" response.  This was after I had called 4-5 times that day and they were always too busy to talk.  Now he wanted me to call immediately (6 hours after the my first call) and when I didn't he proceeded to call 6 times in 30 minutes while I was  on the other line (call waiting beeping 40-50 times for each call, he just let it ring harassing me - I couldn't end my call it was important and why I called 6 hours prior and used email).\n\nThis harassment continued 3 more times with about 2-3 calls each time until their closing time (total of about 13-15 calls, ringing non-stop b/c no voicemail turned on).\n\nMy calls the next two days were hung up on, I never knew who answered the phone, but 5 calls were immediately hung up on when they were switched to an employee.\n\nI called the other UPS store I had scheduled and told them what was going on and was going to have them pick up the items to ship.  I was informed of who to ask for at the other store and that they would be helpful.  I called back and got someone I hadn't worked with - Mikee.\n\nThis was a delight. From the very beginning the attitude was like night and day.  Bradley has no business working with customers or in customer service.  Mikee was helpful, promptly returning emails with complete answers and readable sentences, complete quotes, etc.  Included in the emails were the photos of how Bradley wrapped the items and it looked like a 4yr old had done it.\n\nThere were a couple fragile items, noted 3-4 times in previous emails (maybe Bradley can't read, IDK) that were to be wrapped in bubble wrap b/c they were glass.  These were the only things not in bubble wrap.  The large bulky durable plastic items were layered in bubble wrap and I told him they didn't need ANY.  So, Mikee took everything out of Bradley's packaging and re-packaged the items and did an EXCELLENT job.  I would rate that  part 5 stars,  but after 3+ weeks with Bradley, 1 star is too much.\n\nThe final shipping was less than 1/2 what Bradley quoted (and it wasn't $5 vs $10, it was MUCH higher).  The items arrived and everything looks to be in  order.\n\nI just can't understand how this business can make Bradley a manager and deal with customers. I had another problem with  them 1 year ago with bad packaging on a piece of glassware, it looked like a 4yr old wrapped it too.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553624970087, "text": "Thank you so much for your review.

Every single The UPS Store location is an individual franchise operating under The UPS Store, Inc. brand, a brand that is a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Parcel Service. We are not 'affiliates,' we are a child company that is both wholly owned and legally distinct from UPS, Inc. As such, we are required to follow UPS corporate policy as well as The UPS Store Corporate policy. This is not unique to ours or any other The UPS Store location.\n\nUPS requires all UPS Customer Centers and The UPS Store locations to maintain their own 'Third Party Account' (also known as a UPS Shipping Account) and does not allow for any entity with a Shipping Account to ship using another entity's account number.\n\nWe, as The UPS Store Southside, would love to be able to accept these account numbers for payment, but we are explicitly forbidden from doing so. We do, however, apologize for the inconvenience this caused you. As you'll recall, when you came in on Friday, November 3rd at around 2pm, our associate did attempt to explain this to you. While we understand better than most just how confusing and frustrating some UPS regulations and policies can be, especially from the outside-looking-in, we feel that describing our staff as discourteous is, at the very least, misleading.\n\nWe hope this adequately resolves any lingering confusion, and if that's not the case, we invite you to reach out to us for further clarification.\n\nThanks!\n~Management"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc491c8eda7:0x8903c5dbd49cb474"}

The order I picked up today from Michaels was mislabelled, so instead of a tablet I got an Apple TV that I now have to take off work (again) to return.

Our certified packing experts packaged your canvas according to corporate standards, using a quality shipping box and packaging materials, to protect and insure it against loss and damage during transit with our Pack and Ship Guarantee. We hope you can see the value in allowing us to pack your fragile item. Again, we apologize for the misleading estimate you received online.

From the only employee I\u2019ve ever seen there (Jay?) to the actual customer service online. The employee clearly wasn\u2019t trained on how to properly communicate to customers as there are a couple of issues that I would like to point out from that alone. He speaks in a manner that tells me, \u201cGet out of my face, I don\u2019t want to deal with this,\u201d or \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about and you don\u2019t,\u201d which seems to not be the case as I\u2019m reading the everlasting one-star ratings. We walk into the store with no one at the front office and him doing whatever that he does. After the wait, he comes out, talking on the phone. I cannot even begin to explain how and why this was extremely disrespectful and even offending. We were having issues with the transaction of our package, however the way handled this was- to say the least- atrocious. He started muttering under his breath in his language, no doubt something less than appropriate in the workforce, directly to our faces. Not to mention the stench of smoke was absolutely putrid in this building. It\u2019s atrocious. I was thankful I had my mask, but it was still so strong that I couldn\u2019t wait to exit the establishment (from both his attitude and the stench). Speaking of masks, he did not have one throughout the entire time I came in. In a pandemic. Do I need to elaborate any further? In case you thought there couldn\u2019t be any more wrong with this situation, I called customer service and got hung up twice. The third time they tell me I have to make an account on their website in order to have any of my questions answered. That is by far the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard and if they wasn\u2019t enough, when I actually made an account, they acted as if I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think they actually allow customer service calls at all and this is their way of doing so. This is just for this location because I called customer service for every other UPS near me and they picked up right away. I am 110% sure that Jay is the reason I cannot call, as he was using the phone for his own personal enjoyment. I have nothing to say about this entire matter except that I will never be going here again.

Paid a whopping $172.00 to ship them (about 50 pounds total).  I noticed late that night that the tracking only said \"label has been produced\" but none of the usual arrival/departure scans.  Package was promised to be delivered by November 10.\n\nNext day I called and the owner/manager? (Patel) told me it was put on a truck to the UPS facility in Birmingham that same day.  Still no tracking.  I called the next day, same story and still no tracking.  Thursday night I contacted UPS (not this rag-tag store) and initiated a lost package (2) investigation.  That dragged on through the weekend.  Monday I called the local UPS store and was again guaranteed it had left their store on the 7th.  I called UPS that afternoon and they were still looking.\n\nI noticed that last night (November 13) the package magically showed up with an arrival scan at the local UPS facility in Homewood.  One week late.  I tried to call the UPS store a dozen times this morning but get the \"this number has not set up a voice mail...\"  I called the missing package group at UPS again and they told me it had been in the local UPS store the entire week., was found and shipped last night.  But that is not the end of the story.\n\nThe tracking now shows delivery is scheduled for Thursday, November 24.  This store was too sorry to upgrade the shipping after they had held it for a week.  I would suggest to everyone that you do NOT ship from this location.  The Alabaster UPS store told me they had heard plenty of complaints about this store.  UPS should close them down.\n\nI wish there was something worse than one star to give them.  Worst customer service I have ever had.  Then they lie to me about it being shipped.

I went to have invites printed while on my lunch break which typically does not take long. The owner Matthew Bass first stated that I would not be able to fit two 5x5 invites on one sheet of paper which is clearly incorrect. The owner proceeded to assist 3 customers which came in after I did and then stated that he could resize the invites or I could do it myself but I would have to come back. I again stated to him that I was on my lunch break and would need the print job done asap. He then stated I can't expect to come in and have a print job done immediately and I told him to dont worry about it. He proceeded to give me my flash drive and I asked who was the manager and he stated he was the owner and I stated you have wasted my time and I could have went to another store which would have been more helpful. The owner then stated well you have wasted my time with your attitude which was very rude. I felt that he did not know how to do the job and proceeded to push me off so he did not have to do it. I have been to two other UPS Stores which can have the print job done in 10-15 mins tops. I will never go to this store again\n\nAs you can see below the manager response is still rude and inaccurate. Again if you would like better service visit another UPS store.

We do not offer print on demand, especially when customer jobs need to be resized and cut, as did yours. You forgot to mention that you walked out to your car, and that is when other customers were helped. You also forgot to mention that the owner was working by himself as his employee was at lunch. A print job that was emailed earlier in the morning was being produced and we have one color machine, so it's impossible to work on 2 print jobs at the same time. So, that order would have been completed first. That's why you were offered to leave your flash drive and come back. We do know that more than one file, 5x5, fits on one page. The owner misspoke because his mind was on the other print job. We produce hundreds of these type of print jobs (invites, note cards, business cards, etc) each year and would be happy to assist you in the future. The best way for us to produce print jobs is when customers email us their files: store0924@theupsstore.com and let us know when they are needed. Then, we can provide an accurate quote and time, so the customer doesn't have to wait in the store, especially if they are busy like you were."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220c0887b63d:0x32dc52a4bc4e260b"}

I went in yesterday to drop off a package. They were swamped and it was a 45 minute wait. The wait was not the issue. It's December and I expected there to be a wait. The issue was that there was no social distancing encouraged in the small lobby space! There were 13 people crammed in a small area at one point + employees. There was one employee not wearing a mask at all. She kept walking around in the front area and making trips out the front door through the crowds of people. Another had on a 3\" chin visor mask, that let's be honest, wasn't protecting anyone. As someone that is high-risk and being very careful about being around people, this was an incredibly uncomfortable (but unfortunately necessary) trip to the UPS store for me.  The gentleman behind me also expressed how uncomfortable he was with the thought of having to step inside the lobby with so many people. In fact, we both hung back and allowed people to filter out before going inside, only to have many more people cram in behind us just moments after we walked in.\n\nWe've been at this pandemic thing for months. Concern for safety is not new. Why was there no one at this location telling people, \"So sorry guys, only 5 allowed inside at a time so we can keep everyone safe.\"  Not to mention the fact the if I have to wear my mask to enter the building, WHY are employees not required to wear proper masks as well?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608217204865, "text": "I am sorry that you had a bad experience.  We have signage on the door requesting our customers to maintain social distancing while in the store as well as placards on the floor spaced ~6 ft apart to aid in the effort to maintain social distancing.  We had hoped that these aids would have been sufficient for our customers to self police.  During the remainder of the holiday season and as needed we will begin having someone at the door to help our customers to maintain the proper social distancing during our busiest periods.  I will review our store video to see which of the employees did not have a mask on and take the appropriate actions.\n\nThank You and I do Apologize\nLarry Stephens"}, "gmap_id": "0x887d49f0097d57fb:0x207fe40533012e28"}

No, she was not. I quickly grabbed the package and left the store. I drove over to USPS down the road and went in to have the package shipped. The total cost for priority mail ended up being $32.50.

His reason for not redoing was because nationwide rep was not present in store with me and it would be illegal for him to do so. I request a refund for his document error. At first his stance was services were rendered because the dicument has been accepted in the past and its his principles (whatever they were). Finally we agree that he should issue a refund. He soon changed his mind and after I suggested him and his wife get on one accord with the policy and look into new notary standards. Razuel ordered me to leave because I should just be quiet (his words).

Came in to pick up extra  mechanical pencils and note cards while in the area and went to the check out.  No one was running the registers, but three employees were behind customer service (2 high school/early college age male and female, as well as a older female)  The two young employees were actively engaged in a conversation, one makes eye contact while the other has back turned but continues with conversation.  The older female notices me as well and has to tell the younger female with her back 4 times to return to her register.  She goes to register, doesn't greet me or ask if I found everything alright.  Instead only asks if I want to sign up for a membership a few times after I decline repeatedly.  She puts my order in the bag and walks off before I can take my card out of the chip reader and back into my wallet.  Didn't even get a thank you for shopping.  Will not return again since staff doesn't want to make their customers feel welcomed or care if they make the sell. Will just order supplies from Amazon in advance, or go to Walmart in a pinch.

She writes, \"What good is the UPS store if I can\u2019t ship postal packages.. just one more inconvenience because people can\u2019t do their jobs right!!!\" This review needs to be directed to the USPS, not the UPS store, she named the wrong entity in her review. She is correct about people not doing their job because that's the very reason the UPS store stopped taking prepaid USPS packages, because the USPS can't do their job. They lose packages, packages are delayed because they can't do their job and the UPS store should not have to take the blame for the USPS inadequate culture. So guess what? They don't have to take any more of the blame because they can't provide an accommodation for a service that is so inept in which they get blamed for.

We told the employee that we wanted the most economical option - the contents were valuable and needed insurance (china, books, birdhouse, rug, etc.), but speed was not a concern.  We were told 3 day residential was the cheapest option.\n\nOne of the five boxes was completely crushed during shipment and several china pieces were broken despite purchasing nearly $100 of bubble wrap and china specific packaging supplies.  I filed a claim with UPS, provided pictures, etc.  Without inspecting the box, UPS ultimately denied the claim because there was a sweater in the package that I'd sent in the box to free up room for stuff in my luggage.  UPS claimed it was inappropriate packaging material even though it was just part of the contents.  UPS would not discuss the denial with me because UPS deemed the UPS Store as the shipper (not me).\n\nDuring the claims process, I found out that ground service was available and would have been ~$200 less expensive.\n\nI called the UPS store and spoke to the manager.  I started by telling her about the insurance denial.  She said it was not their issue since they didn't package the box.  I agreed, but told her UPS will only speak with them (as the shipper) and that they needed to act on my behalf to help resolve the issue.  I next mentioned that we could have shipped the boxes via ground for less money and that staff misled us.  She became INCREDIBLY RUDE and told me the staff just recommended that service - not that it wasn't the cheapest option.  I pushed back and asked if she was present at the time of the transaction - she said no.  With no knowledge of the interaction, she continued to blindly and aggressively tell me what her staff said and did.  It was clear the conversation was going nowhere.\n\nA manager from a different location called later.  She said they'd file an appeal with UPS on our behalf.  No followup occurred.\n\nI rarely get fired up, but this experience was AWFUL!  The staff misled and overcharged us.  UPS denied a claim without ever inspecting the box.  UPS would not speak to me despite my family boxing, shipping, paying for and receiving the boxes.  The manager was incredibly rude.  They were unhelpful and failed to help resolve the claim with UPS.\n\nThis is a great store if this is the service you're looking for.\n\nTo make it even worse, as I was filing the dispute with UPS (which took hours and multiple calls), I contacted the UPS Store to get copies of our receipt.  They were helpful and said they'd send over the receipts.  Instead of sending our receipt, they accidentally emailed me a copy of another customer's DRIVERS LICENSE and SOCIAL SECURITY CARD.  I guess you can add careless to the list too.....\n\nFIND ANOTHER WAY/LOCATION TO SHIP YOUR UPS PACKAGES!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d6271b3defb:0x3377d583ad8084ed"}
