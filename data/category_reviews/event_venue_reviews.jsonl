When you call him, he answers the phone or he doesn\u2019t take forever to return your call.  He is very personable and easy to work with. When I tell you this man invests in his property, he does. I have rented it over the years. It has improved from just a kitchen to having everything you need. It has a warmer, chafing racks a rolling cart, a cooler....the list goes on. It is well kept. The restrooms are clean. Mr. Jones is very accommodating and his prices are reasonable. He doesn't allow alcohol and I'm sure that has contributed to the longevity of his facility.

I brought my girlfriend here to partake in splatter painting as one of our anniversary activities. The reservation process was quick and effortless on their website. You walk in and have your temp taken, you're given a squirt of sanitizer for your hands and then you sign your waiver if you did not already complete this step online. After completing the waiver a super friendly employee directed us to a table that had been set up with a cute anniversary sign, decorations, chocolate, champagne and our blank canvas. We were then able to add designs with tape that would be peeled off post splatter painting while enjoying our glass of champagne. Once we finished our champagne, part 2 of the fun began. We were taken to the splatter paint room where we put on our protective wear over our clothes, shoe protectors and goggles. While an employee went over the basics, we were given a bluetooth speaker to play music,  they exited, turned off the lights, we blasted our music and the anniversary paint party began! You reserve the room for an hour so you can splatter till you can't splatter anymore. Once finished, one of the owners came in to grab our masterpiece to place on the table to have the tape peeled off and allow it to dry a little. We took off all protective gear, wiped what little paint got on our faces off and decided to sit at their cute bar station to have a couple margaritas and a beer. They have a decent selection of snacks and drinks. The strawberry margaritas were sooooo good. You can easily kill some time while your paint is trying to dry. My girlfriend and I got the pleasure of meeting and speaking to the owners who happen to be husband and wife. They were nothing short of a delight! Wonderful personalities, warm and welcoming. They informed us about their various craft classes that another group was doing. This particular group was making candles and they let us know what a great and fun experience they had. My girlfriend and I will certainly be back to try one of the crafts out. If you're looking for something fun and different,  come here. The owners deserve all of Bham's business!

The only thing added during the 5 month planning stage was the actual bathroom stall (at least we can relieve ourselves in private), a laundry room door, and partial HVAC system. Then they promised the floor would be cleaned at least...it was not! There were approx. 80 wet mattresses next to the building that were promised to be moved by the \"workers\". The wedding party had to move the wet mattresses to keep from looking like a city dump while the self proclaimed \"COL\" Joe(enlisted navy of 4 yrs does NOT make you a Colonel) stood with his hands on his hips and ordering where to put them. When the 3 workers were asked by the groom's mom and bride to help with the mattresses they replied \"We are busy hanging these wasp catchers\" then proceeded to flip the middle finger at one another for about 5 minutes...(how many camp liberty workers does it take to hang one wasp catcher) I have to say, the ONE star ONLY represents the GREAT ability the owner has at ordering commands to the wedding party and their helpers. Joe, the owner, brought strangers (to solicit) into the bridal suite and lodging with our personal belongings (purses, wallets, clothing, luggage, ect) unannounced while we were attending the reception. This was discovered when the bride and groom's moms went to change after the wedding. Later we found that he had released the brides beloved dog into the outdoors and didn't notify anyone. The owner later hovered at the reception then uninvited, went to help himself to the catering service(that WE provided) before all the guests had a chance to eat!

We thought the location was beautiful and would be worth the price paid.  We appreciated that he was prior military and this place prides it\u2019s self on service to our country.  Our family is heavily populated with current and former military. We thought this location would be amazing but it WAS NOT. The owner was not consistent and frequently changed the rules, saying he was more than accommodating.  He advised that he had previously had a brides mother escorted out, by police, for \u201cnit-picking\u201d, which is what he did the entire wedding. I guess this was to act as a warning to us. The bridal area was very pretty but smelled of sewage that seeped from the bathrooms.\n\nWhen we arrived to decorate the day before the wedding we realized the reception area was filthy.  We had to go buy cleaning products. The groom had to clean the beams and walls of spider webs and bugs. The bathroom was full of fruit flies, knats, spiders, and other bugs.  The windows were all so dirty you couldn\u2019t see out of them. The location was definitely left in a better condition than we found it. In a written document he wrote \u201che takes out the garbage\u201d.  We bagged all of the garbage and left it in one location (that he saw when he did the inspection and refunded the entire deposit since we cleaned and followed all the rules); however, the following day the owner sent a picture via text showing that the garbage had been ransacked by animals since HE left it outside all night.  He has a dog that roams. This is very unprofessional as some are afraid or allergic to dogs.\n\nLike most weddings, the ceremony started a little late. We rented the location for the entire day so timing was not an issue. 10 minutes after the set start time, the owner went to the groom stated the ceremony was to start at four and is late and then began to tap his watch.  At one point, he pulled up a chair and sat directly in the middle of the room and stared at the bridal party as we were getting ready to start the ceremony.\n\nMany of our guest complained to us about feeling extremely uncomfortable with him and his constant hovering.

We overlooked that and wanted to proceed with the event so nothing was said. He made some of my wedding party and guest feel very uncomfortable. Our ceremony started late which was fine but I was told after by my husband that he came up to him taping his watch questioning why we were running late and then pulls up a chair in the basement where the bridal party was sitting and watched us as we were getting ready to line up and start the ceremony. Our arrangement was we would contact him via hand radio so he can come and let some of my family load chairs into his truck so we could transport them to the reception hall so my guest would have seats at dinner. When the lady who came to do my makeup was packing up during the ceremony Mr. Joe went in there and told her about having to have the mother of the bride at a wedding he had there escorted out and informed her that with his experience if there is alcohol there is a problem. We did not have any issues i must say. I hired an officer as well as i had a guest that is high up on the local police force. He hooverd so much I\u2019m assuming in anticipation that something would happen that he made us feel uncomfortable.\nWe were told he provided all tables and chairs but then the Monday before when my husband and I did our walk through he informed us about us having to have some people to help move the chairs from the chapel to the reception hall because he did not have enough or we could rent some. While we were doing the walk through my husband realized how dirty the windows and chapel/reception hall was. He is extremely OCD and was very agitated by that. I, however, thought perhaps he would have it cleaned up by Saturday. I was wrong. We ended up having to clean the window and sweep down cobwebs and bugs throughout the hall. My father wanted to buy curtains for the windows because it was so bad. We didn\u2019t complain to him about the state of the venue we just did what needed to be done. When we did the after walk through my mother told him there had been a horrible sewage smell in the bathroom where the bridal party was getting ready and he responded nothing I can do know. She was just letting him know for future reference but he was a smart alec my mother let it go. During the walk through of the reception he mentioned the garbage we had it piled up together. My father told him that on the hand written receipt for the deposit Mr. Joe gave him stated the \u201cowner/president would take garbage out.\u201d Mr Joe then said oh I was being a smart a**.  At that point I walked away because I did not want to cause a scene. We left the garbag in bags piled up by the door Mr Joe gave the full deposit back to my father. The buildings we used were left in 100 times better condition the when we arrived. Sunday morning he sent a picture of the trash where I\u2019m assuming due to him leaving it out all night an animal or his dog that he lets run freely got into some of it. But all he sent was the picture nothing else no text and even when my dad responsed to him 3 times he never responded back. We really loved the fact of how patriotic the owner and workers are. We appreciated what they do there. I come from a family with a lot of military and most were there that day. Overall my day was still extremely special and amazing but I feel he has bad business practice and wasn\u2019t very prepared for our event.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88882e10d1d15b25:0xa905bf839feafe24"}

What started out as a great deal quickly turned into a nightmare. In 4 short months joe land turned our planning into a militant experience.  From directing wedding party members and family members to perform laborious tasks to bringing visitors into our private event and taking pictures, eating the reception food uninvited to telling me to pick up cigarette butts that his hired wedding planner smoked and finally telling family members that checks bounced due to his lack of ability to follow instruction the entire experience was exhausting and a scam. There were no trash cans at the reception despite several requests, there were no linens until 10 am the day of the wedding , and there was a loaded AR 15 in the chapel... nightmare.   There were potential clients In the privately rented bridal suite where we were changing clothes. Without permission....DO not use this venue!!!!its a joke.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493674057279, "text": "The crux of this review is \"What started out as a great deal\" . We gave a great rate to the customer with the caveats that certain tasks had to be done and our venue was taken care of. For $2500 (not including bounced check fees) the party was provided our chapel, a location for the wedding party to stay for a night and a reception hall. We provided chairs and tables, and a number of other amenities that would not normally be included in a rental cost without an extra charge. This was to allow us to get good pictures to further promote our facility. In the end it resulted in the person who posted this review being told to leave the property with a police escort. To address the most glaring portion of her review is the AR15 statement, this was a lasertag gun that is a service we offer to groups on the camp, not a loaded firearm.\n\nA couple of bad reviews are not great, but are better than the threats of bodily harm from members of the wedding party, those same people who left the building they used in a shambles. We provided a great price to a group because we are dedicated to providing a good service to veterans and their families. As a result we dealt with weeks of demands that only ever increased in scope and did our best to meet the mark as we had an agreement with this family that we would be taking pictures and using the event to help our marketing. This family got the deal of a lifetime and only wanted more and more and we foolishly provided. The linens we rented at an obscene price since it was last minute to make sure the event happened with some class were not part of the original agreement. But due to this group we have updated our policies and contracts so that we are never again forced to clean-up our lodging facility of the tossed around sugar and creamer and various other garbage these people dumped everywhere. The result of this group's use of our venue was a police report of the state of the property after they left."}, "gmap_id": "0x88882e10d1d15b25:0xa905bf839feafe24"}

The decor and finishings are very nice, yet they have TVs on the wall.  The service was great.  The staff seemed helpful and friendly, and everything was clean and well organized.\n\nThe food itself was very tasty.  All the plates (while small compared to the high priced) were creative, well presented, and delicious.  This is a tapas place, meaning you should expect small amounts of food that are a little overpriced.  The stuffed mushrooms, while great, maybe leaned into this idea a little too much.\n\nNow to the cocktails.  The PB&J drink was surprisingly one of the best cocktails I've had.  The other drinks I had were above average for the area and price.\n\nThis place is new and definitely worth a visit or two.  The location is great and easy to get to from the highway, but the parking lot is absolutely terrible.\n\nCome here if you need a break from the 10,000 \"look how unique we are\" hipster breweries around town.

I ordered the Camile club with no mayo. When I received my sandwich, it had mayo. So, I calmly went back up and explained that I didn't want mayo. I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God.

We ended up not even using the venue, and of course everything was labeled \"non-refundable\" since it was all paid in full before canceling.

I'll probably end up picking a better venue for my future wedding unless the owner wants to resolve this issue.\n\nUpdate: Since I can't directly reply, my family member canceled way more than 1 week in advance DUE TO COVID. And so we're the other cancelations and I have PROOF. We paid $2700 to get NO service. We weren't donating to your charity.

I had the ability to go when our youth camp decided to come for summer camp. The camp is run through Student Life Camps and has an amazing group of staff and individuals that help the camp run. The guys in our group including me stayed in Mount Moriah, which is one of the many lodging buildings available to stay in. The rooms were clean and fresh bedding was provided, although we brought our own. I opted to use the provided bedding. The rooms had two bunk beds for a maximum capacity of 4 people. The lower level of Mount Moriah (we stayed in the top level--a two story building) has a nice little lobby area with some chairs and a couch. Some guys in our group thought it would be funny to take the couch upstairs and place it in front of our leader's room. We returned the couch afterwards.\n\nThe rest of the camp was very beautiful and well kept. There were some lawn care professionals maintaining the grounds while we stayed.\n\nThe recreation area, known as the \"Adventure Camp\" was very nice. The pool was large enough for our group to comfortably play in, as well as others. A diving board added to the fun. The Tennis courts and Basketball courts were very nice and well kept, but you will need to bring your own tennis supplies, as they are not provided. There was a small \"lake\" on camp grounds, with paddle boarding, and some water inflatables. We did not decide to go on these as they cost an extortionate amount of $8 for 30 mins of play. Not worth it.\n\nIt would we worth nothing that everything is fairly spread apart and there are some very intense hills throughout, which took a toll on our legs and knees. Golf Cart rentals were available for $35/day, but we had too many in our group that it would cost too much, so we didn't do it.\n\nThe food service was very nice, the food tasted adequate and there was always a variety to choose from. It is a self serve food line, so you are free to eat what you choose. A nice addition is the unlimited complimentary Soft Serve Ice Cream available at each and every meal.\n\nOverall I have to say Shocco Springs is one of my favourite camps that I've been to. Sure it's a little hot here in Alabama, but that's fine. Just bring some water, and going swimming can help tremendously.\n\n-Matthew J., age 15 at time of writing. Visited From June 1-5, 2016.

My daughters engagement pictures and  wedding pictures are full of cats in the ceremony, one cat literally walked down the isle in front of our daughter creating a laughing frenzy that took her aww moment from her as no one paid attention to her . One was cleaning it\u2019s  bottom at the alter, some lying in food servers and eating off the quest tables and several dogs running thru the reception. We had  people holding cats under each arm to keep the cats out of pictures. The video of the wedding can not be heard over the barking of the rescue dogs and the owners personal dogs on the premises. The bridesmaids were constantly having to clean cat poop off their shoes. \ud83e\udd22  The road to the venue is not paved and has become very rough as there is a large amount of logging going on around the venue at this time  (6-1-19). As I am an animal lover a formal venue is not the place to have a rescue and vice versa. There is only one bathroom for guest to use and it was not clean upon us arriving. I had to ask for it to be cleaned as it at hair around the urinal.  The inside of their carriage house which holds the kitchen had dirty floors and filth in the corners where it had not been cleaned well. I would not recommend this venue for any event which is formal or food being served. I also find it very interesting that any bad review on here can be challenged by a \u201cgoogle user\u201d which is probably the owner trying to get their rating back up because if any of my family didn\u2019t agree with me I can promise you they wouldn\u2019t be coward enough to go on the Internet and post anonymously so there\u2019s your proof they are pretty dishonest folks. And who would even care enough about one persons review enough to call them out on it \ud83d\ude44 so come on \u201cgoogle user\u201d throw your real name out there \ud83e\udd23 and all anyone has to do to know I\u2019m right is go out there and look and listen to all the animals.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyitk_oGkeSwI6CabGYRSUL68Lu-YXcoScPU3L=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZsvHjsPD424t3obxTFOg1fEVR600zcZrT_5Qx=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMagK8mdGkaqn3ItwFLmphGWaTM07aiEmBI88ot=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d33716a581e4d:0xb4866265da89e218"}

I didn't recognize your name right off, so I looked in all the reservations to see when you stayed and didn't see your name anywhere.  I can only assume you came as part of a group.  I was looking because I was wanting to respond to the comment but don't have chronology.  I wanted you (and the public reading this) to know that we have added two sparkling new full bathrooms on the main level and they are gorgeous.  The only other thing I could think of was the upstairs hall bath leaking to the lower floor.  We have discovered it only happens once in a while and in those cases the guests didn't put the shower curtain inside the shower.  So mystery solved AND we ordered glass sliding doors for that shower/tub combo to make it virtually leak-roof.  Hoping that clears anything up about \"bathroom amenities needing work\".  To the public reading reviews: this property is well maintained and we have no current issues with bathrooms.  They are all stocked with body wash, shampoo and conditioner.  We even have bar soap and the towels are fluffy and smell amazing.  Thanks Patrick for bringing the possibility of needing improvement as we strive to continuously achieve that.

I visited Dreamcakes Cafe with my mother and sister for afternoon tea. It was such a special day for us because we planned afternoon tea right before they accompanied me to shop for my wedding dress! The staff knew this and were so excited, kind, and encouraging.\n\nWe made our tea selections a few days before our event via email. Kallie was wonderful about responding on email. We had to sign a contract prior to the tea and she made it very easy to do so. When we arrived to the cafe, our tea table was set up with everything we needed: teacups, utensils, saucers, even fresh flowers! The set up was stunning and the food was delicious! I highly recommend the pimento cheese sandwich with peach jam and the macarons!!\n\nDuring the tea, the wait staff made us feel so special. Someone was always by to ensure we had everything we needed, refill cups, etc and all of them were SO polite, friendly, and knowledgable about tea selections. My sister had a gluten and dairy allergy and they made sure she knew what she could and couldn't eat and even brought out a special cup of chicken salad for her.\n\nThank you Dreamcakes staff! You made this such a special day for us. The thought and time you put into the details of our tea was noticed and SO appreciated. It was perfect from start to finish. Hope to see yall again soon... we will be back!!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONY-oJn9BWzuTdb2Fi3h6atL79YWPl-U63vkJQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPHHd3s1HgC_MYEB8GlhgLV96Lk0wjV05Aiz7P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1626716965329, "text": "Thank you so much Erin!

When Elena and Owen would happen to stop by the restaurant I worked at, they would always make a point to come say hello to me.  When sharing news on social media, they were usually one of the first to wish me congratulations.\nWhen we had to unfortunately downsize our wedding to less than 10% of what the original capacity was, they were so supportive of our decisions. The worst I felt when cancelling my \"dream\" wedding was knowing that I couldn't celebrate with this amazing family whom I began to feel really connected with over the two years we've known them.\nThis venue and the people that run it are a dream, and they are the only ones I truly recommend in this area with no doubt in my mind.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862cd58742aec71:0x4164b9312aad6a42"}

They take the time to explain what it takes to fire at the range with ease, and have a cushy waiting area to view a quick training video. The whole process was smooth and easy.\n\nThe range safety officers are well on their game. I felt safe the entire time on the range, and they were able to quickly explain the touch screen track interface, and further explaining that safety is a top priority.\n\nI signed on for 30 minutes, and decided to fire my .40 before testing the shotgun. The touch screen interface has me sold on coming back to bullet and barrel. With just a click, the target goes the exact distance. Takes all the guesswork out of the experience.\n\nI fired my pistol, and was pleased with the range itself. The design is new and clean. And with the RSOs keeping an eye on everything, it's a great environment to enjoy your firearms.\n\nI tried the 88, and it performed beautifully. I added some extra cushion due to a shoulder injury. For those that would ask, you can't shoot bird shot here. But you can fire buck shot and slugs. But I'll tell you, it's fun firing a shotgun at this range.\n\nAfterward I wandered around and struck up conversations with some of the staff, and showed me a selection for sale. I was impressed with the inventory, as well as pricing. I see myself buying my next firearm from here.\n\nFor me, it's a bit of a drive from Madison.

The range facilities are up to date, very comfortable and the RSOs are very professional.\n\nHowever, I made the mistake of using the gunsmith services. This has not gone well. This particular saga has been going on since the end of November. I always had to call or email them to get any status and the answer was always the same...it will be ready Saturday, it will be ready next week, it will be ready \"sometime next week\". I do not believe that they have devoted any significant time to my project. The first time I checked in with them after a week, that is when they informed me I needed to bring in other components. They never reached out to me. Very frustrating. Now that it is in Jan I have given up working with them and I am now taking the project somewhere else.\n\nI get the feeling that they want to work on things when they feel like it, have no obligation to provide status or time estimate to the customer. Furthermore, I do not believe that they have fulltime gunsmiths which feels a little misleading from the website.\n\nSo if any readers know a professional, hardworking gunsmith in the area I am certainly looking!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591656700106, "text": "Hey JB! we're so sorry this was your experience.

Do not sign a contract with Adam\u2019s Acres, and do not trust them. Adam\u2019s Acres has been operating for less than a year. I was the first bride to book Adam\u2019s Acres. I booked them when all that Brittany Adam\u2019s had to show was studs and pictures of what it would look like when completed. I took a huge risk and trusted Brittany. Now, I regret that decision.\n\nDue to the COVID shutdowns in March, I was forced to postpone my April wedding. All of the dates I had to choose from included holiday dates or August dates. We picked August 15th thinking that COVID would be over by then. However, COVID-19 cases are worse now than they were in April. After a lot of praying and talking to relatives, a month from our wedding, we made the decision to postpone our wedding again! This is not at all what we wanted to do, but for the safty of our family and friends we felt it was necessary. Brittany, being the heartless person she is, refused to give us another Friday-Saturday date in 2021. She offered a Sunday date with our rehearsal dinner being on a Thursday. That would not work for religious purposes and the fact that we have so many out of town guests.  She said \u201cwe would cut into her 2021 revenue if she gave us a Friday-Saturday date\u201d. The only way we would be able to have a Friday-Saturday date is to pay the new 2021 rate of $3500.00 when we have already paid in full of $2500.00. Not only will she not let us postpone to a Friday- Saturday date in 2021, she refuses to give us a refund.\n\nShe has stolen our money and has taken advantage of the COVID-19 situation!!

COVID-19 has been a nightmare for everyone and we understand your frustration.\nWhen the State of Alabama shut down all businesses we rescheduled affected couples. It was heartbreaking for our couples and incredibly difficult for our small business that had been operating less than 6 months. We were so happy to have Fall dates still available, but we will be very honest...it has been difficult trying to recover from all the bookings we lost because of reschedules, especially when we didn't qualify for any assistance. We are thankful that unlike a lot of businesses we were able to survive and didn't have to close our doors.\nWhen we rescheduled you to August 14th/15th, we held that date for you and turned away other couples and parties that contacted us for that date. Unfortunately when you cancel 3 weeks prior, it is impossible to re-book.\nWe have been open and safely hosting events again since May 30th. Every single couple has been dealing with the uncertainty of COVID and taking precautions to keep everyone safe. We offered to discuss these options with you as well. The mother of the bride tonight told us, \"I know it wasn't as big as they planned, but they are finally married and we felt SAFE.\" Yesterday\u2019s couple rented additional tables to put outside to further socially distance. All weddings have provided masks and had hand-sanitizer readily available. Tonight's bride also live-streamed her event so that her grandmother (who could not attend because of her assisted-living's COVID policies) could watch her get married. Vendors are wearing masks, caterers are hiring extra staff to safely serve everyone, our venue has extra staff at events for sanitizing... Everyone is making compromises and working hard to keep everyone safe.\nWe are in no way downplaying the seriousness of this virus. We also have no idea when it will end. We understood the reason for your cancellation and although it goes against our cancellation policy, we were empathetic and offered you a Sunday date in 2021 with no additional payments required. When you told us that interfered with your religion, we again offered for a Monday-Thursday. We are so sorry that none of those options worked for you.\nWeddings are such an emotional time for everyone and we understand your disappointment. We know that all couples and wedding vendors alike have been thrown into incredibly difficult situations.

While it hasn't been ideal for anyone, we have had open and honest communication throughout the process. Only 1 bride out of those 9 affected refused to communicate with us via phone and requested that communication be only between our attorneys. We honored her request. All brides affected were offered comparable Saturday dates and we even offered to extend those date options into 2021 if they still desired a Spring wedding. For those who were in school-- they were offered dates while school was not in session including dates during the Summer, Fall break dates, Winter break dates, and of course Spring 2021. We always try to work with our brides and their families and will continue to offer alternative dates for the 1 bride who has not yet rescheduled.

The Q stew, i.e.:Brunswick stew is a winner. ALL PORK AND BEEF platters, inside or outside chopped, served with 1 or 2 sides,  French bread or cornbread will fill you up with a to-go box for sure. The ribs fall off the bone,  and I truly recommend the chef salad.  All dressings are homemade. Price per person is about $10-14 for a full meal. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea are outstanding. Don't forget dessert.  The pecan pie and lemon pie are the best around. If you've got the time to wait, their steaks are excellent too. Chopped steak is my favorite, the fried chicken fingers are so crisp and tender. My kids love them. They cater too, and do a very good job.

I LOVE Columbus Country BBQ and longed for it. About 3pm when we first walked in, the Mgr told us \"to walk over there, grab a menu and seat where ever we wanted\". There was 2 other couples in dining area. The waitress was outstanding!! I don't remember her name, but she was super bubblely. But we were so disappointed with the food. I ordered my usual; pulled pork platter. Husband ordered his usual; 1/2 chicken. Well the pork was drowned in chutney n coleslaw juices, which totally ruined the taste mainly b/c I don't like chutney. I used a numerous amount of napkins to dry up the juice. Husband's chicken looked liked it was cooked the day before or real early that morning. The BBQ sauce was dried and skin was wrinkled up and some spots were burnt. It was very dry. Husband informed waitress and she was very helpful and offered another one, fresher or something else. He ordered another chicken. The 2nd chicken was a more moist but didn't compare to the taste of Country's in Columbus. If Jim is affiliated with this establishment, he would be ashamed. Also, the Mgr had fixed a plate for herself and sat and ate. Not once did she come over to ask about why we sent it back.  How convenient it would've been since we travel through Montgomery often and it's closer than Columbus for us.

We had approximately 125 guests in attendance, and we fit well in both the ceremony and reception areas. While the weather was sunny and hot, they cranked up the AC in the barn. Also, my granddaughter had fans printed up and passed out, so people were fanning themselves throughout the service in true Southern style. After the ceremony, we walked across the gravel road to the reception area, and dined under the wide open blue skies. Fireflies danced among the rose bushes as evening softly surrounded us, and the stars and twinkle lights added to our celebration. Of course, my granddaughter\u2019s father-daughter dance music selection was the opening theme song of the movie, \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d Then, the DJ put on the latest dance music, and the crowd of twenty-somethings danced the night away. The food and bar offerings were greedily devoured. I found the J and D staff kept our needs met unobtrusively but also with a sweet spirit. We just loved everything about this wedding, and it location was a large factor in our celebration.

It was very hot, though I obviously don't knock the location for that. My main complaint would be that they had to move the chairs from the ceremony area to the reception area. This took about 20 minutes, and left all the guests standing confused in heat. No one came to tell us when they were finished setting up, and we eventually meandered up to the barn where the reception was held. There were also quite a few chiggers (red bugs), at the barn as well. Perhaps this all wasn't to their fault and was resultant of poor planning, though it seemed as though it was.\n\nThe parking was also odd, it was about a quarter of a mile from the venue. They had transportation between places in the form of what was basically a golf cart. Though they took forever to come back and forth, resulting in my girlfriend walking up the hill in heels.\n\nOverall the place was quite beautiful, I hate to give this sort of review to such a lovely place, but this was my experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572798023395, "text": "Hi John,\nThanks so much for your review and the kind words about the overall beauty of our venue. In regards to the seating in the orchard... we actually have multiple seating options available that do not require seating to be moved from ceremony to the reception. We have over 300 chairs, vintage church pews as well as custom made wood benches. In this case it was requested that the same chairs be utilized at both, ceremony and reception, so we did in fact have to move them... which is a job that  requires about 20 minutes and 6 staff members. We do strongly discourage this option, but ultimately it\u2019s the decision of the bride. :-) As far as instructing guest to make their way to the barn, this would fall under the job of a wedding planner or coordinator, not the venue itself. In regards to chiggars, we do keep all gathering areas around the barn and reception area mowed and well maintained, however we do have 40 acres of Bermuda surrounding the barn, so if you got in any of these areas, a chigger or two is very likely :-). Finally, our parking lot is located on site but 600 feet from the barn. We do this as an effort to keep the ceremony & reception area safe, as well as clear of vehicles for photography purposes. A 6 seater electric (2017 Polaris Gem) shuttle is available for all weddings. The round trip for this takes only 90 seconds, of course that time does vary..  Especially when exiting, as we make every effort to drop guest directly at their car.  Again thank you for the very kind words. We hope you get the opportunity to attend another wedding soon!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888a30d338f76721:0xf2771ad745e07a53"}

We wanted to avoid the \"wedding nightmares\" you hear about with vendors falling through or ripping you off or all of the above and we chose wisely. We visited the venue and after meeting Yolanda, we immediately said \u201cthis is the one\u201d. We looked no further and this is the only venue we visited. It is as beautiful in person as you see in the many photos on their website and in other bride's pictures. I cannot wait to get our pictures/videos back. It is a family owned business and quite reasonable in the grand scheme of average wedding costs. We had unlimited contact and visits with all staff. We moved to the south a year before getting engaged and decided to have everyone come down to us for a good ol\u2019 southern wedding. The logistics were overwhelming and Yolanda, Candace and Terri were wonderful in making sure everyone was picked up, transported and generally accommodated. They take care of all the major details so for a detail-oriented person like me, it was great because I had time to craft my own little personal touches. We rented out the mansion for the immediate families and wedding party to spend the night with their guests and when we pulled up, we got nothing less than Ooos and Ahhs about how beautiful and serene it all is. Every vendor Yolanda has in her arsenal is remarkable and a joy to work with - she wouldn't have it any other way and that is how you know you're looking at the right venue/planner. The day-of coordinator (Terri) is a MUST-DO for Brides. We actually ate at our wedding! We had our first meal as husband and wife and no one even knew and just assumed the wedding norm ( that you don\u2019t get to eat the delicious food you hand-selected!) It was absolutely incredible. Everyone was so surprised that she answered all of their questions, let them do whatever they wanted within reason and even partied and had a blast with us. You will not find a more flexible venue/planner anywhere. There were bridesmaid's guests that were not a part of the wedding party and while we were off taking pictures or getting ready, she let them hang out, swim in the pool and generally do whatever as if they were at their own homes. In terms of the wedding, she was willing to go above and beyond to make the day special for us. She found us the perfect officiant who let us do a cultural element as part of our ceremony \u2013 something they were equally as excited to see executed. We wanted to light off lanterns at the end of the night and she said absolutely. Nothing was out of the realm of possibilities or \"against the rules\" and that is how your wedding day should be - exactly as you want. Everywhere else we looked there was a \u201cNo-no\u201d list of things you cannot do \u2013 be out by 11, no open flames, no loud music, etc etc. That list does not exist at Oak Island and they will try to accommodate all of your requests within reason.\n\nIf you are looking for a one of a kind wedding experience with seasoned professionals, listen to their advice (they've done way more weddings than you!) and go with Oak Island Weddings. We could not have been happier with our choice.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888948c6f31e0777:0x7dbfd474cbd2c867"}

This place looks and feels amazing. So to get to my experience we scheduled a King Pin Party Package here if you don't know what that is it's amazing what you get for you buck. We had an wonderful time bowling, great food and someone who actually knows how to make good mix drinks lol thanks bartenders. We want to get a BIG Shout Out to our lane server Michaela. She was on top of our party from start to finish never once did we have to search for her and very friendly A+++ service. Our second BIG Shout Out is to the Manager Lorenzo. We had a couple hiccups throughout the night nothing major but he was on top of it and made sure we had the best experience ever, we appreciate that man. Third an last shout out is to the man that set this all up for me over the phone Mr. John Cole. Without you and all your guidance and emails we would have never had this experience. Thanks again. If your looking for a good time and are over the age of 21 and wanna do a group event totally look into the King Pin Package here. I promise you that you won't regret the decision. Want to Thank the Bowlero of Columbus Ga for a great experience. Thank you all.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb6158566ef7:0x44ad879c3f9b25c8"}

My daughter and the birthday girl thought a better party would be held where there were more things than a slide. Surge and skyzone were both mentioned when the next has a party.

This is what I will review..\n\nUAB set up a vaccination site at the Hoover Met recently. It is an excellent choice of venue for giving drive-through vaccines. The large parking area is perfect for streaming through cars and lining up cars. It is off any major highway or heavily trafficked roadway. The UAB team have set up several pop-up pavilions wide enough to accommodate cars and UAB team members. The process is very simple and well-organized. I made my appointment through the UAB patient portal website. I noticed that the website made me a second appointment for my second vaccination 3 weeks after my first.  Very convenient. I arrived at my appointment time. There were people out directing traffic in the parking lot. At the first pavillion, a UAB team member gathered my name and appointment time, checked my ID, gave me a short form to fill-in and sign, then directed me to pull to the next pavilion, straight ahead. At the second pavilion, a UAB team member collected the form, gave the vaccination and immunization card and directed me to pull ahead to the waiting area. At the waiting area, a UAB team member greeted me, we conversed and they gave me instructions on how to alert them in case I had an adverse reaction to the shot. They made note of the time I received the vaccination and at what time the 15 minute wait period expired. During my wait, a UAB team member check on me verbally no less than 3x, other UAB team members would give me a nod or ask loudly to a group of cars how we were doing. The wait period flew by and I was on my way. From start to end the entire process took less than 45 minutes, probably around 30 minutes. I didn't time it. Overall, they were as well-organized as any Chick-fil-A drive-through and just as nice. Shout-out to the entire UAB team and any volunteers! Y'all Rocked It Out! Thank you for your hard work!

One vendor in a wheelchair was told that if they need to take food with their medicine every four hours it better be from the concession or they can \"wheel themselves out to the parking lot to eat with their pills\"\nSummary: your vendors will complain to you and their peers. This type of behavior is not practiced in successfully run venues.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921111e061de1:0xdd0f67408816698e"}

I never had to wait on a drink and he was polite and I could tell he knew what he was doing. He is the sole reason they even got 2 Stars. The food.....Oh the food. It was absolutely terrible. It was my wife's birthday and she really wanted to go here. It was my first time. I ordered some lobster tails she had the ultimate feast. When I got my food a $40 meal, my lobster was like a rubber band ball it was disgusting. I could barely rip it apart with my fingers. It could literally bounce. I had to cut it with a steak knife. I should have been fluffy, buttery and savory. I know it's not an ocean side restaurant but with a name like Red lobster I figured the lobster would be decent. I was so let down. Please make sure your cooks can at the most cook lobster. How is a place named Red Lobster serving such terribly cooked lobster. Your chef clearly doesn't belong at your store.  My in-laws ordered fish and chips. The fish had to have been dipped and breaded 15 times before it hit the fryer. When they finished they had almost an entire plate of batter that they picked and pealed off their fish. I was so embarrassed taking them here. My kids ordered the sirloin steak, they claimed to like it but they are kids, kids like anything. The steaks looked pretty beaten up and over cooked. Thank you Arthur for offering to replace the meal with a better cooked one,( \"which I turned down\" ) and thank you for being a fantastic server! I know that's a tough job. You were worth the $50 tip I left you. But Red Lobster I beg you to hire some efficient chefs and focus on training your cooks how to properly prepare lobster, steak and even a simple fish and chips. Find people who want to be there and who care weather their food is good. I'm not asking you to fire this person that cooked our food tonight but at the very least spend hours retraining them to cook your food the way it should be. I can't imagine how much money your company wastes throwing away food that was cooked terribly. I'm not sure I'll ever go to another Red lobster again which stinks because my wife raved about it, but it was just upsetting. I hope anyone who reads this doesn't have the same experience. I work too had for my $$$ to have someone not care how their food turns out. I don't blame red Lobster as I don't know their current situation but they have to know that their cook is not very good.

I was taken aback and perhaps this is on me for simply not getting up and walking out or bringing it up real time. This whole situation we all find ourselves in is awkward for all involved.  However, it is not on the customer's shoulders to enforce state rules. I just don't get it since it seemed most if not all of the other employees had appropriate facial covering.  Rationally I can tell myself that the exposure risk was probably low. On the other hand should I be having to go through that because a restaurant/employee couldn't be respectful of their customers?\n\nUpdate 3 weeks later:  Although I never received anything other than a canned response on Yelp in spite of contacting them via their website, I made a visit last night in hopes of finding improvement and dinning. Well, incredulously, it was worse!  The State's mask orders are still in effect. Opening the door and entering this time even the host doesn't have a mask and the first server we see - no mask. We turned and walked out.  You have to ask yourself what kind of corporate/management approach so blatantly violates an obvious and easily implementable order. And if they have this disregard about the things you can see then what about those things you can't even during non-pandemic times.\n\nThis can be done correctly.

Our food arrived and the steak was over done like shoe leather, the lobster tail was like eating a rubber band, and the side of fries was missing. The shrimp was at least alright. Our waitress was not seen again for 20+ minutes. She finally came back around, we mentioned some issues, and she vanished again. After several minutes, we caught some other waitress nearby and asked for a manager. After another 15+  minutes of no manager nor our waitress being seen, we left as we simply had no more time to waste dealing with this ordeal, we were already late at this point.

The Red Lobster there literally has the same qualities, defects, pros and cons as the one here in Huntsville, AL. Both lack in cleanliness. At peak hours the bathrooms become disgusting.

The food tastes like it came off an assembly line. I have no idea how people who\u2019ve had real seafood, down on the Gulf of Mexico, can stand to come home from vacation and eat this? There\u2019s nothing fresh about it. I have nothing negative to say regarding the staff. They seem like they work extremely hard. Sometimes it seems like they\u2019re just holding on. Much respect.

He said sorry and then said he was going to get her and our son a toy. He came back with a broken airplane that wouldn't stop beeping and two stuffed animals. It was just a weird experience and my daughter didn't want anything from him.

Are these toys from Red Lobster or did he bring them in himself? He was just a creepy guy who seemed like he had the maturity level of a 12 year old.

We ate here because we got a giftcard for Christmas and it turned out to be a big mistake. We ordered an appetizer, soup, salad, and dinner entree. Our appetizer came out and the waiter set it down on the table and quickly walked away as I was trying to tell him he didn't give us any plates or forks. So from the get go I was irritated. We tried to flag several people down and were ignored each time. So after getting no help we started eating our shrimp appetizer with our hands. Finally a different server helped us and got us some forks. But still no plates. Our appetizer was gone by the time our original waiter finally came back to the table and mumbled \"I shoulda been brought these out to ya\" at me and finally got us plates and biscuits. Then our dinner entrees were brought out by yet another different server. We tried to ask for our soup and salad but she turned and walked away so quickly I don't think she heard me. We had nearly finished our dinner entrees by the time our original server came to check on us, and instead of apologizing for the mistake just said \"yeah I know\" when I said we had ordered a soup and salad. If you know, then where is my food? We both finished our dinner entrees before he brought our soup and salad out and by that point we were already full. I paid $8 for a bowl of soup I didn't even eat.

He is 85 and a veteran from World War II, Vietnam, and Korea. He retired to   Huntsville almost 30 years ago. He has been going to the Red Lobster there for 30 years.  We had our meal and he insisted on paying the bill. He handed me his wallet which had 3 crisp 50 dollars bills inside. He asked to take two and put them in with the bill.... he wanted to pay the 47 dollar bill and get change to tip the waiter.  I removed the two bills and he ask that i lay them side by side in the envelope so that they did not get stuck together and so the waiter could see there were two and not just one. The lunch was slow taking almost two hours to complete so he finally asked if we could make our way to the car while my wife stayed and waited for the change.  i brought him to the car and we waited for another 20 minutes but my wife did not come.  Finally she did come out and was blown away.  The waiter came back by the table and through the plastic bill holder on the table and said there was no bill or money inside and that he was reprinting the bill for my wife to pay again. I went back into the restaurant to talk to the waiter, but he wouldn't even talk he left for a bit and the manager came out to talk to me. He said that i must have dropped the money and the bill and asked if it was in my pockets. I explained that I knew for sure the money was there because my dad had asked be to take the money from his wallet and to lay the bills next to each other so not to have a mis understanding and that i had closed the plastic envelope before is left and my wife had not even touched it.. only the waiter had touched it.  The manager did not seem to know what to do, but said if i left my number he would call if it turned up. It was a bad situation for everyone. The lady;s sitting across from us leaned over to my wife and said ' we saw you pay the bill\"...  I finally decided that having my dad at the restaurant for 2 and a half hours was too long for him to be up so I just told them to keep our money and i left.  I guess i was hoping that the manager would say here is your 40 dollars change you asked for and we will find this mis-placed bill and work it out... i understand it is a bad situation but my dad now will never go back after 30 years and is telling everyone he sees about the lost of  his money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

The service was very poor (despite not being particularly busy, in the ~2 hours of our being there, the server only voluntarily visited our table 3-4 times).\n\nAs for the meal itself, the iced tea I was served tasted funny. The dish I ordered had a choice of New York Strip or Filet Mignon and, despite not indicating a preference, the server never asked me which I\u2019d like. The Caesar salad had maybe 3-5 shavings of parmesan on it and the lettuce was rather limp and not crisp. The shrimp scampi was fine; it tasted of garlic and not much else. The wood-grilled shrimp was meh; it was lackluster in terms of flavor, due in part to its complete lack of seasoning. In general everything was pretty bland.The \u201csteamed\u201d broccoli was instead maybe half-steamed, i.e. it was half-raw, therefore rather crunchy. And even the ~$11 Lobster Tail was over-cooked, dry, and bland (also it wasn\u2019t served with butter).\n\nBased on this experience, I would recommend going to a different location or, if you find that the quality does not improve elsewhere, pick a different restaurant altogether. 3/10.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

There weren't that many people there. Stopped at the hostess stand and she was on the phone talking to someone about a lost article. No big deal so we waited several minutes while she finished her phone conversation. There was also a male employee who was stacking menus who just ignored us. The female hostess gets off the phone and seats us. We look through the menu and make our selections. I realized that we still had not even been greeted even though 3 other tables had been seated after us and were approached by their waiters and were given drinks and biscuits. Still no waiter even though there were two waiters standing by our booth right behind my husband. Our booth was at the end so they were just a couple of feet from us and I am sure that they could hear our conversation wondering why we didn't have a waiter. At that point I pulled out my cellphone to keep track of the time. We had been sitting there for almost fifteen minutes when a female waiter passed us and said our waiter would be there in just a minute. A few minutes more went by before a female waiter who had an order of food to deliver paused at our table and asked if we knew what we wanted to drink. I told her that we had been sitting there for quite some time and already knew what we wanted to order to eat. She said okay that she would be right back and would take good care of us. I saw her deliver the food and then go to another table to take their order. My husband and I just looked at each other and got up and left. I can't believe that there were waiters standing around and nobody had waited on us in all that time. It was inexcusable and I will be sure to let everyone we know what poor service we were given. I could understand if it was busy, but there weren't many tables occupied.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

This time, Niadja, our waitress was caring; but she gave us dinner pricing when our visit was at lunchtime. Is it legal to charge dinner prices at lunch claiming that the sizes are larger without notice or consent from the customer? We never got the towelettes we requested until the end, either.  In Japan, for instance, a nice hot cloth towel is afforded to the patrons prior to eating. On the same note, Japanese peeps don\u2019t wear shoes indoors either so why would we expect for an American restaurant to provide us hand wipes prior to eating? Our seats were too close together, so we moved. But, the table we moved to wobbled and caused damages to us as well as to our belongings. Thomas, the manager was rude and indifferent. Niadja was to apply a $4.00 coupon which led to our finding out about the pricing deceit. Our hot-spot was being used; but Thomas wouldn't let us use their DSL to get the $4.00 coupon from our Trash. Thank GOD $4.00 won't break us since GOD has given us so much. It's the principal of the matter, though. On our visit previously, a man came in seeking stuff and it was not until he started to bother other guests did management ask him to leave. Plus $1000 was stolen from an acquaintance of ours from her purse while she and her friends were eating there a while ago. On second thought, the people there are very unhappy, the waitresses never smile and purposely catch your eye only to give you a mean look.

(Babalu, anyone?)\nAs a wedding vendor myself, I can say that the venue offers a great value for the space, and it's the perfect place to flip from ceremony to reception or even segment off into 2 areas with the built-in stage for the reception space.\nPlus, the ladies who manage the venue, Courtney and Julie and their team, are wonderful people who really are a joy to work with. They're knowledgable and experienced in the wedding field, they make events seamless, and as I've worked with them before, I've watched them take care of and serve their clients so well.

The young man who is currently serving as camp host was very pleasant and accommodating. However, upon our arrival, it wasn't very clear how to actually check-in. It was mid-afternoon on a Friday and the onsite General Store was closed. There was a sign on the door with a phone number so I called that and we were told to find a site and the camp host would arrive shortly. We stayed in the tent camping section for 3 nights, total cost was $66. Unfortunately the nearest outhouse was quite a walk from our site and we were only about halfway back into the camping area. I've been camping for 34 years and I don't think I have ever had to walk that far to use a bathroom. We had to drive to the bathhouse for showers because it's even farther than the outhouses and it's partway down a 25 mph road without sidewalks. While the bathhouse was pretty clean, the mini trash cans were not emptied the entire time we were there and with only one shower in each of the men/women's bathrooms, we often had to wait in lines with 2 or 3 people ahead of us. There's a great boat launch which was being utilized for a fishing tournament qualifying event the weekend we stayed so there was a ton of trucks/trailers coming and going and when we left in our car for a trip to town, we were blocked into the tent area by trucks lined up to pull their boats out of the water. There are signs posted not to block the road, and I realize how difficult it would be to enforce it, but I would recommend anyone planning to stay to check if similar events might be held and avoid the park at those times. Also, for some strange reason the tent area road was blocked off in several places by rope so we had to kind of forge our own way in some places which concerned me since I don't have a 4-wheel drive vehicle.  I think overall it's a really great campground, we felt isolated from other campers and our site was beautifully situated in the shade on a bluff above Tensaw River. The bugs were kind of bad but that was expected, we were prepared with bug spray. We also kept a smoky fire burning which helped.  I would love to see an outhouse placed in the middle of the tent area since the closest one was at the boat launch. I also recommend adding a map of the grounds to your website. We'd stay here again if there was an outhouse added to the tent area; otherwise, we probably won't come back which sucks because it's really beautiful. We really did enjoy ourselves, though.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611860781770, "text": "Thank you !"}, "gmap_id": "0x889af4bcafb9bedf:0x6ae3d9a300153c16"}
