I made my choice, I executed my rights. You cannot shame me for that.  The clinic has escorts posted outside each time the protesters show up, and they are very kind and understanding people who guide you to and from your vehicles - you can identify them by their rainbow vests.  They do everything to make sure you feel safe and comfortable, even from the first steps into the parking lot.\n\nYou do not hear any screams in the clinic. They do not pull anything away from you or out of you. That is gross misinformation. The nurses are very clear on procedures, and you have options with them. They are kind, compassionate, and will explain things as deeply as you need them to be explained.\n\nThe doctor worked quickly and made me as comfortable as possible.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making the choice to have an abortion. God doesn't love you any less than he did the day before. If any self-respecting Christian tries to preach to you otherwise, know that they speak only false verse. God is forgiving.

The pain was so much worse than expected that I thought something was wrong and was worried and considered to call someone to take me to the hospital. I didn\u2019t, I called the on-call number and the doctor told me to just go lie down on a heating pad and try and take a nap and that it would pass. I told her that I was in the worst pain and was struggling to even get my words out to her and that I couldn\u2019t walk for the pain. I was screaming in pain. She said that there was no need to go to an ER that they would just tell me the same thing and by the time I would be seen it would all be over. And I explained to her that I understood that it would be painful but it didn\u2019t feel right and she reiterated the above. I gave up and she could tell I guess I became distant and said that if I was worried enough and after a while if it were still bad and I insisted on being seen to just come to the clinic. I opted out due to how rude she was to me. She made me feel so small and unimportant. It went on for 8 hours in that severity. The heating pad provided no relief . I was taking both Tylenol and ibuprofen alternating safely and there was no relief. I felt everything. It was so bad I vowed I would never do it again. At my checkup the ultrasound was clear. Here I am 3 months later having complications due to retained product of conception. It was an incomplete abortion. I am now going to have to have a D&C. I spent all day in the ER yesterday due to passing large clots, heavy bleeding, and abdominal pain. I am mortified. I am so sad to have to go through another round of this.\nI wish when it was hurting so bad I would have went to the hospital and not have cared about what she said; That there would be a lack of compassion because this was a voluntary termination and I would not be seen as urgent. I tried to tell her over and Over again that I was worried and she basically, professionally told me I was being dramatic in the most condescending way possible.

The staff makes sure you\u2019re informed. The facility is safe with all doors remaining locked unless otherwise buzzed in. The front desk lady was very quick and maintained an incredibly quiet voice so that no one else could hear the needs of the visit, payment, expectations, etc. The whole visit was very time efficient, especially considering I went at lunch time. The staff made sure to be very up front and informative, non judgemental and never once asked why I was making the choice I was. They made distracting small talk which lightens the very heavy and awkward mood. I would recommend this facility to any fellow lady that feels like this is her answer. Thank you to all of the ladies that work here.
