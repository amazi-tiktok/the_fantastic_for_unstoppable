I tried to piddle with it but decided that I needed to let an expert handle it since water had gotten in the motor. I had some bad luck with previous PWC mechanics in the area so I was apprehensive. Fred at Advanced Watercraft took it in and diagnosed several issues. It was back running in a week. Me and my kids took it out the day we picked it up and by the end of the day it had taken on water again. WAIT! I know it sounds like they didn't fix it, but I took it back to Fred and AW- he was apologetic and accommodating. Turns out in addition to the items he had fixed, a previous mechanic had routed some water lines incorrectly and caused an additional water issue. Although it was not his fault, Fred insisted that he would fix the boat and he did it at no charge. This type of commitment to service is rare these days.

Nick Morris was the first person to approach us and we were more than impressed with his easy, friendly demeanor and willingness to explore our wants in a new boat.  He spent time with us, but also gave us space to look around and gather thoughts.  That casual attitude of salesmanship is quite rare.  He knew tons of details about the Supra. Chad and the other guys were also so friendly & helpful with boat and purchase details. We understood immediately that we were buying a choice in a boat dealer and felt extremely comfortable that Skiers Marine was the number one choice.\n\nThis was a large purchase and we did not take it lightly, but the Supra quality coupled with Skiers Marine quality and reputation made this new boat purchase an easy decision.\n\nThank you for being at the boat show and all of the awesome incentives.

No pressure to buy and he let our 3 little kids climb all over his super nice boats without shedding one tear- while we deliberated over which boat to get.  After several weeks and my slow decision making process -  He drove to pick up the boat - drove to our lake to deliver it and then rode around with us for over 3 hours making sure we were comfortable. I think we had to kick him out of the boat bc we knew that he had an hour and a half drive back home.\nAbsolutely happy!

Kit Barnes was, by far, the best sales person that I have every worked with.  After 20 years of experience with I/Os and a desire to wake surf, we decided to look into purchasing an inboard/tow boat.  Our requirements were unique, in that we wanted a tow boat that was in the 25 foot length, had a large open bow area and yet could also provide a decent wave for surfing.  During my research, it seemed that a Mastercraft X55 was about the only boat that could potentially meet our needs.  I found a few X55\u2019s of interest on Boattrader, sent inquiries out, and Kit was the first to respond (within a day or two).  He later followed up with a phone call to better understand our situation and he even offered advice on different models and brands.  I was very impressed that he expressed interest in helping us find a boat that best matched our needs and really gave me a crash course on the different models of inboards.  The biggest thing is that he really worked with us on the X55, since I knew that we had to stay in a larger model to meet our family\u2019s requirements.  Kit was the only person that was willing to work with us to see if we could configure the X55 to produce a nice wake for surfing.  The test drive went great and with a few adjustments, Kit had the boat configured to make a nice wake for surfing.\n\nWe really appreciate the time that Kit spent with us in answering all of our questions and educating us on the Mastercraft X55.  We proceeded to purchase the boat and are also very happy with the ongoing support and service that Skier\u2019s Marine provides to us.

Since we had never owned a boat before, we were very apprehensive and nervous about this process. We met with multiple dealers to get a feel for what we wanted and what we could afford. Skiers Marine provided us first class customer service and was by and far the most knowledgeable and down to earth. The owner, Rhett went above and beyond anything we would ask for in this process. For instance, he brought the boat from Birmingham to our friend's neighborhood on Lake Martin so that we could demo it. He spent a couple of hours with me, my wife, and my three little boys demonstrating the boat. Once we decided that we wanted the boat, the purchase process was straight forward and simple. We live in Northern Atlanta. I expected to take a day off of work to drive to Birmingham and pick up the boat. When the boat was prepared and detailed, Rhett called and let me know the day that HE could deliver it! Rhett drove to Atlanta, delivered the boat, and taught me how to put the boat in and out of the water. Yesterday, I arrived home to a package from Skiiers marine. I opened up the box and found two life jackets! Thank you Rhett and Skiiersmarine for taking care of us through this process. If you are buying a boat for the first time (or 2nd or 3rd time), I would highly recommend Rhett and Skiers marine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889419875558687:0x71119d6c950af788"}

Matter of fact the 4 bolts that attach the carburetor were barely  finger tight causing fuel to leak into my air filter chamber. I came home and took it back for another 6 to 8 weeks and had to go sit in the waiting room to have someone actually work on my unit.   A week later after finally picking up my Rancher it wouldn\u2019t crank. A friend told me about Powersports Service Center and  Chuck and the team were amazing. My unit was fixed in three days and the real problem was found and corrected immediately. My Rancher runs perfectly now cranking with the slightest touch of the starter.

He said he is backed up and it would really help him out a lot if I could bring it by that Tuesday, I told him that sounds great. He asked that I send him my address and the issues via text before hand. I did. I had to work late and had my cousin drop it off. Please see the photos of our texts. I told him a million times DO NOT BUY ANYTHING for the RV I ONLY want a diagnosis. He took a week, and ended up purchasing: -LP for the RV, Checking the outside, HE BROKE the generator and told me that it stopped working. He even said on audio, it was working when you dropped it off. HE broke the battery disconnect again which was working when I dropped it off. When I went to pick it up he kept repeating how he put me in front of other projects and he needs more time. I explained how he told  me to bring it in on that day because he was behind the previous week.

I sent in a request a request on 5/19/18 to Daivd at outboard repair and salvage for him to honor a receipt for a 200 hp Mercury outboard motor. I had problems with it from day one.  They kept it for over a month and still wasn't fixed. I took it to Steel Creek Marine who is a certified Mercury outboard repair dealer.   They told me that it was not a 200 hp motor but a 150 hp. Big difference.  THAT'S FRAUD. He also said it had major problems and need to be rebuilt.  I have a written statement of the inspection.  So I spoke to David of Outboard Repair and Salvage.  He stated he would replace it.  I dropped of my boat to get the new motor exchanged.   I asked him to please have it fixed by the end of the week.  I called on that Friday and he said he was looking for one.  Then I called several times to see if the boat was ready but I got no answer.  I finally got someone to pic up on Friday 6/30/18. TWO WEEKS LATER!! They said David would have to call me back. He called back and left 2 messages. 1 saying he was still looking for a motor. Another saying that he found one and would have it ready by Monday which was 7/2. I have the recorded messages.  I called to check on it and the secretary now says it will be another week.  Unfortunately I have waited and waited and waited.  ITS NOW 7/21.  There seemes no concern in fixing this problem in a timely manner. I have lost time, money, vacation waiting for this problem to be corrected. I have missed 2 fishing rodeos that tickets were naught for including the Dauphin Island Deep Sea Fishing Rodeo. I have paid for not just tickets for the event but also for my brother I have not seen in 3 years way to get here to fish with him and my dad.

The pool was added but like every downside I\u2019m going to mention, you have to pay to get your key pass and be sure not to loose it! The rent is supposed to be set but you\u2019re always charged extra ALWAYS. I ended up paying 100 more every month because I went over my electricity supposedly. Other then paying more every month I\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t a bad stay the management is friendly for the most part I never had any issues with them. The spots are extremely tight and you can pretty much hear everything your neighbor is doing. There are loud noises from the plants around the park especially on the weekends.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572537813755, "text": "Thank you, Ruben, for your reply.  It allows us to provide information to future guests.   I'd like to respond to your \"downsides\".\n\nYes, we collect a $20 deposit on the \"key pass\" to the pool, which is similar to a hotel key to provide safe passageway into the pool for authorized users.  What you failed to mention is that you get that $20 back when you return the key, so you're not out any money.\n\nSecondly, the sites are metered, and tenants are charged .16/kWh for power usage, and one is invoiced anything usage over the $50 allowance.  Anyone is welcomed to monitor their usage by taking note of the meter reading.  It's certainly unfair for a 22' unit to have to pay a higher rent to cover the usage of a 42' unit which has 2 or 3 air conditioner units, therefore, we keep all things even by giving each monthly guest a $50 allowance toward their power.  How they use it is up to the tenant.  You were also here during the summer months when temperatures were extremely high and often record-setting, so yes, you would more than likely have a higher power usage to keep the camper cool.\n\nThirdly, the site you were on is one of our smaller and cheaper sites.  We have larger sites as well.\n\nLastly, we are located next to a scrap yard, and they do move scrap around 6 days a week.  Their weekend noise is no different than during the week.  You must have just been off on the weekends to hear it.\n\nAnd yes, we're continuing to make improvements on the property, including the addition of 21 more sites so we may welcome more guests!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886285bb06e87b7f:0x94a3d5c4ffaec253"}

So i was told in order to replace the freeze plug the motor had to come out of the boat. After pulling the motor and replacing the freeze plug he said he would then put it back together and take the boat and run it at shop to make sure it didnt run hot and if i didnt he would then take it to the river and run it hard to make sure it still didnt run hot. This exact deal was made for a total of $900. I agreed to this. However, he didnt take the motor out for some reason he took the out board off and didnt replace the freeze plug. And said as is i owed him the $900. And he wasnt putting it back together. This has been over 5 months ago. Just for a freeze plug plu. After heated discussions he agreed to put my boat back together and call me when it was finished. I have called mulitple times to only be put on hold and never have they answered after putting me on hold. I feel as though i have no other choice but to pursue this matter legally.

Gee, after experiencing last year's customer service, we asked that they either give absolute guarantee of repair time or preferably that they come over to Perdido Key to repair at our marina slip.\n\nNo, they couldn't give a guarantee and they no longer provide service to Perdido Key!  This answer was less than 4 weeks ago..... and today they are servicing a boat on our dock!\n\nWill never use them and definitely not refer them to anyone!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1470245114797, "text": "Dee, we regret to find out that you had such a bad experience with us.

So many times other places misdiagnosed an issue, or recommended unnecessary repairs, and P & D always gets it right, and gets it fixed the first time.  They are also very quick with repairs, and communicate exactly what is going on.  It is also convenient to the major boat launches in Orange Beach, so you simply drop the boat off with them, even after hours, and they take care of things on the next business day.  Their prices are reasonable for the speed of turnaround, and quality of work product.  I firmly believe too that they are incredibly honest and fair with everything they do.  I highly recommend them for your boat servicing needs. - James Dorgan, Attorney at Law, Fairhope, Alabama", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570801840031, "text": "Mr. Dorgan, it was a pleasure working for you.
