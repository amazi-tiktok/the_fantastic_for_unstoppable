But after leaving their employ, the bank sold out to a larger bank- twice -  and we felt like a \"number\". We were recommended to talk to Bryant and when we did it was like meeting family! Natalie Norton and her excellent group of ladies just make us feel SO welcome EVERY time we go. They know us by name and go out of their way to greet us with smiles and serve us so splendidly. We wouldn't dream of going elsewhere for banking services. We are spoiled !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1497640744618, "text": "We are so glad that you love Bryant Bank and have experienced our unbeatable customer service.
