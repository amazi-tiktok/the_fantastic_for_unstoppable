I went back and what should have been a calm discussion about getting the right battery turned into a very heated exchange when the dealer began to call my mother rude and claiming the battery was fine.\n\nThe battery ( the 12 V startup one) is a specialty type of battery for a hybrid that only the dealer provides and costs about 500$:\n\nWe ended up getting a check from them to get the battery from the dealer (they wouldn\u2019t pay the install price, just the wholesale). The thing is, is that this review would have been 5 stars if they had just been polite and understating when we came to them about the problem. We could have gotten to the same point without the very unpleasant arguing and lying. That had us coming away with what seems to be a great car but a really bad taste in our mouth about the dealer.\n\nHope the car runs for a long time, but when buying a car from here ....

Great, genuine people here. Drove an hour and a half to the location, test drove the 2014 Nissan and took it to get checked out at a near by garage. It checked out- As any used car it had minor things that needed to be addressed but that's to be expected with any used car. I don't expect a brand new car, besides a mechanic shop HAS to give you a long list otherwise they feel like they have not done their job correctly. Came back, negotiated price (which was already low and I admit to that since I did my research). The gentleman was polite and told me he could knock of $200. Paid it in cash and made it through the paperwork hassle free in less than 15 minutes. On the way out I ran into  the owner who  explained to me the way that they conducted their business. They seemed to do well and sold many cars at that location. He was a very down to earth person. The reason for my detailed explanation is to make it clear to anyone that looks at online reviews to take them for a grain of salt. Mid-conversation with the owner I watched a man come into this dealership and demand new brakes and tires on a vehicle he bought a few weeks back apparently, and otherwise threatened to leave a bad review!! People like that get on my last nerve. These folks are selling good quality cars for a fraction of the price. If someone wants a brand new car they need to help themselves to a brand new car store. We don't see shops like this anymore, everything is being bought out and turned into a franchise sore where you would pay at a lot more for the exact same car. We need to value these people.

If I could leave 0 stars, I would.\n\nMy mother purchased a car a few weeks ago and today she decided to go on her lunch break and get her tag. Information that should've been provided during her purchase at the dealership was requested from the clerk at the tag/title office. She placed a call and got the owner on the phone and he was attemping to assist her. While he was able to eventually get her the information she needed the process of how she had to get the information from the owner was where she had an issue. She stated that there was a language barrier which she didn't personally mind BUT as she was on her lunch break and had limited time to talk she requested to speak with someone with better English that could accomodate her and articulate the information she needed in a timely manner. The owner became rude with her during her phonecall even prompting the clerk at the window to comment on his rudeness.\n\nI later accompanied her to his dealership as she needed to make a payment on her vehicle as well. Once arriving conveniently the owner was sitting on the front \"porch\" of the lot. When she expressed to him her issue with the process that it took to get information from him earlier and why she requested to speak with someone with better English he became rude with her again, and constantly interrupted her.  I happened to accompany her on this visit and made a comment about his direct rudeness. I guess he didn't take our visit too well because we'd interrupted his flirting with his employee but he then proceeded to invite the both of us into his office and present to us a dusty old box containing his many \"degrees\" which from what I saw were merely laminated certificates as if that gave him the right to conduct business and talk to us the way he did. I made the comment that both myself and my mother carried actual degrees from accredited universities, she even having her Masters which at the end of the day should not matter. Him having the title of \"OWNER\" and his many \"degrees\" should never give him the right to believe that he should be able to be rude to customers or anyone else for that matter. It takes way more than walking around and merely calling yourself a business owner. Its a matter of action as well. As an owner you should be able to take criticism and responsibility for your actions. A simple apology would've been good enough but my mother didn't even get that. I myself began to get upset because of the way he chose to speak to my mother. I simply could not allow it. I began to explain her position yet he attempted ot interrupt me like he did her. I wasn't allowing that either. Our conversation ended up being a mix of words in which he eventually summoned one of his employees into the room for reasons I still don't know. She attempted to explain that the owner was alone by himself at 8 AM until she was able to get into the office and the fact that she hadn't been able to hang up her purse because he asked her to take the phone. This made no difference to me or my mother because 1. She called around 1 PM not 8 AM & 2. As a business \"OWNER\" he should've done a better job with tailoring his business to order to fit the needs of customers. If you had staffing issues then as an \"OWNER\" it was on him to take on that matter himself. Either way it should not fall on the shoulders of the customer to deal with your rudeness and lack of customer service. My mother always raised me to be honest and to speak my mind so here I am speaking my mind and saying that the \"OWNER\" of this establishment is trash and should better spend his days gaining proper accreditation on what it means to be a good business owner and how to deliver good customer service as well taking some time to fix up his dealership because all it takes is for the wrong person to have an accident on that janky \"staircase\" on his lot and his entire business under fire due to lawsuit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923b189b005c9:0x6db750ee718606e9"}

I bought a truck from them at an outrageous price (had no options at the time and needed a truck A.S.A.P. for business) and I have spent over $5,000 fixing it in the 6 months I've owned it. I was told by Lee and the \"salesman\" that the truck was $11,000, only to charge me $13,000. Of course once I realized what they did and contacted them they play dumb and it is too late. I know if I should have taken more time to review and ask questions but it was the end of the day, past business hours already and I needed to leave with the truck that day. Regardless you should never practice those business ethics in any industry. I have had to change the rotors, brakes, brake drums, brake cylinder, master cylinder, calipers and brackets, hub assembly, CV axles, steering arm, I am in the process of changing the transfer case (over $2,000 on it's own) and it still needs a steering column, gear box, front differential, driveshaft and possibly the rear differential. When it's all said and done I will have put at least 5 times the value of this truck into making it run right and paying it off. I am a self employed remodeler and I have missed countless days of work, lost countless jobs and it's gotten to the point that I am having trouble paying for my daughters daycare and buying her essentials.

I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people. These people are clearly slimy and cannot be trusted, save yourself the hassle and do not purchase a vehicle from here. Learn from my mistake, don't come here. Where ever you do go, whatever you are offered make sure it is in writing!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4dad79f7ce2f:0x315d0851bfaa041e"}
