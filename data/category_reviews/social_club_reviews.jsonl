The gentleman behind the counter walked me thru a selection of starter pipes, what to look for when purchasing a pipe and what they offered for my future needs. In fact, he was so helpful and informative that after talking to him for a little while it dawned on me that I had been burned (no pun intended) by the shop where I made my initial purchase. It may have beeen textbook salesmanship, I don't know but I ended up buying a new pipe with accessories and he threw in a bag of tobacco of my choice and a cool little box to store it in for free. All of that, and I still came out much cheaper with a better quality pipe than I purchased just the day before. Not only was the staff friendly but the customers who were there, all of which the salesman new by name, drew me in and not only helped me pick out a good starter tobacco but showed me how to pack it correctly and gave me a bag or two of their own to try.
