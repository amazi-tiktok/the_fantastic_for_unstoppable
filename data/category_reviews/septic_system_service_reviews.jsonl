Which was a problem for some. But not for Jamie, he quickly uncovered the lid with his mini Digger. And got to work with quality equipment. He paid attention to every detail of my tank and saw I had a a slight problem a plastic baffle piece and fixed it and also applied a new filter too.\nThe clean up of the yard was also great too. He made sure all dirt was back to ground level smooth.\nI would highly recommend this company again and he and my family will continue you use him until he quits the business.\nThis company is not out just to suck your tank out and leave.

I was simply amazed by his prices. This was about a year ago so I'm going off of memory.. about $700/$750(mind you, everybody else wanted $2,000!!!). My septic tank is not a usual septic tank. It goes a bit deeper then what it should. Therefore I should be charged more! He did a great job! When he got done he realize that my pipes were clogged. He recommended me to someone that got the job done very quickly. Mr. Caples told me that if I had any more issues that it had to be my field lines. Nine months later I had water in my basement and I reached out to him again. Without missing a beat he knew exactly who I was and set up an appointment with me. He came out and fix the problem. Now we're six months in and everything is working great. I appreciate the way that Mr. Cappels handled my situation. Instead of charging me an arm and a leg to replace everything all at once he pumped by septic tank first and then we waited to see if that was it or if more needed to be done.

He immediately diagnosed the problem, which was the job done by Weaver. They had not sealed the caps to the tank or bolted them down, but only placed it down and covered it with dirt. This was allowing water to flood our tank every time it rained. Trey from Ultimate was able to replace caps and properly seal them and also fix an issue with the pipe leading to the tank.

While he cannot help that he encountered a mess and that it was me who invited him to out my appointment off til later, I never heard back from him as promised. When I reached out to their office receptionist/customer service specialist, they apologized but did not offer me a \"make-up\" appointment. Rather, they indicated they were scheduling people (customers calling after my missed appointment) already into the following Tuesday and it would be after that date. They told me they had been scheduling others since my appointment and it would be 2-3 days before they could work me back in. I would rather bail buckets of water to my back porch for the rest of the week than do business with a company that accepts this as customer service. Thus, I cancelled my interest in following through with the repairs. There was also an issue with price discrepancy. The web listed free estimates. It seemed reasonable however they would charge $60.00 to come from the Gadsden to Leeds area but the technician indicated it would be $89.00. He did offer to honor the price but it was dishonored by not showing up or calling. It is of course unclear if this was the intent. I will say they were all very nice if you just want to talk to nice and seemingly knowledgeable people about plumbing.\n\nAddendum: \"I see that a reply has been offered by the owner, \"I'm sorry, call and we will make it right\" Before spending more time talking about the idea of services, I would need to know how this would be made right. For instance, if I have received the repairs elsewhere (since this was well over a month ago), will I receive some reimbursement for such? I cannot imagine someone being so generous as to do such a thing.\nOr if I have not had the repairs done, will I receive an offer no one could possibly refuse in exchange for the prior bad service. Maybe if I have an idea about whether the call is worthwhile vs a pre-scripted customer service response, I might call.

Our yard was left a mess by Absolute as we we had an understanding they'd be back to finish the job. My husband called them on Friday, March 12 and left a message for a return call and again on Monday, March 15th. Today is March 20th. We have yet to hear from them. We didnt foresee contacting them and getting them out here would be a problem. We needed our lines cleared asap as they were backed up. They didnt step up.  They clearly showed bad business ethic!!\nAt the end of the business day on Monday, March 15th, we decided to contact a different company. We're very happy with our experience with the other company we went with. We got a call back from them in less than an hour. We had our first issue resolved in less than 24 hours.

I tried to get a refund from Bo and he denied my request saying that there was no refunds. The point is he tried to sell me a new septic tank without me needing one. Now I am still out $3500 because he would not give me a refund. I have the letter from the inspector telling me what to do to pass the inspection. I had new cover put on it by a different contractor that she recommended and she came back out and checked it.

Because of problems with sellers and inspector dragging feet it was not possible.   Bo agreed to still get it done after signing as long as it was payed upfront by sellers.  After talking to Bo personally I realized that he was a man made of integrity.    Because of weather and other issues getting it done as quick as originally agreed on was not possible. It was starting to worry me if it would be done at all.   Bo however did come out personally as promised and went above and beyond to take care of our problem.  So as far as being skeptical about him and his company because of other reviews, don\u2019t. He is a man of his word that takes pride in his work.  He won\u2019t break rules or cut corners. He believes in exceptional work and expects nothing less than that from his employees.   I saw where people said he was rude and had a temper.  I disagree.  All he ask is you show him respect for what he does and he will show you the same.   He is a very nice person as long as you take a second and realize you chose him for his expertise not the other way around(or you would be doing the job yourself).  I knew nothing about septic systems before today as this was my first house with it and Bo and his staff took plenty of time to explain in great, yet simple and easy terminology, about how it works and what to expect.

He stayed out there with his HEAD down in your tank trying to help you out.

You talked to him the next day and he told you that he would come back out there and finish pumping the tank if you got it all uncovered and bring you another concrete lid with no charge.

Exceptionally professional and personable crew.  I am a first time homeowner and have never experienced the problems a septic system may cause.  Ignorance in the matter led me to believe that they needed servicing far more infrequently than they do.  Needless to say it was not only full, but compacted and beginning to fill into my mainline.  Also, my septic tank was positioned awkwardly between my package air unit and a shed, both of which were there when I purchased the home.  Every problem that arose was met and resolved with diligence and care.  I had my tank pumped, a new lid with a cap installed which allows easier and cheaper future maintenance (recommended), and also had to have my mainline pressure washed to remove blockages.  Each service offered was fairly priced and alternatives given, such as renting a snake and snaking the blockage out myself.  I'm glad I opted to have it pressure washed out because I don't think I would have been able to dislodge it myself.  I appreciate direct people that do no try to \"upsale\" at every corner.   I was shown my problems and given options on how to resolve them and informed on the pros and cons of each which allowed me to decide what I thought best for me.  Most importantly, I would like to inform home owners to spare them any problems that may be looming ahead of them.  What would typically be a 20 min job ended up being multiple hours do to the condition and location of my septic tank and also why I recommend the capped lid.  Next time it needs to be pumped all that will be needed is removal of the lid and send the hose down without having to dig into my yard which will make it significantly cheaper going forward.   Also, instead of 7 years going without service it will be done at the recommended 3.  If you have a septic tank and it hasn't been serviced in 3 years,  get it done.  Trust me, it will save you money and headaches.  Due to my experience with Drainworks I will be a customer of theirs going forward.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1524149919387, "text": "Mr. Horst, thank you so much for taking the time to write your review.

They quoted me the price before even diagnosing the issue, stating, \"we can make this stop dripping for $175\". It was a 20 minute repair job and it did not solve the problem - still leaked. I requested them to come back because it wasn't fixed and all they did was the exact same repair. This did nothing, and the faucet still leaks to this day. The plumbers were not professional, did not wear masks, and did not want to take the time to accurately diagnose and fix the issue. Instead, they looked for the easiest and quickest \"fix\".  I ended up having to call another plumber who was able to correctly diagnose and explain the problem to me. I might as well have thrown $225 in the trash.\n\nNot only did the plumber waste my money, but cost me HUNDREDS. During my initial request for service, I also requested that they re-install a center knob on a shower spa sprayer that came loose. It was installed a few years ago, and nothing technically was wrong with it - the center knob just needed to be re-installed. After taking apart the cover plate and fooling with it, they said it couldn't be fixed. They never diagnosed the issue or told me what was wrong with it, offering no solution. I hired a different plumber to look at it today and he said that the metal lip on the center valve is chipped and broken from someone trying to turn it excessively to remove it (it is one piece and can't be removed). It was installed a few years ago, and no one else has fooled with it except for them. So, they chipped it when fooling with it, which explains their reluctance to fix the problem. Now the entire unit has to be replaced, I have to cut a hole in my wall, and it is going to cost me hundreds of dollars. An honest or reliable plumber would have owned up to the mistake instead of trying to brush it off, and a knowledgeable one would have known better to begin with.\n\nI honestly never leave bad reviews.

When our septic field failed less that 5 years after it was installed, we called to see if they would come fix it. They said it wasn't under warranty and would not help us at all.  We knew it wasn't under warranty but the county septic engineer said we should contact them to come fix their work because they put it in they are familiar with it. They they asked where it was leaking,  and said if it was off the side it was our fault, (note I wasn't trying to place blame, I was trying to get help) The leak is on the top, close to where the main pipe should connect into the dome system.  I was then told I would save a LOT of money if we just had a load of land fill and put it on top, and that would \"fix\" the problem. I told that to the county engineer, and was informed that would be illegal, and just cause more problems, and we would be liable for an Illegal fix, for several reasons, 1- we are not licensed or certified to work on a septic field, even though it is our own. 2- we would not have pulled a permit for the fix, which if we ever sold the house and they found out about the fix we would be liable.
