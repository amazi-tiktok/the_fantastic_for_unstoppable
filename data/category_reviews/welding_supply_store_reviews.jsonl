Whether you're a professional spending thousands of dollars on the best equipment money can buy for your livelihood or just a hobbyist like myself. Proudly sticking metal together, making bad welds and thinking to yourself the whole time that you're going to be the next Wayne Gretzky of welding when in turn you're actually the Helen Keller of welding but that's neither here nor there. The guys at Wesco will do their best to help us Gretzky's do the best we can do in order to achieve a welding hobby on a budget. Personally I will not buy any of my welding products anywhere else due to the fact when I walk out of there I know and understand what I spent the money on and have the confidence knowing that it's going to do the right job for me. Sure I could probably get it a little bit cheaper right down the street but I'm going to get an inferior product sold to me by a person who probably knows more about cooking burgers from across the street at Burger King than selling what welding and gas supplies.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0de3e5a7591d:0x4c4ae003bd9abbd"}
