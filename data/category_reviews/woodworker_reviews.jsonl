He gave us pricing on what he had and told us to check out the shop area and to let him know if we needed help with any lumber. We also refinish furniture for a living and are on the look out for good fixer uppers to refinish and resell. So we walked around the top and bottom floor. They had nothing of good quality to choose from. We then made our way out to the \"OPEN TO THE PUBLIC COME ON IN\" shop area.

Then he approaches me and tells me if I'm not here to buy anything from him to leave right now and never come back. He turns back around to my husband who was holding our 1 year old in his arms and leans in like he is about to grab him and yells to my husband to walk faster and to get out.

{"user_id": "100997616840140597450", "name": "Blake", "time": 1600187085659, "rating": 1.0, "text": "We built a new house with a builder who uses Custom Interior as their cabinet supplier. Multiple of the cabinets were incorrectly drilled in our house and had old drill holes in them that were partly patched. No problem though, as I confirmed with the cabinet making rep that he was reordering all of the messed up cabinets and he would have them done in two weeks, prepared for our \u201c30 day appointment,\u201d November 11, 2019.\n\nWe were scheduled for said appointment exactly 30 days from our closing date, with all necessary parties notified and told to be there with the time frame of 8:30-11:30. Custom interior hadn\u2019t shown up about 11:15 so we called our builder and told them. At approximately 1:30, their guys showed up with all of the wrong cabinet doors and parts they needed, telling me they \u201choped they could come back that night, but they weren\u2019t sure.\u201d So they didn\u2019t show up for the scheduled appointment, had to be reminded about it and got there with all of the wrong parts for installation.\n\nAt my PSI one week before our closing date, we walked through pointing out all of the broken cabinets that were going to be replaced by Custom Interior, we documented them and I was asked to sign off that other than the documented cabinets, the others were good to go. I even made sure to ask the Custom Interior head who we met with point blank to clarify and make sure all DOCUMENTED cabinets would be replaced, to make sure that wouldn\u2019t come back on us. And it\u2019s lucky that I did.\n\nI followed-up with our builder later that afternoon of our 30 day appointment, NOV 11, 2019, asking what is going on with the cabinet people. They informed me that the cabinet guy, with whom I spoke and made sure with that my broken cabinets would be replaced, had informed our builder that \u201cwe signed off on all of the cabinets being good and that he wasn\u2019t supposed to replace them...\u201d So he custom ordered me cabinets, sent his guys out to my house to replace them with the wrong parts, and then had the audacity to try and throw me under the bus and say that \u201cI had signed off on them.\u201d You can imagine I was quite upset at the fact that he was attempting to circumvent his job requirements. I informed the builder of this and was told that I would be kept updated as to what would happen.\n\nSo it\u2019s now been 40+ days since move in, the head at the company has attempted to undermine me and get out of doing this job, I still have messed up cabinets and will again have to take a day off of work to try and meet them, with them hopefully being prepared this time.\n\nI realize I shouldn\u2019t have given our builder the ability to close without everything fixed properly and yes that is my mistake. However, having Custom Interior show a complete lack of professionalism through this process and their non-caring attitude towards their customers, I can and will never recommend this company to you, nor can I advise you to do business with any builder that uses them as a sub-contractor, unless you ensure everything is complete pre-closing.\n\nEDIT to add final info:\n\nThey did show up NOV 26, 2019, but only replaced the pull out drawers that were drilled incorrectly. They, for a second time, brought a wrong sized cabinet door and did not bring a soft-close hinge for the one cabinet that needed it.They showed back up January 27, 2020 and replaced the cabinet door, but still did not bring the soft-close hinge. February 3, 2020, the soft-close hinge was finally brought and installed and we had fully-functioning cabinetry.\n\nTo summarize, 115 days of excruciating service. They have to be constantly monitored and reminded just to do the job they agreed to do. Even with the exact cabinet specs documented for my house, they still managed to build and bring incorrect cabinetry three times before they were all fixed. It's unprofessional and absolutely unacceptable.\n\nThough the cabinets are good quality, I'm sure you can find 5 other cabinet suppliers in the area that will do the job just as well, without all of the emails, heartache, and wasted time.\n\nTrash company with non-existent leadership.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862695ead5d35ef:0x1f9811c7fc8a4a2"}
