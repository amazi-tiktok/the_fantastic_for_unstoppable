Recently in 2017,  I took my mother back to see Dr Hadley because she was having a tingling sensation that started in her hip and ran all the way down to the top of her foot.  She was in constant pain and was unable to sit still for extended periods of time.  She never went anywhere and was never able to enjoy life because of the chronic pain she was experiencing.  Dr Hadley looked at her x-rays and felt confident he could give her relief from her pain by doing a fusion on her lower back (L2-L5).  My mother is 67 years old so I was nervous about her going under anesthesia but Dr Hadley assured me he wouldn't do anything to my mother he wouldn't do on a loved one of his own.  My mother went in for surgery on July 14th and had two rods and three screws put into her lower lumbar region of her back.  In a matter of days, she had relief from the pain she had been experiencing for years!  Today, she is 4 weeks out from her surgery, an inch and a half taller, and she is doing wonderful!

Also, while waiting on him the door was closed the entire time and anyone else that entered closed the door behind them. He ask me what my job title was twice which I\u2019m sure was on my report. He indicated that the fracture was healing pretty good I didn\u2019t need surgery and therefore there was nothing else he could do. I question him because I must be 100% my strength in my hand indicated that I could hold up to13lbs briefly. I asked him for copies of the report he denied me of that also, stating that workman\u2019s comp would have to request it. Forgetting when I visit him the first time he did.  His sarcastic remarks and tone was very belittling. To add insult to injury as he was walking out he says if you break anything else come see me. Unbelievable and Rude he obviously doesn\u2019t care because there\u2019s no repercussions behind his actions.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922bd85c058bf:0x3d854a56536510d4"}

Dr.Hedden at my consult seemed nice enough it was a bit of a wait but he apologized for it no biggie or so I thought . I must admit that they do tell you that you probably won't go back immediately you will have some wait. Well I was coming from out of town my surgery was to be at 9:30 am I didn't get called back until 12:20. I had asked what was taking so long as I was paying for a caretaker by the hour and hadn't eaten the night before, I asked the Dr. personally about it he said sorry but sometimes in surgery things happen it shouldn't be much longer he seemed to get agitated but still professional offered me a refund I stated no since I had waited over 3 hours by this time please proceed as soon as possible. While another hour and 30 minutes go by with me in this thin bathroom no nurse or anything comes to check on me I put my clothes back on and ask the lady at the front how much longer she states she didn't know and she went and found someone. By this time I go back to my room then comes in Patrick who was very nice and was going to start my IV, they called him out of the room then comes in Nurse Manager Win (Nguyen ). She states how can we make you happy I'm like at this point just get my arm surgery started and I'm happy I told her I was fine I just wanted to get it over with since I have come all this way. She states I dont think we can make you happy you're going to give the practice a \"bad review\" I said I am about the lack of communication but I can't say anything about surgery. I was like I'm over it I just want to get my arm lift done so I can go home. She basically said they didn't want to do it because I complained about the wait time. Who or what person taught these people business etiquette I wasn't loud I just stated that I would be giving a review to let people know how they treat their patients. I stated again I'm fine she extended a discount on cool sculpting I accepted I thought everything was fine. Dr. Hedden comes in very very nasty and stated we're not doing your surgery and we're giving you a full refund and I told him I was fine I wasn't happy but not angry enough not to have my surgery after I have waited over 5 hours he storms out wouldn't hear it. They didn't give me a on refund on my travel or hotel, informed the spa not to do my cool sculpting, and also would not honor a gift certificate that I was given. I wasn't all smiles and giggles, but I didn't get loud or curse. The staff couldn't believe it and said they had never heard of such. Please don't go there Dr. Hedden is a bully and don't dare ask to question why you are waiting or you too could be out of money and time beware stay away awful !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1504756710051, "text": "We always try to do everything to accommodate patient's. What happened in this case which she is not disclosing is that she requested a late arrival time. She was told in doing that she could not be given an exact start time but that she would be following other cases. She expressed that she was upset about the wait when she first arrived. Our office manager offered her and her care giver a free spa service for the inconvenience. She seemed to be happy at that point. When she was brought back I explained we were sorry for any delay but that when someone ask for a delayed start time that it becomes more dependent on the cases before them which are not something that can be predicted. She then explained she was upset that she was paying for a sitter she hired and was having to pay her. I explained we would pay for the sitters time for her delay. Again she seemed happy with that. She then told the nurse that she also wanted some other procedures for free or she would write a bad review if she was not given them. She had voiced this to several staff members. I then went back into the room and told her I did not feel comfortable operating on someone who was blackmailing the practice in an attempt to get procedures for free. That this was not the right way to start a doctor patient relationship and that we would offer her a full refund and cover her sitter for any inconvenience but that I could not proceed now that threats were made in an attempt to get more free services when we had already tried to do so much for her. She then went up to the spa and asked for monetary exchange for the free spa services we had just given her. We always do everything we can to help our patients and do whatever we can to make their experience as nice as possible but this was not our fault. There is a reason we are one of the busiest practices in the country and it's because we do great work and take care of our patients. We treat everyone as if they were family.

I would NEVER recommend him for anything. They were 5 hours behind the day I got my surgery. I went almost two days without food or water. When I went back to have the IV put in, because I was so dehydrated it took two different people to stick me about 12 times. Finally got back and they stuck me in the supply closet/room where all the implants was. I was like what the heck. I should have walked out. I told the anesthesia to please give me something for nausea before they woke me up, due to I will start thowing up. I woke up in a wheelchair, at my car, 8pm at night, throw up bowl and throwing my guts up. The anesthesia basically said okay to my husband and took the wheelchair and took off. I felt like I had been hit by a train. I thought I was truly going to die that night.  I was sick and hurt for days. When I went back I was so extremely disappointed in my upper and lower eye lift. Dr Hedden was like, oh well that\u2019s all I can do. Long story short, breast augmentation drop huge in 2 years, I had them removed by another surgeon. The other surgeon also told me Dr Hedden did not remove the fatty tissue in my lower eyelid, so that\u2019s why I still had sagging. I was also told Dr Hedden\u2019s office was known for breast implants in and out, in and out. Trust me, you get what you pay for.  Go to a better surgeon!!! That was a waste and two years to pay off $7,000.00.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1524428272023, "text": "We have searched through our system and there is no patient by this name. I personally checked every Glenda as well as the one and only Tippett but who has a different first name. I looked at all of those patients charts to see if anyone may have had the surgery this person talks about and no one did. So she most likely has us confused with another practice. I\u2019m going to respond to this review though just to give some clarification on our practice and how this could not have happened. First of all no one is ever asked or told to go without food or water for more than 6 hours before their scheduled surgery time. That\u2019s just no safe. Second this person states she was put in a closet. Not really sure what practice could really look like that but ours obviously does not. Anyone reading this can simply take the virtual tour which shows our operating rooms and see that we are probably the nicest surgery center in Alabama and with cardiac size operating rooms. So I really believe she has us confused with another practice. We do all types of cosmetic surgery and are world renowned for all types of cosmetic breast surgery as well. But for the last 15 years I have always charged the same price. I just think that\u2019s doing right by the Patient by trying to make plastic surgery more affordable. But what she put as what she paid is nowhere closed to what we charge for the procedures she states she had. We always remove fat when lid surgery is performed but some fat has to remain around the orbit to cushion and protect the eye. We also have some of the best anesthesia staff in the city and always give patients nausea medication and never have someone leave before their wide awake and able to take care of themselves. Anesthesia does not wheel them to their car. Our recovery nurses help them outside. Lastly I give my cell number to every single patient that comes through our office if someone has a problem I would hope they would actually call the number. I give out my number because I truly do care about all of our patients that\u2019s why I even still make house calls if needed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889160ab45d4869:0x3e6975f2afcb69a5"}

I have contacted his office serveral times to discuss the issues and was brushed off. I will now be seeking a malprimalpr lawsuit, as the implants have caused more and more pain over the years and made my job as an exotic dancer impossible to perform. I can not even look in the mirror without crying and I suffer a lot of pain. I would not recommend this man to anyone. He acts like he is the best doctor until you have an issues .my deformity issues showed as soon as the swelling was down and I was informed that this was his mistake. I am also suffering CC due to him placing textureed implants when this was not what I was asked for at all. His resolution to this issue was to just remove the inplants he placed, leaving me with scars and saggy breasts. I plan to gather all of the women I have found in online support groups that he has wronged.\nEdit*** I am most definitely one of your patients and have the serial numbers on a card to prove that you used a textured Sientra implant on me. When I confronted Dr. Hedden about this and the double bubble within weeks after surgery, he told me that he would remove my implants and not offer any money back or to replace the implants. I wore all support recommended and didn't try to go back to dancing until years after surgery, which I can also prove. I also have records from a plastic surgeon that I saw in Georgia within months after my surgery, who informed me that a doctor should not have used the implants used, neither texture nor size, neither of which Dr. Hedden spoke to me about before or after surgery. All he did waswbrush me off. I have been suffering since surgery and plan to sue if something is not done to make this right, and especially since you are now denying the use of textured implants. Also, I don't have my full name on this site and use a nickname for my own safety.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1540401214274, "text": "We tried to find this patient in our system but no one comes up with her name or anything close to it. We also do not use textured implants as the carry a risk of patients developing a form of cancer. So I\u2019m not sure if this is a patient of ours or even a true patient.  But I will try to respond to her issues. We do perform close to a thousand implants each year and do have several patients who are also dancers. I always try to stress this to dancers ..that you must wear very good support during the healing process and reframe from dancing for the first 3-4 weeks. Otherwise your pocket is not healed enough to prevent migration of the implant down and to the side which is the direction the muscle wants to push it. Patients that come in with no droopiness and wanting a good small implant do not have their muscle changed and so most of the time the implant will not shift much. Also going above the muscle would typically not lead to this but patients would be at higher risk for rippling and capsular contracture (CC). But if someone wants either a very large implant or they have severe droopiness then it will lead to some of the inferior pectoral muscle having to be detached to allow the larger implant to fit or the droopiness to be camouflaged. Thus running the risk of lateral drift if the muscles are used too soon such as an exotic dancer going back to work right away and or not wearing support. So it is very important to always follow the guidelines from your surgeon to minimize any risk of complications. We always offer bliss insurance which would cover any cost of fixing any issues as well. So I\u2019m not sure she is a true patient or our patient because she would have most likely obtained this.\nAddendum; she called our office yesterday and is using a different name here but she is very mistaken she does not have textured implants. My nurse called the implant company and gave the serial number to them as well. This is not the appropriate placed to discuss these issues as she should come back in and see us but she wishes to slander us and make accusations that are completely wrong. When someone comes in with droopiness , one breast lower than the other and their breast drifting to the sides because of their chest wall you have a few options all of which are always offered to patients. Asymmetry and droopiness.. best treated with a lift with implants ( cost twice as much and leaves scar that not all patients want ) or biplaner breast augmentation ( less cost , less , scaring but carries the risk of feeling the implant at the bottom and slight double bubble) or going above the muscle (requires silicone, higher risk of capsular contracture). If she really wants this to be educational for you she would consent to her pictures being shown which will show where she started and where she was 3 months out and let everyone judge for themselves. Now it\u2019s very easy to seek a second opinion and a doctor not that busy to say ( without even seeing your before pictures) that something was done wrong. You must understand not all doctors offer all options and some have no experience with biplaner approaches. They will be quick to say something was done wrong so they can charge you to be reoperated on. Always be careful of the doctor giving an opinion without seeing your before pictures. Again this is not the best way to discuss your concerns."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889160ab45d4869:0x3e6975f2afcb69a5"}

I had a breast augmentation in July of 2012 and it was okay. I did 290cc of saline I can't say anything bad about that surgeon. I just wanted an upgrade I wanted them bigger and I wanted silicone! I had a friend that went to dr. Hedden and she was very pleased with him, so I decided I scheduled a consultation with him it took me about 2 months to get a consultation. I was in the office for probably 15 mins before I was called into a room to see dr. Hedden! Me and my boyfriend played around with the samples while we waited to see what size we liked. I was kinda hard for me to tell what it would look like since I already had implants. Originally I was wanting to go to a 450! But me and my boyfriend continued to talk about it and said we really couldn't even tell a difference so we picked 500 (he wanted me to go a lot bigger being a male of course) but I researched and researched females my size and 500 cc of silicone gel, and I truly liked the size and I felt those would look best! My consultation was July the 14th and that day we scheduled the surgery for august the 10th. My surgery was scheduled for 8 I got back in the room about 9 around 10 the took me back for surgery. I remember waking up around 12:15 and I left at 12:30, I ended up getting 525cc silicone gel! It was a super easy process. I felt like everything was done in a timely manor. I stayed the night the night of my surgery and had to follow up post op day one, while I was there I got some juvaderm injections in my lips! It was pretty painful but I have to say I absolutely love them! They a beautiful I've received so many compliments on my lips! I'm now post op day 5 I can pretty much do anything I'm still a little sore! I will return to work Friday and I can't wait to show off my lips! I highly recommend dr. Hedden and his facility. He truly listens to you and your concerns. He puts his patients first. The staff is awesome as well, they make you feel at home. And the anesthesiologist was great to! The day after I got home I had a get well soon card from his facility which was super kind. If I could do it all over again I wouldn't change one thing!

You will wait more than a month with you calling weekly and still never receive a call back.

The problem then comes that every time I have ever gotten the scheduling, non operators, with your headset turned all the way up, you cannot hear them and they cannot hear you.

When I found out on 8/15/2020 that I would need my gallbladder removed, I called his office and scheduled an appointment for 8/20/2020. When I started running a fever and having chills on 8/16/2020 (which is one of the things the hospital ER nurse practitioner warned me to seek care for if it happened) my primary physician started me on antibiotics and recommended that I contact Dr Zelickson\u2019s office and leave a message for his nurse so that they could hopefully see me sooner.\n\nInstead, his nurse asked me \u201cwhy I thought it was my gallbladder anyway\u201d and (mistakenly) informed me that gallbladder issues don\u2019t cause fevers. She said she would have to ask if they could still see me in the office at all because of this. Never mind that my primary physician\u2019s office understood that there is a possibility of infection, and never mind that the ER physician and nurse practitioner both understood this as well. This nurse didn\u2019t believe it was an issue. She acted like I had no idea what I was talking about and had just decided all on my own that I needed my gallbladder removed.\n\nI immediately contacted another surgeon\u2019s office. Nobody there had a problem understanding what was going on- the nurses didn\u2019t , the surgeon didn\u2019t, and the receptionist didn\u2019t. She had me come in that very same afternoon (yesterday, 8/18/2020) and my wonderful new general surgeon recognized the issue at hand. He removed my gallbladder this morning (8-19-2020) and it was necrotic and covered in pus. THAT is what was causing my fever, and THAT is how a knowledgeable office handles this.\n\nDr Zelickson and his nurse were flat-out wrong. His nurse called me later yesterday (after I had already called and spoke to receptionist about why I was canceling my appointment) because they needed to reschedule me due to my temperature. Thank goodness I found a surgeon with qualified nurses who actually know how to recognize an infection. I couldn\u2019t eat and could barely drink from 8/15/2020 on.

Surgery was scheduled, completed, and sucessful. Sadly, several years after receiving his pacemaker dad was diagnosed with Stage IV metastasized lung cancer. Dad had issues of panic/anxiety attacks which were originally thought to have been heart related. After visits and test with Dr. Cash, he diagnosed him with anxiety attacks, just from the shear stress of being a cancer patient. Dr. Cash went above and beyond to care and treat our dad.

Therefore their profit margin is much more important than patient care and treatment.  Some of their policies reflect that also. For instance, if you go to the ER needing surgery, if there is not a DR. to do that surgery on duty, you will have to wait until one is scheduled if it \"probably\" won't kill you to wait.  My husband waited 3 days for an orthopedic surgeon for a spiral break in his femur, which is a very dangerous bone to break. It's where our blood supply is made and when broken, releases air bubbles and clots into the blood stream so he was kept on blood thinners for 3 days before major surgery.  Now, not only did the hospital get to charge us for those 3 extra days and all his normal medications, because you are NOT allowed to take your own from home, but they did NOT have to pay a surgeon overtime or vacation pay to come in when off duty, so we are cash cows to that hospital.  The nurses are horribly underpaid and badly treated, but with Huntsville Hosp. owning all hospitals for 8 counties, they really don't have a lot of choices. Most of the nurses were wonderful, however the Dr.'s, especially Dr. Wright, made us feel like our health was secondary to profit, pushing hard for procedures we are very hesitant about and offering no real evidence they would even help. In fact he told us straight out that it probably would not help, but it just might.  Just be aware the Dr.'s are Huntsville Hospitals life blood money and do your research, ask lots of questions, ask about safety and recalls for any hardware they want to implant. In our case the Defibrillator manufacturer was being sued in a class action suit because the leads were corroding and impaling the arteries, but they were still using these defibs and when we asked about them Dr. Wright's answer was, and I quote \"they all have problems\". Now that's not exactly comforting.  We told him we wanted to do some research and think about it, but that did not stop his office from calling us EVERYDAY for 3 weeks until I asked them not to call us ever again, we would call them if we changed our minds. Then we were told it was their job to \"recruit 12 to 18 surgeries PER DAY\".  Yes after 35 years of marriage, it is an \"us\" decision.  We both feel very uncomfortable with it all.

Yesterday she went into see the dr and he had no idea what meds she was taking and what milligrams, are you kidding me, your nurse practitioner never showed up to review medications.  She is on coreg which needs to be taken two times a day, but the orders said one.  They changed her meds to hydralazine along with the coreg, the hydralazine is to be taken three times a day, but again the orders said once a day. Yesterday they took her blood pressure in the office and said it was 120/70, and my sister said that is strange. It has been running high, and she snapped back well not today.  Then the dr took it and it was 200/94, really.  On the way home from work last night my sister stopped to pick up meds and only one was there, a water pill, not the increased dosage of coreg or hydralazine.

I received a verbal diagnosis for my ailment from Dr. Sheppard consistent with \u201cStage 1\u201d case (as commonly described, relative to Stage 2,3,4). Dr. Sheppard specifically told me that the ailment was not even a Stage 2 case (commonly tolerated by folks for decades without surgery). He recommended surgical repair in my case, before the ailment got too much worse which could be a \u201cmess\u201d to repair and take longer to recover from. Dr. Sheppard said I had six months to make the decision for surgery. \u201cPrompt\u201d treatment was not needed at the time of this consultation.\n\n(Note: For the new patient consultation mentioned above, the CPT Billing Code that Dr. Sheppard chose to bill to my medical insurance company with was the equivalent of a \"Level 5\" (the most expensive). The CPT code fitting for the office visit was more like a Level 1 (least expensive).)\n\nA few weeks later I scheduled the ailment surgery \u2026 for a date less than two weeks after that.\n\nTwo days prior to the surgery, Dr Sheppard made me prepay the full cost of the surgery, consistent with the CPT billing code for a Stage 2 case.\n\nI was not experiencing any symptoms of a \u201cStage 3\u201d case the morning of date of surgery. My ailment was painless and did not require \u201cprompt\u201d treatment on the date of surgery. If I had been at Stage 3 the morning of the surgery, I would have known. My ailment was a Stage 2 or less case the morning of the surgery.\n\nJust before surgery, Sheppard gave the ailment the quick once-over and said nothing to me to indicate that my ailment was any worse than what he had observed during the consultation a month prior.\n\nAfter surgery, Sheppard did not indicate to my wife on the phone that the surgery was any more involved than expected. During the call, my wife specifically asked Sheppard on the phone if there had been any \u201ccomplications\u201d with the surgery. Answer from Dr. Sheppard: No.\n\nAt this one-month follow-up appt, Dr. Sheppard did not indicate to me that the surgery had been more involved than expected. In fact, Dr. Sheppard didn\u2019t even talk to me about how the surgery itself had gone - I had to ask him about that as he was quickly walking outside of the exam room after the conclusion of the office visit. He then simply acknowledged that the surgery had gone fine.\n\nA few days after my one-month follow up appt with Dr Sheppard, I first received the bill in the mail. This was the first time I learned that Dr. Sheppard had applied a more expensive, Stage 3 CPT billing code to my surgery, as opposed to the Stage 2 billing code that I had already paid in full against two days prior to surgery.\n\nThere is a big difference between a case recently diagnosed as a Stage 1 and prepaid in full as a Stage 2 .. vs. a Stage 3 case that could lead to the death of the patient once it reaches Stage 4 - these two scenarios shouldn\u2019t both be billed with the Stage 3 CPT billing code.\n\nSheppard is being dishonest to classify my ailment, undetectable-by-patient-and-surgeon-prior-to-surgery as a \u201cStage 3\u201d case, as an actual, CPT billing code Stage 3 case.  Sheppard should have billed my medical insurance company with the less costly billing code that he had me prepay to a couple days prior to surgery.\n\nEvery time Dr Sheppard pulls this stunt on a patient, he pockets an additional $428.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862133af32551f9:0xed3c381b4d412388"}

The hard coughing during that time apparently loosen the last piece of mesh and had migrated to the opening of my wound.\nDr. Sheppard Jr. had review my medical history of 2012 and at my second appointment was able to remove the piece of mesh through the hole of my wound. Within 48 hours, I knew I was starting to heal.\n\"Thank You\" for all your help & God Bless You!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862133af32551f9:0xed3c381b4d412388"}

She told me to quit wearing the cast and start to use it. If it wasn't better in 2 weeks I would need to see a surgeon. Well I saw a surgeon today and it is too late to fix my thumb. He put a stack splint on to try and pull the bones together so fibrous tissue can form and help with my pain. I will never have full function of my thumb again, it won't bend all the way due to the break. And I will never be able to use my thumb without pain. It will also get arthritis because it was left untreated. Basically, the 5 weeks I spent under Dr Casey's care was a complete waste of my time.

My second visit I left crying because he screamed at me so bad as if I was lying and made my injury up just to get paid under workers comp because he ordered a carpal tunnel test that came back positive be he explained to me the Dr. was wrong who performed the test and that half the people in the lobby would come back positive for carpal tunnel even though they don't have it. My thoughts was why would you test me for carpal tunnel which would include the middle finger, the pointer finger and the thumb only when I have clearly from day one told you my pinky finger and ring finger are numb and painful which would be cubital tunnel. So for his mistake I was scolded like a toddler. He then ordered an MRI which came back schowing a tear in my right wrist on my tfc disk and on top of that an ganglion cyst 16mm by 6 mm that has grown inside my inner wrist. When the results came back he canceled my visit and told his staff to inform me that I need to find another doctor to assist me...WOW IS ALL I CAN SAY!!!

He asked me everything that was going on from the timeline to his symptoms. After listening to me, he assured me that I was on the right track with the colonoscopy.\n\nHe had every opportunity to schedule an appointment just because he could, as we were at such a vulnerable state. But he didn\u2019t, and I respect and appreciated that. I can tell that this doctor really cares about his patients, their care, their results, their well-being, and he loves what he does!\n\nIf you watch his video, what he says lines up with what he delivered to me over a simple phone call.

My huge remorse is I did not do it years ago because of fear! Being referred by my heart doctor to Dr. Mailapur was an absolutely lifesaving experience.  I had Gastric Sleeve surgery in November of 2020. I am now down over 125 pounds and still losing weight. It was like carrying around over two 60 pound sacks of concrete!  My goal is to lose about 160 pounds. The new way of living and using the tool given to me by Dr. Mailapur has transformed my life. I was taking 225 units of insulin a day. Now I don\u2019t take any insulin! I was taking four 500mg of Metformin a day. Now I don\u2019t take any! I was taking two 20mg blood pressure pills. Now I take one 2.5 mg. I feel SO much healthier. Before my surgery I could not get up off the floor/ground without a chair to help me get back up. It is hard to describe the difference in how much healthier I feel. The energy level, mood, aches and pains are so improved. My family doctor has been encouraging me to have the surgery for years. I was just too scared. BUT, my A1C was climbing, my insulin needs were climbing, heart issues were getting lots worse, and my weight was out of control. I had to get help. My heart doctor recommended I have the surgery and said he would only sign for Dr. Mailapur to be my surgeon. He totally trusted him as a surgeon.  I was also blessed that during my surgery Dr. Mailapur found a rare Cancer in my stomach and removed it ALL. According to the Cancer Doctor (Dr. Mailapur sent me to) in about 48 months I would of had stage 4 stomach cancer. I had a hernia Dr. Mailapur also removed/repaired during my surgery. The first few days were a little tough.  BUT, I left the need and desire to constantly eat in the OR at the hospital. My relationship with food addiction has totally changed.  I was encouraged by several people that had the bariatric sleeve surgery to get the surgery. Each one seemed to want to tell me I needed to do it. One offered to carry me. I now understand why they wanted to share this enormous life change with me. It is such a good positive change and blessing in my life. I, myself, now want to share it with others! You want other to have this exciting progressive change in their lives. Dr. Mailapur and everyone in his office has supported me through this journey. I was truly blessed to have this great compassionate team provide me a tool that has literally saved my life!  Thank you Dr. Mailapur and Amanda! And, Jessica for answering all my email questions!

Between the information seminars, the appointments, and pre-op nutrition class, they take the time to ensure that potential patients learn about the types of surgeries that are offered and the pros and cons of each.  Additionally, the pre-op nutrition class and follow up appointments in particular do a great job of informing you of the needed dietary, medical, behavioral, and lifestyle changes that are necessary to properly maintain your health.\n\nIt's been a year since I underwent surgery with Dr. Mailapur.  The surgery went extremely well and I have had no complications with it.  At this point, I have lost 105 lbs from my highest weight pre-surgery.

But due to the herniation, nerve damage and drop foot , I ate. Being a chef by trade I knew how to cook food. I also knew  how to eat.  I had my 7 year check up with Dr. Mailapur this morning and I have achieved 83% weight loss. Anything over 80% is a huge achievement but it is never without the ups and downs. If your just wanting information or you have made the decision to have gastric bypass surgery .... I personally think that Dr. Mailapur and his staff along with Huntsville Hospitals staff will be an excellent choice for your surgical needs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605874432286, "text": "Thx a lot.

I struggled with being overweight my whole life, as has most of my family.  I got to the point where I knew enough was enough and I was ready for help.  I went on Google and began doing research on bariatric surgeons in Huntsville and everything that I could find pointed to Dr. Mailapur as being the best!  And from my experience, that is ABSOLUTELY the case!  I have recommended many people to him after my surgery and they have since had theirs done as well, including my wife.  It has changed both of our lives for the better!  Not just physically, but more mentally than anything!  Dr. Mailapur and his staff go above and beyond with you to make sure that you know absolutely everything you need to know before and after your surgery and what you need to do.  It's now been four years since my sleeve and I almost can't remember what it was like to be that guy that first walked into his office at 317 pounds.  In just 9 months after my surgery I lost 125 pounds and have settled at 100 pounds down!  This is what I tell people all the time about having the sleeve done...if you're thinking about it, STOP and just do it!  And, do yourself a favor to see Dr. Mailapur!  The other surgeons in town are great too.  But, none of them go to as much lengths to make sure that you are educated and protected.  Even doing extra tests during surgery to make sure that everything is good!  And, the fact that Dr. Mailapur gets the exact same surgical team every time says something!  He's known as the best and he gets the privileges and respect as being the best.  Dr. Mailapur also removed my gallbladder a couple months ago and it was the easiest surgical experience that I've had; even during COVID.  Trust me!  You can't go wrong with Dr. Mailapur and his staff.  You know it's a good atmosphere when you never see any turnover in the staff!  It's been the same people since I've been going there!  Amber, Jessica, Amanda...all of them awesome!  It's like going to see my friends at every annual checkup!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615435616288, "text": "Wow Bronson.

I am writing this review as I near my 3 year post-op date and, though my regular visits have ended, anytime that he see me, or even a family member, he ask if things are continuing to go well and offers encouragement or even a \"kick in the pants\" if needed.\n\nIf I were to sum up what an experience with Dr. Mailapur and his office is like it would be: You will leave feeling safe, informed, and cared for!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601057090649, "text": "Thx Brian.

Visited at the recommendation of my physical therapist for a shoulder issue. When I got to the lobby I could tell this place is set up for mass production: there were check-in kiosks like at the airport and a bunch of people waiting. When I was called the first time, it was to pay. When I was called the second time, I was led to a second  waiting room with no explanation. The third time I was led to an x-ray room where I found out I was getting x-rays. Surprise! Eventually, I was led to an examination room. No vitals were taken. I waited. Eventually, a doctor - not the one I had the appointment with - showed up and immediately started to discuss scheduling surgery without examination. He discussed two procedures - the second one was news to me. When I inquired, he then tested my range of motion to confirm what he had seen in the tests. I expressed doubts about the second procedure and he left to get the originally-scheduled doctor. After nearly 30 minutes, they both came back. The second (scheduled) doctor explained why he recommended the second procedure as a preemptive option. He did a good job of explaining the surgery and recovery. He left and the first doctor took me to a scheduler. Everyone I interacted with was cordial and professional. I never saw my x-rays nor the MRI I had brought with me. I realize this place is good and they have a lot of people to get to. I known they are all fine surgeons. But still, I felt like one more item to check off on their to-do list. I still have unanswered  questions and it is ironic that being there for 2.5 hours and waiting most of the time, that I felt rushed when it came to the consultation.

I was without pain, discharged, and went home the same day. Ten days after surgery I drove non-stop from Meridian, Mississippi to San Antonio, Texas. Last July he performed Lumbar Laminectomy surgery and removed the debris and spurs that were causing numbness in both legs and prohibited me from standing up straight. Again, discharged the same day, feeling returned to both legs and walking as the Good Lord intended.  There is not another Doctor on the planet I would allow to cut on my spine than Dr. Nichols.\n\nHis professionalism exemplifies what Andrews Sports Medicine stands for.  My family and I were always given  the same care and concern as the professional athletes they have become famous for treating. Simple logic dictates that if world class professional athletes with unlimited resources, who depend on their bodies performing at the level they do, seek out his services, it must be top notch.

Despite having to refer me, he is still looped in on the process and making sure I get the care I need.

I also want to add that he recommends an overnight stay at a hotel so you can be checked by his protege in the evening.

Dr. McLain is a double  board-certified physician who is really nice and down-to-earth. I felt very comfortable discussing my dental issue with him.\n\nNo dental procedure is ever \u201cfun\u201c - especially when a tooth must be extracted, but the procedure was done in a second it seemed. Of course, I asked to be sedated so I didn\u2019t feel a thing! Everything went very well! The procedure took half an hour from start to finish and that includes checking in and out.\n\nOnce I arrived home, I had a few questions which they responded to on-the-spot. I\u2019m currently in the process of  healing and waiting for the implant procedure. Everything\u2019s gone exactly as planned and I\u2019ve had zero issues.\n\nI would absolutely recommend 100%. If you\u2019re fearful in seeing an oral surgeon, don\u2019t be. Don\u2019t ignore the pain, McLain Surgical Arts will take great care of you! Waiting only makes matters worse. I needed this procedure done a few months ago but due to Covid I was afraid to see a doctor. The entire staff follow CDC Covid procedures.

Which made me as comfortable as possible. Me and my brother got it done the same morning and were in and out in no time. I had zero pain afterwards, so much that I didn't even require the medication. I highly suggest this doctor because the atmosphere and friendly staff put you at ease. This extraction experience was easier and more pain free then some of my cleanings!

Everyone was telling me it was a very unpleasant procedure, but they were wrong in this case!. The doctor made me wait an extra five minutes on the anesthesia to make doubly sure I was completely numb, which I appreciated. Basically, he didn't try to  rush this at my expense.  And, I felt zero pain, not even any discomfort at all!  Even my stitches (which will dissolve) haven't bothered me.\nMy husband drove me home, but I could have driven myself, since I didn't even have the expected bleeding.  The anesthesia just barely started wearing off after I'd already taken my first prescription for pain medication, and so I never suffered at all. When I woke up the next morning, I was prepared to take more pain medication, but I realized I didn't need it and never took any more. What a pleasant surprise.\nDr. McLain personally called me the same evening to find out if I was doing okay.\nAlso, the actual wound was closed up so neatly, you could barely even see it.  Maybe that's because the doctor is also a cosmetic surgeon.  After this experience, I would wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Mclain to anyone.
