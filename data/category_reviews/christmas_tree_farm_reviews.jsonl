Public Service Announcement - see email to customers on 10/27/19 below. They are honest about what happened to cause the lack of trees. Gonna miss them!\n\n\"Hello to our loyal Christmas tree farm customers:\n\nAfter Christmas 2018, we had rain, rain and more rain.  So much rain that the Tennessee River overflowed its banks and did not go away completely for almost 3 months.  Unfortunately, many of our trees could not\nsurvive with the roots underwater for that long.  Then came the drought.  With the trees under more stress, it was not possible to groom them to make them look perfect.\n\nWe lost all the seedlings and most of the 6-10 foot trees.  And many of the larger trees that did survive have brown limbs in one or more places - definitely not suitable for your holiday celebration.\n\nHowever, Roger and I will open the farm  Thanksgiving weekend only this year (Friday, Nov. 29, Saturday, November 30, and Sunday December 1) from noon until dark. But for you, our loyal customers, we will do our best to accommodate your schedules - but call us first so we know when to meet you.\n\nWe still have plenty of perfect trees to sell, so come by that weekend and enjoy your traditional visit.  We'd love to see you and I know our animals would appreciate your visit.  We will also have our hot chocolate\nand hot cider!\n\nUnfortunately, Santa made other arrangements this year so he will not be visiting.\n\nWe are not selling the farm, just not planting any more trees.  We still have the cows, horses, donkeys, mules, chickens and goats, and of course Sophie, our \"puppy\".  We also have fresh farm eggs to sell (we do this all year, so call if you need some).\n\nThank you for your loyalty and business for the 18 years we have owned the Christmas tree farm.  Without you it would not have been so much fun.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRoger and Pat Schwerman\nSchwerman Christmas Tree Plantation\nLacey's Spring, Alabama\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88620c9f84f87beb:0x85d70cea3a1189ad"}

We have gone to this farm several times since our boys were young. It was always a good experience, but not now. None of the trees had been trimmed, but they did offer to trim after we cut. That does not provide a pretty tree properly shaped with new growth. We saw no usable trees.  All were way to tall and big for the typical home. No evidence of regular planting of trees with various ages to select from. We did see one small section of newer trees but they will not be ready for a couple of year.  I would not leave a review except I truly believe this farm is disappointing young children that are excited about the chance to select and cut a tree. Our kids are in college now and we thought it would be fun to cut a tree one last time. It was simply not possible here. We had to go to another farm and barely had time due to the wasted time coming here. The other farm is closing down after this weekend so I am not sure if there is any place near Huntsville that offers the chance for families to cut their own tree.  No big loss for us but I feel bad for those with young kids.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88620c9f84f87beb:0x85d70cea3a1189ad"}

Our kids absolutely loved walking the farm to find our perfect Christmas tree. The owners were very friendly and kind and helped us get the tree back after we cut it. They netted it and helped us load it up. I read the other reviews about the trees not being trimmed and people not even stopping. That's ridiculous to me because it is a tree farm so the trees grow natural. When you find the tree you want, they will trim them for you before you leave. They ask you what you want trimmed. That is part of the magic of this place. You get to pick out, cut down, and shape your own tree. We loved the whole experience! Last year we purchased a live tree that was already cut and trimmed and every tree to choose from looked exactly the same, and it was like why even walk around to pick one out because they are all identical. This year we wanted our kids to have a unique experience. We  went out in the cold rain and did this and all three of our kids said it was the best Christmas tree experience they have ever had and they can not wait to do this again. When you have kids out in the rain and cold and they are still having fun, that is saying a lot, but that is because the tree is only part of this experience. The time spent with family walking around and making a family decision on a tree and then working together to cut it down and get it home...It's so much fun. We will definitely be back next year!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88620c9f84f87beb:0x85d70cea3a1189ad"}

We did not mind at all paying a fee (which was paid before we left) or buying anything (which a wreath was bought).

Instead the old man on the tractor came up to us yelling not only at our photographer but our girls. When we went in to talk to the wife about paying to take the picture, we said he was very aggressive when he came up to us. They laughed.
