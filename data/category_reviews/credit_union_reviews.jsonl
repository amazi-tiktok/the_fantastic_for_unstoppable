If you know when you'd like to come to a branch, you can make an advance appointment to avoid the wait.  With that said, we will be relocating our Brookley branch to Midtown in January 2021 because that larger facility will allow us to open our lobby fully (with social distancing restrictions, of course) as well as offer drive-thru service.    Appointments will still be encouraged because of the social distancing mandates by the state of Alabama.  So, even if a branch is open - only so many members can be served or wait at any one time until state requirements are changed.  Look for announcements about the opening of our Midtown branch in 2021 soon.

For this reason, we offer several other options: Night Drop Boxes at all locations for after hour payments/deposits that will be collected each morning by 8:30 a.m.; a deposit capable ATM at both our West Mobile & Daphne locations, partnership with AllPoint ATM network so members do not have to wait to use our branch ATMs for surcharge free transactions using our debit card (our website at NewHCU.org has a listing of all 55,000 ATM locations nationwide), free 24/7 electronic services such as Online &Mobile Banking, free Voice-24 telephone account access, and free iBill Pay service. Also, our free e-Statements allow you to see what checks have cleared quicker than waiting for mailed statements. Loans can be applied for online as well via our website at NewHCU.org. Our Member Services Center reps at 1-800-824-3610 can help you get enrolled in any and all of our electronic services so you can avoid lines for simple transactions or inquiries.

I am not sure if it is just the person that we dealt with or the entire credit union.  We made an appointment to do an auto loan and it felt like the initial person that helped us at the Clanton branch talked down to us the entire time. We had to leave and get some additional documentation, which was fine, but we were not given all of the information that we needed. I had called to double check to see what we needed and so it was ready when we came back to the branch.  When we came back to the branch a couple of days later I was told that we did not have everything that we needed. On top of that, the person that was supposed to be helping was not even in the branch that day and she had passed everything off to another employee.  I understand that sometimes you can't be at work but the reason for her absence was apparently planned weeks in advance. She had made an appointment with us and we expected to meet with her since she knew the entire scenario.  We did get the loan done, and I am very appreciative of that and the employee that helped us the second time, but it was much harder than it had to be! Once we were done with the loan we, again, did not get all the information that should have been passed to us. We were informed that insurance was going to be force placed on the loan if we did not provide proof of insurance.  We got insurance on the vehicle BEFORE we even went to finalize the loan.

I have gone to the Homewood Branch for 50 years, and could not today because it is temporarily closed.\n\nAs I entered the Branch I was motioned to go up to a window that had a table in front of it. I understand the Covid regulations; however, when I asked to see the manager three times, I was denied. She (Angela) came back from lunch and sat at her desk waiting on no one. I asked repeatedly if I could go to her desk and sit for two reasons: I\u2019m suffering from hamstring tendinitis; and I had four things that needed to be handled, and it is painful to stand for long periods of time.\n\nThe young man at the counter said he could help me; even though he kept asking for help. That is one reason I kept asking for the manager, to speed up the process. I came to fill out a \u201cdispute charges\u201d form ( he could not do that), get a temporary debit card,  because I was told to cut mine up by someone at the Alabaster location.\n\nThe cashier at the counter began to ask for my personal information (account number and last four digits of my SS number) in a loud voice and expected me to holler my personal information from 6 Ft away. Talk about identity theft, let\u2019s just tell everyone in the lobby! I was appalled that he cared more about germs than securing my personal identity. I asked to write info on a piece of paper.\n\nThen he obviously did not know how to dispute charges, again asking for help. Now Angela gets up to go assist him. She never introduced herself to me, apologize to me for delay or inconvenience. They huddled in a corner of Branch long enough for me to ask if there was a problem. This young man was oblivious as to what to do. Angela finished the transaction, and then they were ready for me to leave. I again asked for a temporary debit card, cash and checkbook cover.\n\nI taught Business Education in Jefferson County for 32 years, and none of these employees would have passed in my classes.  They need to improve on human relations, how to treat customers, and how to show kindness to older people, especially ones who say they are disabled.\n\nI will probably have to return to this branch, if Homewood isn\u2019t open.

I've tried to be patient, understanding that they are a smaller institution and lack the systems and experience of larger institutions but it finally became too much to tolerate.  It's been a comedy of ineptitude, bad systems and offensive behavior.\n\nMy account was originally a solo account and we added my wife to the account when we got married almost 30 years ago.  The Credit Union kept losing or failing to acknowledge that document.  I must have added her as a fully authorized user and joint owner on the account over five times through the years.  Once, they wouldn't allow her to pay off a loan saying she wasn't authorized to make payments on a loan we took out together.\n\nMy children have each been stranded out of town with no access to their cash when the credit union froze their accounts suspecting their travel meant fraud.  In each case, the credit union was notified prior to their trips and they still locked their accounts.  In each case, it was over a weekend and they were unable to remove the block until a business day.  One child was in New York City with no cash for food, taxi, subway.  The other was in Minnesota.  Our only choice was to wire our kids cash via Western Union.\n\nOur accounts have been compromised at least 3 times where someone other than us had an AmFirst issued card with our account information and gone on shopping sprees.  In each case the onus was on us to prove we didn't make the purchase, and we had to wait for weeks to be refunded but the credit union refused to give us any case information so we could bring charges against the criminal or even go to police.  They said the fraud was against them, not us.\n\nA fraudster gained access to our son's account and he drove to America's First to report the problem.  They refused to lock his card saying they couldn't verify he wasn't making the out of state purchases as he stood there in the branch.  He stood there with the banker as they watched purchase after purchase drain his account down to zero.\n\nThe final straw was me taking a cashiers check from my investment broker to deposit in my Americas First account.  It was a sizable check but not the first time I'd moved funds between the accounts.  AmFirst said they would have to freeze my funds for 10 business days to make sure the check was good.  They said they had never seen a check from Merrill Lynch and didn't know what to do with it.  I said they could call my broker to verify.  The banker then accused me of attempting felony fraud.  She didn't know if it was a real check and even if it was, I could cash the check then drive to my broker to remove the funds.  I was stunned.  After a 35ish year relationship with Americas First, I'm suddenly going to start passing fraudulant financial instruments?\n\nNo more.  I'm done with them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918fc831ef2df:0xcd34d9945e29099e"}

So, I'm leaving another one to warn you not to trust these people with your money. This is formerly Jefferson County Employees Credit Union, only available to County employees. But after the County filed bankruptcy and laid everyone off, it had to go public to sustain itself. It is still owned and operated by Jefferson County employees, if that tells you anything.  I had a checking and savings account here, along with a line of credit loan. My direct deposit was set up to go 100% into my checking acct., minus my loan payment. But for some reason, they would out of the blue deposit into my savings acct., and my loan wouldn't get paid. AND more than once, my entire paycheck was applied to my loan, without my permission or notification, leaving me with no money! And THEN, they refused to reverse the payment and put the money back! I got away from these idiots and went to a real bank. I recommend everyone else do the same.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888904f1a3ae2507:0x4abb587c2f226dfb"}

I thought the last request was a little strange but I submitted everything anyway. Got a call from an underwriter on Wednesday and this is where I think she just dont have a clue about what she's doing or is extremely racist. She asked me how far was rural king store was from me? I told her about an hour plus. She then ask why I close two credit cards in 2019. Told her I had two credit cards from the same company so I requested that they combine the credits from both cards on to one and close one, which they did. And that i didn't close the barclay card. I was an authorized user on the barclay card and the primary user close the card that's why why it appear on my credit as close. But I went ahead and open up my personal barclay card in December of 2019. She then ended by saying well I'm not satisfied with the two cards that were closed, and there's a fraud alert on your credit and this seems like fraud. I told her yes I place a fraud alert on my credit so that no one can open up fraudulent account in my name. A fraud alert will tell a company to give me a call and verify its me before opening up a new account. People do that all the time. She said well this seems like fraud. I told her you have my ID, Mortgage statement, utility bill, my social security number, phone number that you're talking to me on matches the phone number with the credit bureau that's on my fraud alert, my 2 years of business tax returns with my business name and my home address. I have a 732 fico score and a 80/100 dunn and Bradstreet score. I have all the credentials needed for approval. Credit, income, etc. But all they saw was a driver's license of a beard black guy, that have a fraud alert place on his credit and two close credit cards that one of them he requested to be closed and the other was close by the primary card holder. And the scary part about this entire situation is the young lady that told me all this is an \"underwriter\". An underwriter who's racist or an underwriter that don't know that it's legal to call the credit bureau and request that they place a fraud alert on your credit and give them a number to place on your credit to have potential credit call you and verify its you before opening an account. Also an underwriter that don't know that if you become an authorized user on one of your family members card that entire card history gets transferred to your credit history. And if the person closes that card it will also close on you credit profile. So much for \" Equal Opportunity Lender\".", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590054508039, "text": "Let me assure you that RFCU has a strict policy of non-discrimination not only in the credit union\u2019s lending practices, but in all aspects of conduct throughout RFCU.

Back in November of 2020 I went on a trip to Colorado where I rented a car from hertz Denver airport location.Hertz overcharged me $711.00.\nSo I called All in to file a dispute(this was in December)they sent me the paperwork and told me I would have to wait until they hear something from hertz. January had come and I called the representative stated that they are waiting to hear from hertz still no answers from hertz. Called In February still no answer from hertz and the rep advised me by law they have to give the merchant 180 days. I called again at the end of March early April. Spoke with a representative who advised me they still haven\u2019t heard anything from hertz and that the 180 days are coming to an end by the end of April and for me to callback then. So I waited until May 4, 2021 to call back spoke with a representative named Beverly. Beverly called over to whatever department that handles disputes only to tell me that they still haven\u2019t heard from hertz. Also she advised me that she was told that even though the 180 days were over I still will have to wait until they hear something from hertz. I\u2019m very frustrated because I was told to wait 180 days and still have to wait. All in has showed me that they do not care about their customers only when it benefits them. All in needs a better way to navigate for their customers when it comes to overcharges. I really feel like I got the short in of the stick because I have patiently waited and All in failed. What was the purpose of me waiting 180 days if you guys are going to keep yo-yo in me around?!
