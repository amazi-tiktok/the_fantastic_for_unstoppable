They were super friendly and professional, too. I just think (for me) this is what I like to call a 'hometown' salon and the look I was after was a little more out-of-the-box. My stylist took large random sections without any sort of rhyme or reason, and didn't really consider the texture of my hair when deciding on the techniques and tools to use. It ended up being done more like you would cut a men's fade instead of the soft feminine pixie I was looking forward to. The consultation was brief, and so I tried to throw in more suggestions during the cut, but they were pretty much ignored. Also when I got home, I noticed a few places where it was uneven, which I sorted out on my own. It's just hair and it grows back, but I was looking forward to being pampered for once and to come out feeling good about myself. I even had to style it myself before leaving.

The woman at the front says she will go check (doesn't even apologize for it being 30 minutes past my appointment), then when she comes back she doesn't give me an answer and has her stuff and leaves the building. In the end I just walked out at around 2:15, 45 minutes past my appointment with no haircut and not even an update on when they would be ready.\n\nVery disappointing customer service on my 2nd time there.

I have not once been disappointed.\n\nLooking at previous posts I have to say that those who have posted negatively have had unrealistic expectations. One probably wasn't reasonable, because she probably wasn't clear enough on what she wanted with her son's bangs. Another upset because she was willing to do things with her dye job that a trained person was not.\n\nIt is easy to make calls for your own hair, not quite so easy when it is a client. Would you have posted saying \"I should've listened\" if you had completely burned your hair? I think not.\n\nI am very meticulous when it comes to my hair. I don't get haircuts nearly often enough, but if someone gets something even slightly wrong, I will not go back. This place has got it right every time for me.\n\nFurther, for prom girl's mom, if you want a $100 job, go to a $100 place. You wanted to cut costs, probably because you get rich by working hard and stay rich by pinching pennies; that's on you, not them. If you expect some high dollar results, then go somewhere to pay the price. Don't belittle this place because you think your overpriviledged little snot deserves extra attention you are unwilling to pay for.\n\nI have no question that had you gone to the same place and offered a little extra dough, you would've got what you were looking for. Instead you went there wanting to pay for one thing and get another. You can't pay for a Ford Escort and get a Rolls Royce you entitled fool; it doesn't work that way, and it never will.\n\nBy the way Sophie, while Faith has never done my hair, how can you be so critical and then get professional photographs done by Jorge De Aguinaga Photography so soon after. Looking to save a buck with a review?\n\nIf she had been so horrible, as you described, there's no way you could've taken a photo shoot so soon after. I want to say many mean things at this point, but I won't. I don't know exactly what happened here, I wasn't there, but I do know that you decided to lead a spiteful attack on a professional because she couldn't wave a wand and make you perfect.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f5794f11df:0x4df4b3c01f2e2764"}

It's a nice place for Grissom kids to walk over to and get an easy cut done.\n\nI once went there to go from brown to blonde. The women pulled out some dye samples. I had to remind her that I needed to bleach first, if I wanted to be similar to the hair color of the photo I showed her. Then she kind of argued about it with me, and made me feel bad for suggesting what I wanted. Then she was all \"sorry\" we can't bleach your hair because you have a few sores on the back of your head.

I want to save someone else from spending money they don\u2019t have.\nDisclaimer: This isn\u2019t to \u201cbash\u201d but to literally to bring awareness to customers about the fraud of this shop.\n\nOn 1/30/21 I went to the Weave Zone in Huntsville,AL to purchase hair for graduation pictures. Graduation is something that I looked forward to because I\u2019ve worked so hard and endured a lot along this journey so I decided to celebrate by taking pictures with a certain look. The look I was going for requires deepwave hair.\nI purchased 4 bundles and spent a total of over $300.00. A day later I ran my fingers through one bundle and it was completely nappy and tangled. (Pictures will be attached)...\n\nThey gave me the run around and of course rude customer service but I\u2019m from New York so that little attitude they gave didn\u2019t phase me at all. I\u2019m used to that.\nThey eventually exchanged it and I went about my way.\nNow it\u2019s time to wash the hair ....\nI do hair and have been using bundle hair for years. The pattern completely dropped and ended up looking like straight hair.\nI called the Weave zone and not to my surprise, they refused to compensate me or exchange my hair just because they exchanged a bad bundle. Keep in mind, all these issues were THEIR FAULT! Lol anyway...\nAs I said, no need to be disrespectful towards them in this review because I\u2019ll let the pictures speak for themselves.\nIn closing, ladies , I\u2019m sure you\u2019re reading this review because you are contemplating spending your hard earned money in order to do something nice for yourself. Please go elsewhere, I highly advise it.\nAm I disappointed? Highly. No one has 300 dollars sitting around but I strongly believe that when you\u2019re dishonest, you won\u2019t prosper. The weave zone isn\u2019t exempt from that principle. Have a blessed day ladies!\n\nEDIT/(2/7/21)\n\nOk let me blast you really quick... first of all, there was no harsh chemical. It\u2019s a rinse where you put the NON-TOXIC RINSE, NOT A DYE, on the hair and simply wash it out. (I\u2019ll attach pictures). Everyone knows what a rinse is. Secondly, as I showed your associate, the left bundle with the red rubber band WAS NOT RINSED!! So how do you explain that??? The crunchy bundle I exchanged was also not touched hence why it was exchanged.\nMy point is, the hair you gave me was NOT DEEP WAVE!!! Does that look like deep wave to you? Cut the foolishness. Your hair is trash and I stand by what I said. All proof is provided. How do you over process a non chemical rinse? Go back and look at the picture with the bundle in the red rubber band that wasn\u2019t touched. You\u2019re still going to tell me that\u2019s a deepwave pattern? You\u2019re missing the point of my review. My point is, that is NOT deepwave hair!!!! Instead of replying to me, go invest in a better vendor.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEmTB_3KhaUQ7683Xy0PWgMNo01TLg694-gwaX=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1612709400886, "text": "Ebony, our hair is 1B.

The hair was BEAUTIFUL, until shampooed on 3/17/19 with Tresemme products, and immediately lost all curl pattern. I was the only one in the wedding party with straight hair, and the bride was so disappointed because that was not the look agreed upon. Nevertheless, after speaking with the owner, Tony, who agreed that should not have happened to the hair, and texting him the requested pictures and receipt, I didn't hear back from him. Perplexed, I called the next day, and Tony placed me on hold for 23 minutes! Giving the business the ultimate benefit of the doubt, I waited and called again the next day. Tony was unavailable, but Keyshonna (sp?) told me she had seen the texts from me, and to bring in the hair, along with the receipt, for replacement hair. She told me to call before coming into the store. I could not make it HSV soon, so I called to inform them.  Tony and Keyshonna were unavailable when I called, but I spoke to Lawrence, who kept telling me to call back because they were moving. In anticipation of miscommunication, I texted after each call, just to make sure! Days later, I get to speak to Lawrence, and he finally speaks to Keyshonna about the issue, who remembered me from bringing up the wedding. They discussed it, and informed me that Tony doesn't remember me, and they won't replace or refund the purchase, since it was worn - which all parties knew based on 1) the pictures sent and 2) each text and 3) each conversation!\n\nAs a consumer, I legit waited weeks and several calls and texts to attempt to fix the issue. It hurts me to even have to write this review, and to announce the customer service practices of this business. However, they made it extremely hard to ignore. As a practicing attorney, I have filed accompanying complaints with BBB and BBB of North Alabama, and have all the time and evidentiary proof to file in small claims court over $245, plus legal costs and fees....which is just sad because all I wanted was some long curly hair, and not another court date.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626bfae2fae3bf:0xd21327a29a38657f"}

Stylist was running late, but that's fine, he got there before 12 anyway. He takes the person back who was waiting before me, also fine.

Now they may have had an appointment before me, I don't know. I did overhear that they were expecting a different stylist. Another stylist had been without a client, just waiting around, and she didn't take them. He finishes the highlights, then takes this new client who hadn't been waiting as long as me. It's now an hour past my scheduled time, and I hear him asking what color this woman wants her hair dyed, which would easily take another hour.\n\nI walked out, went to a different salon, and was in and out in 25 minutes. I'm a patient person, but I am not that patient.

Because I wasn't sure if my first visit was just a \"first time/grand opening impression\" I have gone back a second time - this time after work at night.  My second visit was even better than my first.  Both times the stylists took the time to listen to what I wanted done to my hair instead of trying to tell me what they thought I needed done.  And they made sure I was satisfied with my cut before I left the salon.  I will definitely be back for my future hair cuts!  It also helps that this salon is so easy to get to, has way more than ample parking, and I felt as if I was their most important customer both times I went there.

We understand that this took courage. Often times in a salon environment, when a client leaves the salon the service providers are left shaking their heads and wondering why a client didn\u2019t return. In this case you have given us something invaluable. For that we thank you. Your concern has now given us insight into what we can do to improve our salon, not only for our staff, but our clients.\nWhile we are not new to the industry, we are new to salon ownership, and are always striving for excellence. So, your post will help us in that aspect. We will be reviewing our policies to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen again. Also, while we cannot undo your past experience we would like to extend an invitation to you. After careful thought, we would like to offer one of the following for your choosing.\n1)\tWe do have a stylist here that has a private suite. We can book an appointment with her that will give you a calm and serene environment with full privacy. This will be a free service of cut and color, or manicure/pedicure for you.\n2)\tOffer you a full refund of your last services with us. Simply supply us, via private message, of course, your credit card statement, bank statement, or receipt, and we will promptly refund that to you. No questions asked.\nAgain, your feedback, whether good or bad, helps us to grow and improve! Thank you so much for taking the time to contact us to let us know about your experience with us!

She was amazing!!  Great personality, she kept a good conversation going, and gave a nice looking haircut.  The wash prior to my cut was nice, the lady even gave a small massage before the wash.  You may be wondering after saying all that why I would give three stars?...  Well, I'd suggest bringing in a picture of what you want.  Because my hair isn't anything like what I asked for.  I went in with longer hair and she held up an amount to ask if that's what I wanted cut off, to which I agreed (about half an inch at most).  My hair went from around 3.5 inches to .5 inches.  It's so short I can't even put a part without having my hair just spike straight up.  So, I'm most likely going somewhere today to just have it shaved and start over.  On top of all that, I was told it was around a $20 cut, I paid $32 to have someone cut all my hair off.  BUT, I'm willing to bet if you brought in a picture she could probably cut to the picture with ease.  I kinda hate leaving this review, but I'd rather do this and save someone the stress of going from long hair to short hair unintentionally.\n\nUpdate:  I am reducing the stars.  It would seem that if a person actually cared about their business and a customer had such a valid complaint, they would at least reach out and inquire as to what exactly transpired and how it could be fixed.  I left this review over a month ago and have yet to hear from anyone.  Doesn't seem that they actually care about customer satisfaction, hence the drop in personal rating.  I still maintain that the lady who cut my hair was nice, but niceness doesn't really do anything for a bad haircut, or for a displeased customer who didn't even get an \"I'm sorry\"...... Doesn't look like I will be going back to this salon.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81087090f59b:0xae5d8db163a4d91b"}

So obese to the point to where her stomach was hanging down towards the floor and you could see the skin of her stomach coming out from the bottom of the shirt. Which means no matter how much she tries to pull her shirt down, that stomach still pops right back out under the bottom part of the shirt. The shop was dirty. And the black so called leather couch looked cheap as if it came from the goodwill. They had these knock off purses hanging up on the wall as if for sale. I was instantly turned off by the sight and the atmosphere of this place. So I just showed the lady a really super hard hairstyle that I knew someone who looks like this most likely \"cant do\". Waited for her to tell me she cant do it. And used that as an excuse to leave. I can see why those 1 stars are growing when it comes down to reviewing these people.

Look at the horrible job she did on my wife's hair and take your money and business elsewhere.  Despite explaining and showing pictures of what she wanted, my wife received nothing close to what she asked for.  The cut is much shorter than what she wanted, by 4 inches at least and isn't evenly cut.  The color is wrong and not blended at all.   When I called and asked for a refund, Kelley laughed at me.\n\nAfter 3 HOURS in the chair, my wife called me almost in tears about how she hated her hair.  I stopped by another salon on my way home to buy my wife some shampoo to help wash the color out and showed them the carnage.  They were in shock, they could not believe how bad it looked and that it took 3 hours to do.\n\nI called on my wife's behalf and asked for a refund.  When I did, Kelley laughed at me before emphatically stating that she was not giving ANY money back, nor did she offer to fix the cut.  Not that we'd accept any such offer.  This coupled with my wife's experience has left us the impression that Tallulah's is far from professional.  We're now going to have to pay for her hair to be fixed by a REAL stylist.  Learn from our mistake; no one should need to have their hair fixed, let alone pay for an awful haircut.

Despite the fact that business hours stated that the salon should have opened at 10:00 AM, I ended up waiting until well past 11:00 AM until anyone showed up to open the salon, despite the fact that I had a 10:30 AM appointment myself, and the girl who was waiting had a 10:00 AM appointment.  She ended up leaving around 10:30 AM, but I waited until approximately 11:10 AM until one of the salon managers finally arrived.\n\nWhile this is a one start review, it is not quite so black and white. The manager noted that the individual in which I had scheduled my appointment with had quit his job with the salon shortly after my scheduling.  For that matter, this stylist had not contacted his clients to inform them of the cancellations, and I am currently having to request a refund via the Groupon voucher system.  The manager was very polite in relaying this information, but unfortunately, she did not seem to have access to the scheduled client list, meaning that it was the stylist's responsibility to cancel the appointments to his clients and offer the proper method for requesting a refund on the Groupon.\n\nSo altogether, if you are going to visit this salon, I do not recommend purchasing any vouchers under the name of a specific stylist.  Chances are, this was most likely an odd scenario, and while my rating is going to be a one start from my own personal experience, it probably is not actually a poor salon in itself.  If nothing else, I think it would be wise if the salon were to organize its scheduling more effectively, ensuring that the other stylists are aware of one another's schedules.  Hopefully a situation like this does not occur again, so simply be cautious when scheduling an appointment for this salon, especially if you plan to use an online voucher for it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886215b8daa4b509:0xaf74cbb195f60e86"}

Kelly came around the corner to greet us but looked disappointed when she finally reached the sitting area. She said her name was Kelly and she'd be with us. She left to go into the back. You could tell she didn't want us there. Oh by the way were' black.\nIn walked another worker. Greeted us. Kelly came back around to talk to the other worker. Lots of whispers. My sister and I came early. But sat in silence and I for a moment felt as if I were invisible. No other conversation took place. Other than to compliment my niece on how beautiful she looked.\nMy appointment was at 11:15am. I wasn't shown back to the room until 11:30am. In which Kelly awkwardly showed me to the back. While waiting for her to return back to the room to begin the wax. I loudly over hear someone say \"Hey you might want to get your purse, it's open with all that money sitting out. You don't want it taken\". Did I mention how small the shop was? My sister heard it. We were both offended. At this present moment the only people in the shop were my sister, myself, my niece, Kelly and another worker. Who would have stolen the money? Completely offended.\nThe wax begins. Kelley used a wooden applicator to apply the wax, once she applied it. She sat the applicator on my leg with that wax on the end sticking to my leg. Once she needed the applicator she would remove it from my leg and use the mesh like cloth to forcefully remove the wax. She did that twice. The third time I said \"Could you not use me as a wax holder\", and I pointed to the applicator sitting on my leg with wax adhered to it. She replies sarcastically \"Sorry, I didn't know I was using you as a wax holder\".\nThe wax begins. No gloves, used the applicator multiple times without changing it out. Used the same wax stripe several times. For a master esthetician you would think she knew how unclean it was to double dip with that wax? You would think she knew that you couldn't apply large hot amounts of wax to an already waxed area even if it were to remove a few strands of hair.\nThe wax continues. This was the most painful wax I'd ever had! She had the nerve to tell me it was normal. I've gotten waxed By Spa L in Huntsville and Waxes by Claudia in Charleston SC over a course of three years and I've NEVER had this experience. I've never been so bruised, red and had burns.\nMy final result is horrible. I'm burned, red in some areas, there are sores from BURNING. I'm extremely tender from the BURNS I've acquired. I'm extremely disappointed. Luckily I stopped my sister from having the same experience.\nShe was condescending in conversation, snarky, have extreme amounts of attitude. She was rough, lacked bedside manner, if I did not force conversation she would NOT have spoken to me and I'm not sure what I did to receive any of this? Maybe entering her shop? Lesson learned. Just because someone is on groupon doesn't mean it should be purchased. Worse experience ever. I would NOT be shocked if I have folliculitis.\nI did ask if she had Yelp. I wanted to record my experience. She asked if I were going to give a bad review(because she's gotten a bad review before but didn't dignify it with a response). I lied and said no, only because I didn't want further bad service from her. But frankly I wish I had read her yelp page prior to going. It would have saved me from waxing burns.

I asked would I need to pay for a full set ($350) where I usually paid $85 and was told yes. This is a prime example that no matter how fancy your establishment is or talented your employees are, customer service still matters to some. I haven\u2019t went without lashes in literally a whole decade, I don\u2019t mind paying that amount but I think as a regular customer who came monthly, tipped well, arrived on time, and even had conversation during this period with the esthetician, the $265 was worth sharing.

I had one long piece of hair left. I spent 7 years of no heat, no unnecessary products, just for my hair to grow 6 inches. So when it was finally long I decided to get it the color I wanted. After I spent over $600 my hair kept looking worse and worse so the lady doing my hair said she was going to cut it. I told her I wouldnt come back if she cut it because I just dont trust people and for this exact reason. So she brushed my hair and cut it straight across with no guide or anything. My hair is naturally curly/wavy poofy, you can not correctly cut hair in this fashion without straightening it first. So therefore my hair was cut terribly wrong by an instructor who worked there.\n\nSo my hair before the process is the picture with my hair long and dark natural, the next one with the chunk missing out of it is from her brushing my hair so aggressively she ripped my hair out. She brushed my hair so violently every time I would have piles of hair just covering her floor like a rug. Alittle advice from me would at least treat your clients hair with alittle care, be gentle, or not and end up with hair like mine that is now shoulder length. The last photos are of when I stopped getting my hair done after she had cut it.  If you can see I have one sort of strand of long hair left. It has been about 8 months now and my hair still is the same length(shoulder length ) from haveing to get it fixed. Years, time, money, and hair I will never get back...", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_s6aGCWGRniBoTTEvyM6M1jMyeZ6SUSUCAAvN=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqDr5kNPeos6Ao9vhBRKkP-7IZsraDF0Zuvc05=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuDT2oBe8TO7et9Os7xGzgP41UrAdT7--7D4kO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNeNUYHGJCxmJBzzRd5YSA7JlG5l_jj16-_7u0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4UE3VeYwIMHafzT9FgBzIAJqKS4f_L849WODp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1534690443334, "text": "**RESPONSE PHOTO POSTED IN THE PHOTO SECTION***\nHi, Heidi!

Below is my Jan \u201819 response to your 1 star review.\nI\u2019m not sure where to begin. Your last appointment was in July \u201818 and in 6 months I have not been notified by you of any issues prior to your review just now. We both know your hair had been previously colored multiple times with box color previous to coming into my salon and was nearly black when we began. Your hair was already split on the ends and you refused haircuts at each service. You also applied box color in between your appointments with us which made it harder to achieve your goal. We even sent you home with deep conditioners to help keep your hair as healthy as possible during the process and even did deep conditioning treatments on your hair a couple times in the salon free of charge. Besides the fact that we take photos of our clients hair to showcase our work, we also take photos for situations like this, which I will post here on our google page. The photos can do the talking. We do our best to maintain the integrity of the hair while getting you to your end goal."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889185b6bb0dad1:0x2458751f218bb9d9"}

Had an appointment, arrived to said appointment, was asked if a dry cut was ok since she was already busy with another customer. I agreed....my first mistake.  It was obvious she wanted me in and out as quickly as possible.  She literally took scissors to my dry hair(learned my lesson the hard way)...when she was finished, about 15-20 minutes later, it looked ok, but I did mention that left side needed to be evened out to look more like the right side. She cut into more.....  Unfortunately it was a very bad hair cut.  I went to my friends house and once I started brushing it out and really looking at it I noticed chunks of hair that were longer in the front than in the back, there was a big gap on the right side.....needless to say it looked an absolutely terrible hair cut.  I located another salon within the hour, because there was no way in hell I was going to go back to this salon.  Luckily a local salon/barber shop had an opening.  Amanda, at the second shop I went to, felt so bad for me that she gave me a huge discount, and she did an absolutely fantastic job!   I will never recommend the stylist I used at Bloom.  I do not think this salon is a one star, that was the rating I give that particular stylist.  This salon is very well kept, clean, and the products they sell are decent.

That process resulted in noticable hair loss and I concluded that not only was my long hair no longer an attractive option, but medium length was not going to work for me either. I got a short bob cut but it still was not camouflaging my scalp. I found Ashley and she gave me the cutest pixie cut! I no longer have to worry about the new growth being visible because she was able to create the illusion that my hair is thicker. I hope we never lose her because she is very talented and reasonable.

No one told me this while I was waiting for her to arrive. Instead, I was instructed to go across the street to the ATM. She did have a vague sign posted that she accepted cash or that checks could be made out to her. She did not have any wiring transfer services set up. Those services can be set up in the same time I spent waiting for her to arrive. She seemed to be under the impression that I am here to make her life easier.

Went in today I went in to the salon today after making an appointment.have always put my kids first and haven't had my hair done professionally in years. I came in and was told that they'd be with me in a second. My hair dresser was late and then my name was called and i wasn't introduced. She just walked into the other room.(I wasn't told where to go.) I got to the chair and sat down. She took my purse out of my hands and out of my lap. I guessed she noticed my face when she did that and asked if that was ok. I said it was just never had someone take my purse out from me like that. She asked if I knew what I wanted to do with my hair. I told her I hadn't gone in 5 years and wanted to talk about what would be best health wise to do w my hair w color.she said \"you didn't bring a picture? Or anything? Usually when I sit in a stylists chair I already know what I want to do.\" I said well I thought I could discuss it. I ended up saying blonde highlights. (I probably had an attitude at this point Bc of how she had been toward me.) she hair dried my hair roughly. Then left without saying a word for a couple minutes. Came back and tried ripping off the cape she had on me saying he wasn't doing my hair today. She want use to rude customers... I said she came off very ...she cut me off and said that she was done. I said she was the rude one and went to the receptionist by the door and told them what had happened and one women.(looked like the manager or whatever.) said sometimes ppl don't mesh well but that there were plenty of other salons I could go to. I said \"no sorry?\" ... I told her and the gossipy women around her that I was going to be writing reviews and I left...... Now I have worked in customer service for multiple years and have never been allowed to treat a customer (rude or difficult) in such a manner. I've never had a problem w any other place I've ever been too. Obviously if u want to be treated like you value don't go there.

At the start she assured me the amount of hair I brought in would be plenty but when it wasn\u2019t I made the decision to go purchase more hair. The solution she nonchalantly offered was to just leave the braids down to cover the unfinished part which was near the crown!  She did not secure my daughter\u2019s real hair underneath the crochet braids so several pieces of her real hair would stick out unless we put the hair in a ponytail to blend it in. As if that weren\u2019t enough reason to never return, the shop had a pest problem which the braider did not seem apologetic about and simply blamed on old food.

I was in there from 5:30 to about 10:15. The woman took her sweet time doing my hair while the other woman just sat and watched with a crochet needle in her hand cause I guess She got upset that my boyfriend wasn't gonna come in and get his hair done with me after I apparently told her he was gonna do so. She misunderstood me when I said \"call me on my boyfriend's phone. Mine is off.\" Speaking of which, he butt dialed her and she kept saying \"listen, he's on the phone but not talking!\" She did this 3 more times and im just confused as to why she's calling him back just to hear the sound of him moving around and overall eavesdropping him when she should be doing my hair. Anyways, she acted like she was gonna help out on my hair with the other woman, but she asked about my boyfriend and im just like \"what about him?\" She said he was supposed to get his hair done too and I told her I never said he was, I was just using his phone. After that she sat right down and didn't wanna be near me, acted a bit hateful and gave me looks while I had to sit in a chair for 5 hours for some crochets (would've took much longer if I hadn't have lied and said had to work in the morning and have a 40 minute drive back to Athens. THEN the lady doing my hair FINALLY sped up to regular crochet speed. The other lady eventually came to help finish my hair when it was 30 minutes from being finished. Hair looks great though but after 5 hours, $80, and cutting my crochet hair in half I paid for, (cause \"the hair is too silky so it's hard to crochet\" then \"the hair is too long, it may matt up and tangle\"....two opposing statements there. The hair was 24 inches long and it's the same hair I've always worn and got installed by different people. Never had a problem with the hair being put in the way it is. ) It has no reason not to look nice. Only reason I didn't give one star is cause the hair DOES look great.... service was just lackluster and they had the nerve to ask me to drop them off home afterwards. I didn't. Like I said, I had to work the next day and got a 40 minute drive back home. \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd21", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b84e54e28bb:0x187490cb7edde93d"}

Unfortunately the past few times I have had highlights done, the learning leaders have not led the students well. Recently the student was unfamiliar with highlighting and caused the lightener to \u201cbleed\u201d causing an intense and distinctly different contrast to show up on the root and parted portion of hair. They tried to fix the problem by toning this portion. By toning the hair I no longer had highlights in this portion leaving the hair a reddish dark color on the root in contrast to the blond. They offered to provide additional highlights on another visit but I would still have to pay for the lightener. I was told $13. The next time I came within 7 days to have the lightener done to fix the toned area without highlights. It became apparent the learning leaders only add a small amount of lightener to each extra bowl needed to lighten so they can up charge $13 per bowl. I have noticed this in the past. This time I was charged for 3 bowls. The instructor said these extra bowls were not necessary, however the instructor allowed the student to use this amount.

We appreciate your honest feedback and you're absolutely right-we are a school! Our students are all at different levels of skill based on several factors including, but not limited to, length of time they have been in the program and the specific areas in which they excel. You may not have known this, but we have a 100% guarantee and you can always let us address any issues you might have had with your service. Students work on guests because they need the hands-on experience which is part of their curriculum. Students aren't ready for the salon until they have completed their program, hours, and have taken both their written and state board exams. They are then ready to transition to an actual salon. We also have students who are in a program here we call Phase 2. These students must pass an interview and hands-on assessment in makeup, cutting, color and texture. These \"master level\" students are available upon request and you'll be getting a more advanced, driven student that is much further along in their program. However, these services do cost a bit more. All that being said, we have to remember that we are a school, first and foremost. We love being able to offer extremely low (much lower than an actual salon) prices for our guests because our students need the hands-on experience. We can all remember the first time we tried to accomplish something...sometimes it was great, but sometimes we also had a lot to learn from the experience. But with practice and patience, we got so much better than when we started and that's exactly how it is for our students. We hate that you weren't happy with your hair, but we do appreciate the time you gave our student in letting them perfect their craft."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

I wanted time for it to settle so I went in the end of February, Mal put in a couple hundred foils. I looks very natural and sun kissed and fits what I looked like prior to my hair darkening, it looks much like my daughters hair whos isn't touched by dye. I'm going back next week for my touch up. I can fit a touch up in every 8 weeks or so and get a trim. I do like natural products, argon oil ect and she recommends items outside of what she sells in store. I purchased a no crunch holding gel upon her recommendation and it's been great. She takes a lot of time and effort and her prices are reasonable. Definitely a huge ego boost to have sexy hair. The fianc\u00e9 loves it too.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1555690254723, "text": "Thank you so much for such an insightful review Melissa!

Which is ok being that she called her assistant who got there asap to start my hair. She did not have a large selection of color hair really just the basics and I wanted purple and black braids but opted to get brown and blonde since she had no purple. But her assistant did a great job on the front of my braids even though she was gripping my hair sooooooo dang on tight. At first it irritated me but in the end I guess it helps the braid last longer. Now my hair has been braided for just about 2 weeks and the \"middle\" of my hair looks like it has been up for 2mnths. The parts are not neat at all and they are not the same size as the front.. now let me say the assistant did about 4 or 5 rows across the front of my head, basically from my ear forward.. and the rest Aida did. I have not really done much to the braids except for the basic scalp care but as far as styling, it has pretty much been the same way Aida styled it which was all hanging and a few from the front pulled back into a rubber band to keep the hair out of my face. Now this review is not to bash Aida but I figure for $200 my hair should have been damn near perfect and its not. Her assistant did a better job with the front of my hair; thank God because I am able to cover the middle and back of my braids with the work her assistant did to keep my braids in longer. Like I said she was very professional and courteous but I dont feel that she should charge $200 for the sloppiness of the middle of my hair. I dnt care if it cant be seen its just the fact that I paid you $200 and I expect my hair to be neat, all the same size, and to last. So I dont think I will return to this shop again.

What i got was a pageboy straight across front and back just below my ears. She was in such a hurry I did not get a good look at it until I got home. After I cried. I realized it will take awhile to grow out in order to repair this.  I have gotten excellent service here previously. But not on this day. This is a very bad style on me and the stylist DID NOT LISTEN TO HER CLIENT. I need a frame around my very round face.

I started doing my hair color (balayage) myself after having previous bad experience in Birmingham and Jules helped me remind myself again why I should stick with doing my own hair.\n\nI went to see the owner Jule, that day I arrived right on time for my appointment 1:45pm but she didn't start on me until 2:15 pm. I had bleached my hair prior but was out of toner at home, so I asked her (along with a haircut) if she could apply a glaze to get rid of the brassiness around the mid section where I applied the bleach (I re- colored my balayage, the ends of my Hair didn't really need the toner since they were still at a 10/11 from previous balayage coloring). In the meantime her next client arrived at 2:20pm. So she sat me at the shampoo bowl, applied the violet toner to my whole hair and left me sitting at the bowl while attending to the next client.. 30 min. The thing that bothered me was; SHE DIDNT COME CHECK ON ME OR THE TONER FOR 30 MIN!! After about 15 min I noticed (thank god i had my phone on me) that some parts of my hair turned purple -especially those end parts that were already at its lightest from previous bleaches. So I'm trying to get her attention, but it didn't work. So when she finally was done with her client and all the chatting, and saw my hair at the bowl she was a little shocked too but tried to play it off. She kept telling me it will come out in a few days after a few washes. I told her I don't want to go home like this (especially with Christmas ahead), and asked her if she can put on a second toner (a more natural/ with a little gold in it) to counteract the violet, which she then did. She only charged me for one toner which was nice I guess since she screwed up tho process.\n\nShe has a lot of older, white and local clientele and really doesnt seem interested in new clientele. That\u2019s probably why she only did a half ass job on me. IMAGINE SOMEONE LIKE THIS DOING A COLOR JOB?!?

Appt set for Sunday morning. Gps'd to the shop using from the internet, it took me to a location on centerpoint pkwy. We realized there were two locations. I drove a total of an hour to the correct location and she said she would give me a discount for the inconvenience, when we finished, the discount was only $5. So I get there, Fatou starts prepping my hair and then another girl comes and she tells me she's going to do my hair. This girl.....Quisha....initially seemed high but I found out it's just her personality. She stayed on the phone the entire time with an occasional break from the telephone. The conversation she had was horrible for a customer and boss to hear. Breathing hard on my neck. She took a short cut and braided most of my hair to the scalp when I clearly said box braids not rectangular braids. They over charged me. $180 for semi shoulder length braids that were braided to the scalp. But charged someone else $210 for knotless braids. I wanted a professional braider which is why I chose the African braider with 4.5 Star review. But got this disrespectful, ratchet girl that's only been braiding hair for 2yrs! I found that out after my hair was completed and the girl had left the shop. Then the bathroom.... When you open the door it hits the toilet halfway open. You have to slide in, and it's filthy. I\u2019m 8mths pregnant, there was no way I could hold it any longer.  It was a very bad experience. I recommend Fatou, but not if she's going to pass you off to a disrespectful braider that's only been braiding hair for 2yrs and incapable of giving you what you ask for.  Some of my ends are already unraveling and I've had them only for 2 days.

He got to work, and it took about 45 minutes to an hour. I felt like he actually cared about how my hair looked, unlike my usual experience of seeing how fast they can get you out of the chair. I walked out pleased, knowing I would not go anywhere else. Entirely worth the money. Then, I had to run some errands after.

It looked like I had 3 pony tails sticking out on random parts of my head.     The entire hair cut only took a few minutes and I just don't feel like my stylist paid much attention to doing a good job.\n\nAdditionally, the beard trim was terrible.   I asked the stylist to trim my mustache so it wasn't in my mouth.   After combing it out later that day, there were whole sections that were completely uncut.   Combed straight downward, my lips looked like a barcode where there were random whiskers sticking down.\n\nI understand that stylists have bad days, but when you charge 5 times as much as a standard haircut you expect a higher quality.\n\nThis haircut was much worse than the $8-$12 haircuts I've received in the bast.

Finer finishes that made the salon look like it needed attention.\n\nThe haircut however was great. We had a consult where my stylist Tammy asked about my preferences, lifestyle, and schedule to make sure she could suggest appropriate styles that would look good at home.

Unfortunately, Olivia A. Salon is not the place for me.  I went in for an acrylic fill with gel on top and while everyone was friendly  I left unhappy with my nails.   The result was chunky, overly thick, and uneven.  It looked worse than press on nails glued and painted by a child.  The nail technician did NOT use a drimmel or motorized file but used a foam hand file to take off my existing and layer of acrylic.\nAt first this seemed nice but I was mistaken.  She was unable to file the smaller sectional of my nail bed and ended up filing skin which hurt.  My nails were embarrassing to look at as they appeared malformed and lumpy.  When she applied the gel she used 3 very thick coats of color that didn't dry under the light and were soft to the touch.  To be fair, I'm picky with my nails and when I saw the manicure going south I didn't say anything.  I should have.  Instead I left and went straight to another nail salon.  At the next salon they showed my Quasi-Modo nails around and laughed.\nThe salon itself is easy enough to find but the level of aesthetics is less than what I like.  They clearly want to be a high end salon but the quality is not quite there.  In addition, the prices were NOT worth it!  They charged $10 over what any other salon does.  The people were nice and they fit me in.  And I want to make it clear, I did not say anything to the lady.  But I'm not sure that she would have been able to fix them even if I had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b80bb327d0d:0x763a472c8ef66bd8"}

She also was on the phone most of the time talking about how soon she could get off so she definitely didn\u2019t spend a lot of time on me cause I also wanted at least the layer put back in since I have fairly thick hair and she just uneavenly tapered a few strands in the front.

We strive to make everyone happy, but sometimes, in rare cases, we just can\u2019t. This is one of those cases. Your appointment was reserved for 1:15-2:00. Originally, you were booked with another stylist, but due to a death in her family, you were asked if you\u2019d like to reschedule with her or move to another stylist. You chose to keep your appointment time and change stylists. The stylist today only had that small window of time open before her next client was scheduled to arrive. Our call log shows you called at 1:27. You talked to the receptionist, who gave you directions, and then you entered the salon at 1:36, 21 minutes late. Our haircuts start at $40, the shampoo and style is just an added bonus. The stylist offered to still cut your hair, but only having 24 minutes left of your appointment time, she could not fit in the complimentary shampoo and style. We do not discount services for late arrivals. We are sorry you had trouble finding our salon. If you had called earlier, we could have given you directions to prevent you getting lost in the mall. Again, I\u2019m sorry you think we were unprofessional, but our hands were tied and we could not have done anything else to make you happy in the small amount of time we had to work with."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888a9519c904443:0x8c155c0a457a3458"}

Just asked if it looked ok with a horrible attitude, I didn't have the nerve to tell her that she butchered my hair. I have never felt more uncomfortable getting my hair cut.

I also wanted it styled because it's my husband's work Christmas party tonight. Now is when it was obvious she wasn't sure what to do. Granted, my baby fine hair, which I don't have alot of, is tough to style. But after her attempt at several curls, I pointed out that without adding some type of product,  my hair would not hold curl. At all. So then she started using some hairspray & it did help some. She was attempting to use a brush to comb out the curls, the manager finally walked by and handed her a pick to use.. for about the next 10 minutes, the manager stood and watched from several feet away. Clearly, she was trying to figure out what the girl was trying to do.. finally, she came over & showed her how to add volume at the root without having to tease my whole head.. it turned out ok, I wasn't super thrilled with it, but I was just ready to go after almost an hour.

Chelsea Loeb removed \"Reviews\" from her Facebook page, \"Vanity Hair Studio at Sola Salons\", @VanityHairStudio88, where her mother decided to intervene and childishly berate me. I didn't want to have to do this, but since the BBB in Northern Alabama closed my case as \"Unresolved\", because she didn't reply, as usual, so I have to take to social media to tell the Facts so this can't happen to anyone else. I sent this to BBB & posted a Google Review & will continue to post to make others aware! Chelsea Loeb has scarily moved on to jeopardize the business, \"Sola Salon Studios (a.k.a.Vanity Hair Studio at Sola Salons), but EVERYONE should be warned!!!! 2&1/2months now My hair had teal/green streaks that was NEVER requested & now the streaks are fading to a rusty color. She said she would fix her mistake & ceased communication when the messages clearly showed \"Read\". Original hair plan, ALL OVER blue/black \"PERMANENT\" hair color. Then Chelsea spoke of some \"Pre-lightening\" streaks. Wasn't too sure what that was, but entrusted she knew what she was doing since I told her my \"Original\" hair plan. 1st Salon appt, 4/23/18, Chelsea only touched up grey roots on top half of head & \"Pre-lightened\" streaks & dyed them teal/green!! I asked for ALL OVER permanent hair color, not just partial roots, & did NOT ask for TEAL/GREEN! Chelsea then processed a 3rd color on my hair within 3 hours, to cover up her first mistake. After 3+ hours there, it was supposedly \"fixed\". Knew it wasn't, but after 3 hours, I was done. Reached out to her the next morning, 4/24/18, to have it fixed before our beach trip the following day, 4/25/18. Chelsea then supposedly applied a \"permanent\" all over color, what she called a blue \"Fantasy Color\", & was told to rarely wash my hair so the color wouldn't fade. I know enough about hair color that a \"permanent process\" should not \"wash out\" in showers. Unfortunately my nightmare came true. Ruined friend's linens we visited whilst on beach trip. Couldn't swim in Resort pool or at beach because blue was pouring out in showers & is was \"washing out\" 38 days later. I paid for \"Permanent\" color, not \"wash out\". Returned from beach trip & respectfully asked her for a refund on 4/30/18, since what I paid ($135) for was not remotely done. Chelsea replied, \"Unfortunately we don't issue refunds since the time & product spent...\" So I asked for it to be fixed \"again\" since I did not ask for the teal/green that's showing again since her 3rd color is \"washing out\". The same day, 4/30/18, Chelsea agreed she would once she returned from her beach trip. 5/7/18, I asked her what brand of \"Fantasy Color\" did she use so I can figure out how to get this color out for good for I was tired of ruining my own towels & linens. She replied the same day with \"Pulp Riot\", but didn't offer any other advice, considering she messed up my hair. Of course I followed thru and researched the product, only to find out that it \"Washes out in 42 washes...\". As stated before, I paid $135 for a \"Permanent\" hair color process. That same day 5/7/18, I asked if she could fit me in the following week to correct her mistake. No reply. One week later, 5/14/18, I messaged again to see if she can get me in next week. Still no reply. Most insulting is that the messages let you know once they've been read & Chelsea has \"read\" them, and still no reply. I don't want her touching my hair in fear she will ruin it more. I just want my refund so I can go elsewhere that's more professional & knowledgeable to fix HER mistake. Insult to injury were her Facebook posts during the 2 weeks I was requesting her to fix her mistake. She was clearly telling the Facebook public that she had openings. Why not reply to my requests to fix her mistakes?! Filed a BBB complaint May 14, 2018, & she had until May 31,  to respond. No reply. Then had 10 days to respond. No communication until 2nd BBB letter. My pictures and her complete disregard of her own negligence is proof enough on her lack in professionalism and customer service & is UNacceptable! Still \"UNresolved\"!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzpuxeK1gKssill30F3zN2G-Vu3eYqb4mNG5h6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDP-mppzw37dZ0_jO53RTTaf6ETiF1xH088V-P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY_jlo02Pe3p6jsETwL8_LwpU3GCuNX1oRZwa-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrTi10Ft7_pp91jPWI_GO_REM10mflIC8RDyWE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvYQuRQbXJunDGWzIDFkl5Tn98OCydO_Tg9qBk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTHb-dWVDmJ70hk86S4yIqe8WP5RjxJ30O7ClE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZM15k8yFZxsd4HvWduJPdx4TPRk1P8aNjHhg8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuMtwTAsXF_yhNv-PxzU5uRLJsykaK0K_JB2ju=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ccbcb1ea25f:0xb4e505e0d474933f"}

I gave them 3 because several different times I've had appointments with my stylist and they will call to reschedule for whatever reason ( which I understand) but have somehow lost my rescheduled appointment and for me the drive is 30 min each way, I have even taken off work to be \" fit in\" only to be told I dont have an appointment that the salon called me to schedule...its a bit agitating to say the least. They have lost my entire haircare profile more then once and even had me booked as an entirely different person.

So my recomendantion is always ask to make sure the person who is going to do your hair has the time to do it because I had been waiting this long for this appointment to end up not getting anything done due to the lack of her time, but yet my friends hair stylist did not have any issues and was super sweet and friendly and he did everything he could to keep me content!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a5872c4ff39:0x1886f90554e80156"}

I have lived in different cities- including Birmingham- and currently live in Montgomery\u2014and still go back to Mobile for Studio PH on a regular basis. He\u2019s just the best. He has done my hair for for every special event including my wedding day, and he will continue to do my hair on a regular basis. In the field of personal service, I cannot offer a more effusive endorsement than Phrankey and Studio PH.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d9b56c3c40d:0xd18d86e74b2cd46f"}

Since Tiffany chooses not to advertise, you might say she's a hidden treasure, in a way.  But as with all hidden treasures they eventually get discovered and it's no different for Tiffany.  The Local (about town) publication had their annual voting for Most Liked categories and Tiffany got runner up for favorite hair stylist in the Columbus/Phenix City area!  I recently sat in Tiffany's chair for the first time.  Haven't lived in the area for a long time and needed to find a hair stylist and I lucked up and found Tiffany. She is immensely talented and her prices won't break the bank! A huge thumbs up!\n\nUPDATE!!!! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!! My first review was 10 months ago and I  no longer see Tiffany.  The last two times I was scheduled for a cut Tiffany did not show. She did have Bobbie there to cut my hair, but it was totally unprofessional to not have called me in advance to let me know she was unable to do my hair and to ask if I was okay with her sister cutting me or allow me to reschedule.  The first time this happened I was fine, since Tiffany was down with Strep, however, the next time nothing was said about her being sick.  I'm sorry but that's just plain rude. I have also been very disappointed in how she has handled others I have recommended to her. This does not appear to be the professional salon that I first thought it was or something has seriously changed. I will now give it only 1 star.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553813875351, "text": "Oh my goodness, Mrs. Trina this is seriously the sweetest review I haven ever gotten!! Thank you!!

{"user_id": "103804845592874345668", "name": "Tera Shade", "time": 1393167773078, "rating": 5.0, "text": "In response to the \"1 star\" review written 3 years ago.  I responded 2 days after it posted but it never showed up, so I'll try again with my response...When this review was first posted the person included her name (it has since been changed to \"anonymous\").  I called the reviewer and inquired about her time spent at Bliss.  You see, I am the owner and very concerned about our reputation and our guests experience.  I believe the following information will help you decided if you want to take this reviewer seriously.   Let me begin by saying this reviewer called late in the day to make an appointment to have her hair cut.  Even though we were booked until closing time, one of my stylist agreed to stay late and take the appointment.  The two employees behind the desk greeted this reviewer, offered her something to drink, and informed the stylist of her arrival.  Because it was now after closing time, the two front desk employees left for the day.  This reviewer was not left alone or ignored at any time.  The stylist who volunteered to stay late, finished with the client she was with and was on time for this reviewers scheduled appointment.  This reviewer had her hair shampooed, had more of a trim than a cut, and blown out.  She was charged $15.  Her comment about being charged three times what she should have been charged... Well, I don't know where a woman can get her hair shampooed, cut/trimmed, and blown out for $5.  She did say she was new to the area, so maybe she could get the above service done for $5 where ever she moved from...Just to be clear, Bliss does not offer shampoos, haircuts, and styles for $5....  I noticed she did not mention the amount she was charged.   Could it have been she as embarrassed to admit that she thought $15 was \"three times more than what it should have been.\" Because this reviewer posted this review under her name and because we had her phone number on file, I called and inquired about her time at Bliss.  I stated I was the owner and was making follow up calls with our new clients.  I did not  mention I had read her review but instead asked how she enjoyed her visit with us.  I gave her every opportunity to relate any unpleasant experience she might have had.  I was told that Bliss is a beautiful place and was thanked for taking her appointment on such short notice and after hours.  When asked how she like her hair cut even thought it really was only a trim, she responded \"I like it, she did a good job.\" During our conversation, she never said anything negative about her visit at Bliss, and when I invited her to return in the future she said she would.  To be honest, she has not returned .  I wish she had given us another chance so that she could experience what Bliss is really about.  I would also like to respond to the comment about the service being done half-hearted and with no conversation.  The stylist's mother had just passed away very unexpectedly two weeks earlier.  She was still mourning her loss but trying to live as normal as possible and continue to work and support herself.  While this reviewer had no clue what was happening in our stylist personal life, I think because of the comment she made in her review for all to read, its important for you to know why our stylist was not her usual outgoing friendly self.   I am very interested in making each client feel welcome and appreciated.  I personally follow up with as many clients as possible to make sure that their time at Bliss was relaxing and that they are satisfied with their service.  I know this has been a lot to read, but I wanted to give a little more information about the above review.  I am sure I am not the only business owner that is willing to go above and beyond what is normal to make their guest happy.  If something is not what you are expecting, please let us know.  Give us the opportunity to \"fix\" it.  Our guest are the reason we even have a business and we understand that, without \"you\" we wouldn't be here.  We look forward to seeing you and making you feel \"special\" like the person you are!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d61a6391ccb:0x7321ebb76dd3fc84"}

It had been years since she had been treated to a girls day and so today was a special girls day where we could get our hair cut together. We live in Florida and wanted to spend some time in Dothan visiting our favorite shops. We booked an appointment and scheduled our day around town. My mom was so excited when she sat down and explained what she wanted. Instantly the stylist scowled and said \"I'm gonna let you know now... your hair is not going to do that\"  My mom has had this particular cut before and explained that it was okay and that she wanted this cut. The stylist did not wash her hair at all before tearing into it with scissors. The entire appointment the stylist complained that he hair was \"too thick\" and did not stop complaining about how my moms hair \"just wouldn't cooperate.\" At the end of the appointment, my mom did not receive the cut she wanted at all, it was a jagged uneven cut. My mom had beautiful long hair and now the cut was so short that even if she wanted to have it fixed at another salon, it would turn into a pixie which is NOT what she wanted. For me, thankfully she didn't botch my hair like my mom but still she was rude and complained that my hair was \"just as thick as my moms\" I already have a pixie so there wasn't much she could mess up on thank God. At checkout, the stylist even scowled at the fact that i was paying for my moms cut along with my own! as if its unheard of for a daughter to treat her mother on her birthday! Needles to say I left a small tip to be nice because the cuts were not that expensive but honestly i shouldn't have. My mom was so upset that night when we went to dinner and did not feel confident :(", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889292726d9c00c3:0xd19c2276df0a2aa2"}

Unfortunately, what you described above was not what actually happened. As I tried to explain to you and your mother, you had layers of dark brown/black box color all over your head. My main goal is to always keep the integrity of our customer's hair in great condition. We could have easily blasted your hair with bleach and a high volume developer in an effort to remove the dark box color. However, that runs a much higher risk of damaging your hair. Instead, we chose to start with Redken's Pre-Art treatment. This treatment removes all types of things from the hair including, minerals, products, and some artificial color. It also helps to ensure that we get the best possible results from any coloring service as it helps to create a 'blank canvas' on the hair. We did that treatment on you twice, and then brought you back to the bowl to start with a 'soap cap' on your ends. A 'soap cap' is a mixture of bleach (lightener), shampoo and water. This allows the hair's integrity to also be maintained as it starts out much less aggressively removing color from the hair. It was during this process at the shampoo bowl that your mom inquired about pricing. We told her that all our color correction services start at $150/hour. She made the statement that you are 18 and booked the service online without knowing what correct questions to ask. She said you thought you would be able to achieve the blonde hair you wanted on a half price color day, so the total would end up being somewhere around $75. I am sorry for the misunderstanding. Going from a dark brown box color to a light blonde, while maintaining the integrity of your hair, is not a cheap process. It requires time, skill, knowledge, patience, and realistic expectations. Your mom said she would simply prefer to pay for the Pre-Art treatment and the soap cap and you would just leave 'as is' because you didn't want to pay the price for the full service. We never told you that you couldn't achieve the result you wanted. In fact, we told you that we absolutely could get you there! But it would be a process. You are not alone in this process. Anyone who has ever had dark colored hair and eventually achieved light blonde hair can empathize with you. It's not easy, and it's certainly not a 1-2 hour process. Trust me, if I could wave a magic wand and get you there I would. But it's my responsibility to you, as a customer, to do it the correct way and make sure you still have hair on top of your head by the end of it. I am sorry that because of a misunderstanding or miscommunication that it made you want to rate my business negatively on google. My customers are very important to me. I apologized over and over before you left to both of you and tried to explain this process and why it was so important that we do it the right way. I hope this helps to clear up any confusion about what happened on our end. I want you to be happy with your hair, and I want to help in any way I can. Please feel free to contact us and I will work with you on getting your hair color to where you want it to be. As I was more than willing to do at your initial appointment. Take care!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88893ff6535421f5:0xe467b9c2cd19892e"}

First of all I have long hair, I wanted my split ends off and layered along with face layered. All she did was a face layered and split ends, and then she took a big round tool for the hair dryer and tried to curl up my hair, when I got home, my husband looked and they burned some of my hair so not only was my hair the same, just a snip here and there, but it stayed frizzy all the time, no matter what I did it would still frizzy. So I finally went to options in my town and they did my hair right. My mom went the same day I had mine done at Walmart, this same place. The girl who did hers, was suppose to cut her split ends off and layer it. She did 2 snips on 1 side and the other side and she was done. Then they changed their prices from 15$ (for a wash and cut along with druing) to 20$ for a wash, cut and dry. It's still 15$ for a cut and wash, but you will have to go around with wet hair because in order to dry, you have to pay 5$ more. Oh but they don't tell you that at the counter BTW!! Wound up paying almost 45$ for mine and my mom's hair cuts. They would not refund either. So I could have let my 10yr old niece cut my hair way better than those people and saved 45$. I will never go back. I suggest to anyone else, if you want to goto your salon who does a good job, but decides oh I'm at Walmart, I'll just do it here, don't!

It is a locally owned, very modern, super stylish, extremely clean salon! Upon entering, a temperature check was performed by the receptionist, everyone was wearing masks and offered masks for a tiny fee if you didn't have one handy, that was very very important for me to see, as I didn't have the same experience with another hair salon. Then I was walked through an onboarding process, showed around and given a welcome kit with referral cards, discounts and a loyalty discount card, which was a very nice touch! My stylist asked a lot of questions about how I wanted my hair cut and styled, asking me along the way how everything feels, if I wanted adjustments and so on. I was recommended an extra treatment, which I agreed to and it honestly made the experience even better! My hair looked full and super healthy, so I trusted that it was a great recommendation from my stylist Madison! She was very helpful along the way, recommending any products she thought I could use, and advisi g against others that wouldn't work for me! I ended up using my welcome discount to purchase a kit of products from a line I already use and it was a really awesome deal in an upcoming holiday box!

I've seen a couple other stylists back in Denver, and my hair wasn't done as requested/described or as shown in reference photos. My \u201cplatinum blonde\u201d would come out a darker blonde, a rose gold color, or as a more \"natural blonde\" (as my last stylist's shop partner described my platinum appointment's finished product).\n\nMeagan listened to what I wanted, reviewed the photos I sent her as reference, explained her process to me and how she would ensure the right color, and even worked in a couple more services for me (tinting and shaping my eyebrows). She also did a pH bonder (included in the cost of the service; no EXTRA cost), which made me happy because it'll help strengthen my hair after this platinum card process\u2014 AND it's better than Olaplex! My hair feels soft and healthy, and I'm so pleased with what I learned in my appointment from Meagan as well as the level of service I received. She also helped direct me on some products to help my fine hair better cope with this humid Alabama climate while I'm here.\n\nThis color is what I've been asking for and paying for from others, and I finally got it here at Meraki.

It should be discussed about how much it will be when you are describing what you want to the stylist while she is evaluating your hair. And if its too high, then a different affordable approach. I'm not educated in this field, so I have no idea what steps have to be taken or how much those steps are, such as the $150/ hr. that I was charged. I was told differently on the appt. call.

Please have your sister contact us directly. Every lash removal is charged for a lash removal.

I would like to speak with her so I can find out who misconstrued that information to her to cause such confusion as both of our Guest Experience Experts that handle scheduling, know that it is a service that always costs since it requires proper training and techniques to not compromise the client\u2019s natural lashes.\n\nThere a multitude of factors that go into lashes not lasting long. And in this case, your sister, I\u2019ll withhold her name too for the reasoning you stated, was informed for the beginning that she had short natural lashes - and going as long as she wanted to go could lessen the amount of time they would last. Getting them wet at all within 24 hours and proper at home protocols not being followed will also shorten the time.\n\nAll of this is explained at the appointment as well as some of it is notated on the waiver signed in the beginning of the appointment.\n\nAgain, please have your sister contact us directly so we discuss ways we can properly rectify this situation with her. Thanks!\n\n***edited to add: I see she was already refunded a FULL refund for her full set 4 days ago. I\u2019m not sure what else we can do to rectify this situation more than we have.

I've had my hair lightened before, and there was always a period of super-dry, frizzy straw hair that took weeks of deep conditioning to recuperate. This is not the case now. My hair doesn't even feel like it's been colored at all. It's just as healthy as it was from the start. Also, I now get complements on my hair E-V-E-R-Y day. That's never happened to me before!

Staying at the residence inn, I Googled best barber near me, and Robert Henry popped up first. Took a look at a few reviews and then booked my appointment online for just a few hours later.\n\nRobert Henry is located inside the Sola Salons community of beauty care, which is a series of suites that are rented by different beauty experts. Walking into the solo suite, I was met by Robert who was gratious and welcoming, as was his work space. Very clean, with a modern feel, Robert started with a brief consultation, asking me what I was looking for, as well as assessing my hair's style. He made some brief suggestions and offered up a bottled water and then we were off.\n\nI signed up for the business cut. From moment one I knew I made the right choice. Shampoo, a little massage and then he dives right into his craft. Robert was talkative and engaging while never being overbearing, he had a comforting chair side manor, and walked me through what he was doing, like a play by play.\n\nHis style is precise and you know, even if you can't see, that you are being treated to a Great haircut. Once he had finished with the overall styling, he conditioned and treated me to a warm face towel. Man, what a touch. A brief scalp massage and then he popped me back up, applied some product and I get the glimpse of the final product. It is Amazing. He shows me the back, where he tiered it a little more in the lower section, remembering how I told him that section grew faster than other spots. Love the attention to detail.\n\nI highly recommend Robert Henry. I have a pretty wild mane, curly in spots, straight in others and some pretty crazy hairlines, and they were no match for this amazing stylist.\n\nMahalo & Namaste,\n\nmpgink", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528226036488, "text": "Welcome to Birmingham Matthew !!\nThank you for your feedback.

I had already booked my hair stylist for my wedding so I planned on using this giveaway for my bridal shower. I immediately called when I won and scheduled an appointment. I called the day before my appointment to confirm everything because it seemed to good to be true. When I called they did not even have me on the books. Luckily, I was able to schedule an appointment for the same time. I asked how I needed to come in with my hair and they said that I didn't need to do anything. When I came in they gave me a book of hairstyles to choose from. They also gave me a glass of champagne. When the hairstylist started on my hair the owner came over and told me that I would not be able to have my hair and makeup for free because it was not my wedding day. They only wanted to do the giveaway so that they could have professional pictures with the hair and makeup. This should have been said before I even sat down in the chair.  She claimed to have called me several times but I never received a call. I decided just to get a blowout because my shower was in 2 hrs and I was not prepared to pay $200 for something I thought was free. My wedding planner called the owner while I was getting a blowout and explained how unprofessional this was. The owner came over to me and started asking me questions about where I was going and my wedding. She explained to me that my wedding planner was very rude to her but she was willing to comp my blowout. She came back a few minutes later and said that I could have my makeup done for free as well. This bad experience did turn out to be a good experience in the end and was handled correctly. Although, I did not appreciate being constantly reminded how rude my wedding planner was as I got my makeup done. My hair was a little frizzy and I did have to touch it up. The makeup was good but I would not use them for any other event and especially not for my wedding.

It was supposed to be for Saturday. When I booked online the system refreshed and when I had originally chosen Saturday it re-selected Wednesday. That part was my fault because I should have double checked. The issue I have with Blo Blow Dry Bar was the way that the woman on the phone spoke to me.I had asked her if there was something that could be done as their cancellation policy states that if you don't show up to your appointment they will charge you for the full amount and you have 24 hours to reschedule or cancel. I had made the appointment after 5pm on Tuesday so I wouldn't even have had that opportunity to make changes based on the policy. While speaking to the receptionist on the phone she was looking into whether or not there were other appointments available on Saturday. Then all of a sudden another voice came onto the line. I believe it was the manager or owner. I explained the situation and asked her some questions, I was not rude or ugly towards her. Her response to me was extremely rude \"I've explained this to you and I have a client and there is nothing we can do\" and then proceeded to hang up on me. I can understand that you have a business but to treat a customer like that is uncalled for. I will take some of the blame but I never did anything to be yelled at and hung up on. If that is how you treat your clients that are coming in from hundreds of miles away to pay for your services, then you don't deserve to call yourself a business.\n\nUpdate: They called me yesterday afternoon asking if I would like to make an appointment for Saturday. After you treated me that way you think that calling to schedule another appointment in which I would have to pay again is appropriate? Then this morning I get a text message asking how my experience was and if I could rate it.

Like I had mentioned on phone repeatedly, that you had an updo and makeup request on a Wednesday, for which we got a MUA and stylist that specializes in these areas. We have appointment email sent to all guests when they book, which has date and time of the appointment. Our cancellation  policy is also attached to appointment email.  If we would have gotten a call on Tuesday when you mistakenly booked or even Wednesday early, that the appointment was booked by mistake, we would have definitely accommodated. No doubt about that. But on no show, we called you, explained our policies and the situation, and had to charge. I stayed on the phone quite a bit explaining repeatedly that I had specialists called in just for you,  and after that I did have to go and politely excused myself. I did not hang up and that would be rude if I did, but I did not. I apologize if it felt to you that I did and did not explain the policy well. I tried my best on my part to make sure I repeated and clarified there was nothing in this case I could do as I had to pay the stylists as well.

I\u2019m just curious to know if she ask everyone that ridiculous question. Pretty sure she does not ask that dumb question. If you are a hair stylist you know how to do all hair textures. When I arrived for my appointment the first thing the receptionist tells me if it takes over two hours to do my hair it will be an extra $20 (wait what). Nowhere on the website it says anything about paying extra if it takes over two hours. Like I said before do you tell everyone that it cost extra if it takes over two hours. On another note Desirea made me smile from ear to ear because she is extremely professional and made my hair look beyond gorgeous. I return again just because I was beyond happy with Desirea and her professional manner. Hoping to return to see Desirea again in the near future because she has amazing set of skills with doing hair and being professional.

I was tired of always having an afro so I originally was googling Brazilian blow out when I came across Blo. I loved the pictures and how they do things so I thought ok I'll go here. I set up the appointment for that afternoon and once I got there, I was like OMG it was hard to find parking tho so I parked at the hotel adjacent to the shop. I went in and the receptionist was so warm and friendly. She checked me in and asked if I wanted something to drink but I declined. I waited a couple minutes longer than expected but I understood because it was pretty busy. I was greeted by my stylist Faith and she was so friendly too. I wanted to go to sleep when she washed my hair OMG it felt so good. Once all that was done and she started to straighten my hair, my first thought was omg is my hair really that long. It was as is her flat iron was working magic on my hair and when she was done and I looked at it I almost cried I felt so beautiful. My hair was so soft, long, and I just couldn't stop running my hands through it. She did an amazing job.\n\nI'd highly recommend Blo.

Every time I would go get my hair done I would think I sure wish Laura Beth was still doing my hair i missed her. My husband started looking for a new job and we found out we were moving to Newnan,Ga. I started thinking, I wonder how far she is from where I was moving to. I got on Mapquest and it was 76 miles. I didn't care, it was worth every mile I drove for her to be doing my hair again. Ambiance is a very nice place and everyone there is very friendly. I met the owners that day and they are really nice. You won't regret going to Ambiance and getting Laura Beth to do your hair. Best decision I ever made to drive 76 miles to get my hair done. Worth every mile.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2a4abcfaa7f:0x1a22706a7f3ee147"}

I was very nervous and she told me she could fix it back if I was not satisfied. So, she did my hair and it looked nothing like the photos I had shown her. In fact, it was the exact opposite. I did not get mad, I simply asked her to fix it back, as she had promised. Instead of agreeing to fix it back, she had the audacity to argue with me. She then proceeded to grab my phone from my hand and scroll through my photos because she claimed she was shown a different photo (which she was not). I am upset that my first salon experience resulted in my hair looking the exact way I repeatedly said I didn\u2019t want it to look but I am even more upset at Kandy\u2019s unwillingness to help me.

I showed them the picture and neither said they could achieve the simple braid and curl. they explained that the stylist I was scheduled for had called in, but I was not informed of this until I had already made the 45 min trip. They had nothing they could do for me and I was shoo-Ed away. Will never be going back.

I called Harlow on recommendation and in one sitting Lydia fixed it, plus she didn't charge me an arm and leg for corrective color. One of my favorite things about Lydia is that I tell her what I want to do, she listens, and does it. And when I give her free reign because I trust her, I am never disappointed. Not to mention she's hysterical and a pleasure to be around. After having a friend do my hair in Louisiana, I thought I'd have a hard time finding someone I loved as much in Mobile but I was wrong.

I did tie it down everyday. Didn\u2019t exercise. The ponytail broke in half after 3 days and the swoop moved everyday. The stylist Kierra put glue all over the bundle so, I can\u2019t reuse it.

I have gone over records of your past services with us back in July, and we never charged you to redo your hair. After the initial service, if our clients are not happy with the outcome or the color did not take to the hair as is what happened in your case, we are happy to take care of any charges in the future until your hair is exactly how you wanted it. The initial color charge on July 18th of $105 covered the product used on your hair to achieve the balayage highlights you asked for. We had to bleach your hair from the solid black color you told us you had done at a different salon. You agreed and understood at that time. You came back on July 19th to add more balayage so that the red you then desired would show up, and you left happy. Then finally on July 26th you came back to add even more red. You were not charged for either of those services on the 19th or 26th. We have records of this if you would like the proof. You left on July 26th happy with the outcome. We are so sorry to hear you feel \"ripped off\" a few months later as we truly tried to do everything we possibly could to make you happy with your hair without destroying the integrity of your hair.

It sticks up on its own and is so uneven you can make out gaps.The woman who did the original hack job mentioned that we needed to update his note in his file to reflect how we wanted it cut. We have been customers at this store for years with the same notes and never have we had a problem before.

The personality and communication skills of Arian do not qualify her a job in service sector. Definitely not a manager, if she is one right now as she self claimed.\n\nI have been going to this place despite of a bad experience 2 years ago with a stylist before. At that time,  I averaged my rating at 2 star. But now, I wish I could give 0 or negative rating, and will not go there anymore despite of the convenient location.\n\nI believe this place can still survive only because its location is very convenient for students. I went there in a morning in March, I was told they didn't take walk in. Understandable in covid. I made an appointment at 2 , then I went back at 1:50, and waited for 40 minutes, and finally sit on the chair at 2:30, and got the 10 minutes hair cut. Then I apparently complained to the stylist that the so called appointment didn't work.\n\nHowever, I forgot all these, until I was reminded by the same stylist yesterday in May.  When I saw she didn't have mask on yesterday, I asked if she had vaccine.. she said no. Then I asked why she didn't have mask on if she didn't have vaccine. Then, she told me she refused to serve me anymore because I complained last time as well. I didn't even know what is the last time and who she is, then she showed me the ticket, which shows her name ARIAN for my last visit. And told me what happened last time. I wanted to talk to the manager, she self claimed to be the manager while wagging her head and proudly laughing at me.\n\nOkay, she won. I walked out and went to another place and fixed my half done hair.\n\nIsn't it part of managers job to handle customers complaint? I know many of us at our jobs need to pretend to like our boss.  But since when it becomes a responsibility for a customer to pretend to like the service even if they don't? Ok, I have been there for 15 times as the ticket showed.  Out of 15, I do remember 2 bad experiences including yesterday. Plenty of okay and good ones.

When I looked for myself at the back obviously it was straight across almost a frown, the opposite of the cut I had requested. She argued at first then admitted that to fix it she would have to cut off a lot of my length.\n\nWhen I asked where her restroom was, because I had made a long drive and waited past my appointment time, she told me that I would have to go across the street to Subway. She suggested that I could walk. I had come in with a walking cane because I am handicapped and I was carrying an umbrella because it was raining. So she expects Subway to provide our restroom. I drove while I waited and bought a cookie because I didn't feel right using their restroom for nothing.\n\nI think she would have been capable of giving me a good cut for a decent price if she had wanted to. But she didn't try. I am very disappointed because I am looking for a new good hair dresser for a good price.

At any rate, I was on my way back from Atlanta this past Saturday, I called hoping for an appointment, and fortunately -he was able to squeeze me in.  I have not had a decent hair cut in a year.  He did his usual perfect job AND took care of the gray - perfectly.  Everyone in that place is friendly and outgoing.  The stations are cool antique dressers and the place is really nicely appointed.  The only critique I have is the 'baby poop' colored alcove.

I wasted $200, 6 hours of my time in total, as well as my long natural dark brown hair that I had to shell out more money for to get a box dye to fix the mess. Same goes for my friend that got a 'balayage' at this salon, which also came out terribly and more like full-head highlights than anything. We both saw two different stylists in two days at this salon AND the owner (5 employees in total, probably half of their salon), but in the end our hair was still horribly colored and extremely damaged.\n\nThe cherries on top:\nWhen I got home after the first visit, my scalp was on FIRE from whatever product they left in my hair for so long. Due to this, I doubt their products are as safe as they say they are.\nThe second stylist that I saw also didn't even know how to brush long hair and was just brushing top to bottom maniacally like she never brushed hair before, ripping through any tangles I had. This isn't the biggest deal but it does represent the carelessness she had for causing breakage. I've never been to a salon where the stylist didn't even know how to brush hair correctly.\n\nIt may seem like this place is top-notch with the really good reviews but to be frank with you, I would not be surprised if the majority of them are from friends/family/actual employees that work there. It also seems like the pictures they post of girls with dark hair and highlights look brassy/orange.. Not sure how, but we missed that red flag.\n\nIf I could give this salon advice - get better lights so YOU and your clients can actually see what's really going on with their hair before you screw it up one too many times. In addition, make sure your 'level 4' top employees can at least brush hair before letting them go wild with the permanent dye.\n\nThink twice. Odds are you will probably leave this salon and have people asking you, who did it and what for?", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFG0JMpEJWXhbV4hn-NwEsGl0LJs2abW8fm8Bu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cc8fe28f09f:0xe184333cc4ee678a"}

However, she wasn\u2019t going quick enough so my stylist quickly sent her away and haphazardly finished my blow out. The stylist acted standoffish the entire appointed and I instantly regretted not leaving when I could have. Because of my hair thickness and length, an appointment usually takes about an hour. I was in and out in 30 minutes. When I checked out, the stylist told the receptionist in an annoyed tone that I had really thick hair and walked away. I felt like I was a bother to her.

The staff are nice but the quality of my end result is horrible. I ended up with very cheap looking orange/brassy hair that looks like I got it done for $50 instead of the elegant looking nice ashy brown cool toned balyage that I wanted. For starter, my friend and I booked an appointment for a cut and balyage. I had Gabby as my stylist and I showed her an image of the balyage I wanted. After she was done, she basically just gave me highlights that ended up looking horrible since it looked very orange/brassy....not only that, I was also told that she did not even cut my hair the way I asked her to. My friend and I gave them a call to tell them about our concerns and they scheduled us to come back the next day to do a color correction with stylists that are more experienced. I was given Hannah as my stylist and I was told that she have about 10 years of experience.  She told me that she was gonna re-do my supposedly balyage and correct my strong orange highlights that was going from my roots to my ends since I emphasize how much I wanted that smooth transition of balyage. I showed her an image of what I wanted my color to look like (same image as I showed Gabbie). Hannah managed to fix my haircut and smoothen out my roots to give me the smooth transition, but the color of my hair was still very off...I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the lighting in their salon that made my hair looked better when I was there since my hair looked like it was chocolate brown after Hannah was done....\n\n.....I came home and I washed my hair the next day. I dried it off and saw the color....I still had the same color that Gabbie gave me and it was still VERY brassy and orange. I am so mad because my hair now looks horrible and I have to go to a different salon to get it fixed since it seems to me that none of the stylist here knows how to deal with very dark hair....I didn\u2019t want to leave a bad review for this salon since everyone seems very kind and sweet but I have to warn you if you have dark hair and is trying to get a balyage or any other color.....this might not be the place you would want to go to. You\u2019re better off going elsewhere.\n\nI attached an image of the balyage that I asked.\nI also attached a picture of what my hair looks like after Gabby did my hair and pictures after Hannah re-did my balyage.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cc8fe28f09f:0xe184333cc4ee678a"}

It\u2019s not rocket science.... going from dark brown to blonde is a process. Oh and when you go home and wash your hair in Pantene, don\u2019t be surprised when your color fades.

I was told before we ever visited that the hair stylist and the barber were the best. And it was no lie. The fades and the cuts that The barbers do are just crazy and amazingly on point, all the way to the owner himself! I never been a barber or hair salon that all the barbers and all the hair stylist are amazingly just good down home neighborhood loved people who make things happen in a good ole fashion way to just get the job done continuously making all customers happy with their hair dues BEFORE getting up out of the chair, also BEFORE being paid! OMG!! The owner out of nowhere served us a chicken sandwich better than Popeyes's death chicken sandwich. I will continue to bring my business here at Black Pearl's like no other shops exist here in Huntsville Alabama.! Neisha is our stylist and my daughter's sew in looks great!!!! She took her time nurturing the hair style as she would go, never seen anything like it, very impressed. The owner had a short cut he did on his customer, you would have thought he was presenting that style for the Red Carpet in Hollywood. Anyone who reads this review should go by and check out Black Pearl's and you're not going to be disappointed that you drop by. I dare either of you to visit  one time, I promise you'll be hooked like a fish from a home raised pond. Everyone if you're looking for a great stylist, the best barbers, and overall great environment where people just treats you kind of nice but no reason, please give Black Pearl's a try, j promise you will be happy you did. My daughter and I are over the top satisfied and not planning on going anywhere else as long as we are in this town of Huntsville AL.

A shellac manicure and regular pedicure bc I am traveling to cancun for vacation. All I can say is it was a disaster. After three hours my nails look worse than if I had done them myself. I asked the technician before if the colors I picked in gel and regular polish were similar and would match. She replied of course and began my manicure. Without applying any cuticle cream or softener she began digging in my cuticles while chatting up all the employees and barely paying attention to what was going on. She continuously had to keep picking at my cuticles after applying the gel and all of the polish looks uneven with streaks and lumps. Finally she did all she could to fix my manicure and started on the pedicure. After she applied the polish and I got up my jaw dropped to see bright red on my toes and salmon on my fingers. She quickly began attending to another client without much else to say to me. I checked out at the front and even tipped 20% of the pre discount amount bc I believe in paying for a service but I definitely will never be returning and will be warning everyone I can contact to stay away from this salon.

I wanted box braids (crotchet braids), now me and my daughter had lo\u00e7s so everyone may not know how to do it in our hair that's why I called first. So they washed our hair and proceeded to start then, with the guidance of the lady in charge decided to not do what I asked, said they had a better, quicker, and easier way. So I said ok y'all are the professionals, or so I thought. Once done it was not what I wanted but I had no time to change so we paid and left. The amount of braids she put in our hair left our head so heavy and I could not even put it up in a ponytail, which I specifically told her I wanted for both of us (a up bun actually). So I went the next day for them to take a lot of the braids out of my hair so I can put it into a ponytail, she did, but I still couldn't do the up bun I wanted. But the day (a week later) my daughter came home from school with her hair looking like the pics I have below I was fed up and called to receive a partial refund.

The paper work that you signed at the beginning of your service, explains that if you are unsatisfied with your hair, your stylist will be more than happy to come up with an arrangement to get your hair where you would like it to be. We truly wish you would have come to us first so we could evaluate your hair and make it right for you without the additional costs of another salon. We have offered for you to come in and have us take a look at your hair to evaluate the situation, and we are sorry that you did not want to come in to work this out. Unfortunately, due to the time your stylist spent with you, product used, and not having the opportunity to evaluate your hair in person, we are unable to refund you for this service. Upon reviewing your paper work, your stylist noted that your hair would need more than one service to achieve the end results that you were wanting. This is due to the fact that your hair was already previously lightened at home before your visit to us. We are always striving for what's best for our clients. In this circumstance, your hair wouldn't be able to handle any further lightening in one visit. It is our understanding that in order to protect the integrity of your hair, you and your stylist decided to go with a darker blonde until your next service. We aren't quite sure what happened between the time you left the salon and now, but after your service you told us that you loved your hair and even booked your future reservation with us. We deeply value you as a customer of ours and we are sorry to see you go. We appreciate your review and we hope you have a wonderful day."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a61f96ea20655:0x14238b725edd250"}

I have gotten amazing work before and have loved it. This time ruined everything. The ladies in there are nice (Alix and Kacey specifically). I went in a week and a half ago and I asked for silver all over hair. (Up to the root) Kacey was my stylist and because of some previous bleachings, she and the owner Kacy determined that doing a shadow root would be best for my hair. I showed her some pictures and she said they could do it. I got finished and I had a blonde balayage with some silver tone.(very minimal if any at all) I got finished and I didn\u2019t care for it because it\u2019s not what I asked for but I didn\u2019t want to hurt my stylists feelings. It was 350 dollars after tip. Which is overpriced but I\u2019ve gotten good work before so I didn\u2019t mind too much.  I went back later and set up an appointment to get it redone. I spoke to alix and she said they may charge me again which i didn\u2019t mind if It got done the way I wanted it. Then the hurricane happened and they had to reschedule my appointment, which was done over text. I ended up just going to the salon to request my money back because in the texts with the owner (Kacy) she said that Kacey (my stylist who had previously done my hair, didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that color silver. I showed her the same exact pictures  I had when I was in the salon before she touched my hair. If she would\u2019ve told me that instead of me wasting my time and money, there wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. I walked in the salon understanding that doing hair is trial and error. I ended up having a discussion with the owner, who tried to convince me numerous times through rude and disrespectful language that I left with silver and their \u201cnot magicians\u201d. Kacy is the rudest and most unprofessional business owner I have ever met. She doesn\u2019t care about the customer. She cares about the money.  She is disrespectful and will do whatever she can to assure she keeps her money, even though she has wronged someone. Do not go here and support a terrible business owner.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600989492355, "text": "Cassandra, this is really unfortunate.

We were not going to charge you for your appointment that was tomorrow. I even went out of my way to text you products that would help the silver stay better. You and your boyfriend came into the salon and your boyfriend was extremely loud and rude. I will not put up with that in my business. We were trying to make you happy and that obviously could not be done. I am sorry you had this experience. We tried to make you happy. You had an appointment tomorrow. Also, Kayce was not comfortable re-coloring your hair that had just been lightened to platinum. So we were putting you with a stylist that was more comfortable with doing your color.

I lived out of state for school, and would plan my visits around when I could come to The Masters. Even now, with me living in Nashville, I would schedule well in advance to make a trip to this salon so I could see my favorite hair stylist, Rita. As someone with curly hair, it takes me a long time to find someone who has the skillset to work with curl patterns. I have had many bad haircuts in my life\u2014anyone with curly hair can relate. Rita changed the way I worked with and styled my hair. I even recommended for my mother to start visiting the salon because I wanted to refer her to Rita. Recently, Rita told us she was moving out of state and that she would be referring all of her clients to Kimberly. I trusted the salon, and so I scheduled my next appointment.\n\nKimberly has a great disposition. I explained I didn\u2019t want to deviate from the shape that Rita had left, and I only wanted it a little shorter because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to be back for a long time. Kimberly asked me if I wanted for her to cut my hair either dry or wet, because \u201ccurly haired girls always have a preference\u201d. I told her I would be okay with what she was most comfortable with, and she decided to cut my hair wet. I noticed she was cutting it in large chunks and not taking her time. When she was finished, she asked me how much product I wanted in my hair because \u201ccurly haired girls are particular.\u201d After she put it in, she separated my hair into clips and said she was finished while she pulled out the diffuser. As she plugged it in, she looked at me and said: \u201cDo you want to diffuse it yourself? Curly haired girls usually like to do this part themselves.\u201d I was taken aback because this has never been asked of me before\u2014especially by a place that charges almost $100 for a cut. I told Kimberly that, sure, I could diffuse my hair myself. After I was finished, I looked at the result. The hair fell like a triangle; she easily had cut off 4 inches. I quickly paid and went to my car. I decided that I couldn\u2019t leave a place that charged so much to do a substandard job. I pulled up a picture of my hair after I received my last cut, and went back to the salon to see if it could be fixed. When I came back and showed Kimberly the picture, she was apologetic. I sat back down in her chair, and she proceeded to ask me to tell her where I thought she should cut my hair to make it look right. If I could cut my hair myself, I would. But I cannot, and that is why I spend more than $20 to go to a place that emphasizes professionalism and a higher skillset of stylist. Seeing that I was just going to have to leave with a bad haircut, I left.\n\nI called management to ask for a refund. My mother had given me a $50 gift card and I had put the rest on my credit card. They told me the owner was out of town and that they couldn\u2019t refund my money without his saying that it was okay. Instead, they offered me two haircuts. I explained that, although I appreciated this gesture, I wouldn\u2019t be returning to the salon to get my hair cut again. They insisted that it would be okay and that I should go to the stylist who trained both Kimberly and Rita in cutting curly hair. When I declined, they said they would try to talk to the owner. A couple of days later, they returned my phone call to say they had not heard from the owner and they still suggested I take the original offer. I had no plans on going back, but my mother has straight hair and usually has no problems when it comes to getting it trimmed. I asked if I could transfer my two cuts to my mother, seeing as she had purchased the gift card and it was also her money wasted on a bad cut. I would feel better knowing that she could do something nice for herself. But, they said no. I never heard back.\n\nI had to write this for all of the curly haired girls out there who \u201care particular\u201d or who have a \u201cpreference.\u201d Do not come to this salon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1566598422101, "text": "Hello Brittany, first off if this was to happen to one of us or a member of our own family, we would not be happy.

When I came in and asked for something different the manager and son of the owner stepped in and decided to do the formulation and process himself. This man is considered to be extremely good with color. My hair came out neon orange when I asked for dark brown. He then tried to fix it the same day and it was still very very wrong. At this point I had been at the salon for seven hours. He then asked me to come back that Saturday for an \"adjustment\". I came out of that no better and my hair was damaged and breaking off. They also still charged me $450. I have never gone back. I also witnessed failure of management on managing clients and appointments. Brett has set up the salon where clients are passed around to whoever is free to work on them. So what you can expect is someone else possibly starting your appointment and another stylist finishing at. I experienced it myself and with other clients and it not only frustrated the clients but their stylists and employees themselves.

At first I really thought I was at the best salon in Huntsville but I asked for specific different kinds of colors in my hair even showed pictures and after I was finished my hair was all one color there is no dimension at all also prior to my visit I asked for someone who knows about curls to style my hair because I have naturally curly hair I was given the impression this would be no problem but what I found is what I've experienced at so many salons before the stylist looked at curls as if they were all the same and used products that were too heavy for my hair and left my hair feeling gross and stiff the style was absolutely awful I found myself not wanting to even look the staff in the eyes and holding my head down walking out the door because I was so embarrassed by the way my hair looked. My job pays me to look good and I couldn't even walk into my work place feeling confident (which is one of my favorite things about getting my hair professionally done the \"confidence boost\" you have after)  I research beauty and hair consistently I guess because of this I felt like I knew more about what needed to be done to my hair than the staff which I should not be able to say because they have had actual schooling in this. I could have done what they did myself and it probably would have looked better not to mention this all costed over $200 my usual stylist has been fully booked for some time now so I thought I would try someone new not only is the outcome with her phenomenal and EXACTLY what I ask for every time but she also costs half the price.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1482178905911, "text": "Dear Alexzandria,\nThe Masters places a very high emphasis on each and every guest receiving the very best of what we have to offer.

As a full-time working mom, I don't get a lot of free days and have been waiting anxiously to have my hair fixed by another salon. This was my experience:\n\n1. My stylist was very nice and friendly. However, she didn't actually listen to me. I went in wanting a cut and highlights. I explained the same to her twice. When asked whether I had ever colored my hair before, I told her I had balayage and that I was considering getting it again at a later date. I showed her a picture of the color I wanted and she misinterpreted the photo and decided to ignore all the instructions I had given her in her excitement to give me a balayage. When I realized her error, she was already two straps of bleach into my hair so I decided to go along with it since I had planned a balayage later on, but it does not change the fact that it was NOT what I asked for. Which leads to the next point.\n2. Six or more strips of bleach into my hair she confesses she never did a balayage before. I have been to many professional salons and the stylists have always been really open about their experience, or lack thereof. This information should have been given before she even touched my hair, not when I was left with no recourse because my options were only to stay and bear it or leave and have my hair ruined by the bleach. Instead, I had to undergo more than 5 hours of clumsy coloring at the hands of someone inexperienced with some oversight from other potentially more trained stylists.\n3. She did not properly cut my hair. I have a lot of hair with a lot of volume, which I explained from the off. I requested layers but did not see her cut any and, if she did, did not do it properly. My hair was honestly not well cut and this might also have been due to inexperience as another stylist actually showed her on my hair how to cut my bangs, the only passable part of my cut outside of the length. After more than 5 hours, the last thing I wanted was to push back when it was just me and her and I just wanted to get home.\n\nThis leaves me with a really terrible experience and with waiting for a more experience stylist at another salon to fix my hair, which is so horrendous I barely take it out of a ponytail.\n\nAdvise to management:\n1. You are a salon, not a school or institute. Train your stylists and have them be upfront about their experience level, or lack thereof.\n2. Learn to be apologetic instead of having secret meetings about how big of a screw up this was.\n\nAdvise to stylists:\n1. Train on your friends, not your paying customers, and be upfront with your customers before touching their hair. We should get a say on what happens to our hair.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626bfde97e4fff:0xf1e5f5371c14243"}

She also took a photograph of a previous hair style she wanted to be sure to avoid. Before her appointment she informed the lady who set up the appointment that she wanted a wash a color a highlight and a cut.  The price quoted was reasonable and a bit more than $100.\n\nWhen she got there she informed the beautician that she wanted the back of her head to look more like an inverted bob and less like a wedge.  She was told that a bob and a wedge are all basically the same and that those haircuts have many names. She then told my wife that she would do a custom haircut for her because the photograph of the style she wanted may not look good on her.  My wife agreed so long as the back looked like she wanted, full and rounded.  After the color she informed my wife in the shampoo chair that she was going to add a gloss to lock in the color.  Nothing was mentioned about extra cost and where we come from, that gloss is part of the color process and built into the price for a color and highlight.\n\nMy wife got precisely that haircut she did not want, a wedge, and not even a good wedge. The left side has a gap that was as large as three of my fingers and the back is insufferably short.  The bill was over $170! And that's after they pulled a few things off of the tally after she mentioned the initial quote.

If the beauticians there are so wonderful, why can't they listen to the customer and give her the haircut she wanted?\n\nIn addition, it appears that the prices online and the prices in the shop do not match.\n\nwe thought about asking them  to make it right, but you can't put hair back on.\n\nMy wife will never darken their door again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626bfde97e4fff:0xf1e5f5371c14243"}

My oldest son (3years) has always had issues with haircuts due to past issues with ears and medical procedures. We saw Dawn on Saturday and it was hands down the worst experience ever. She was not caring or patient with him at all. She huffed and puffed and was mean to him throughout the entire rushed haircut.

As with many children he didn't really care too much for the clippers. But Sam who was cutting his hair was EXTREMELY patient with and also worked quickly to get the experience for him over with. She also did a FANTASTIC job with the haircut. I was VERY pleased with the outcome! Not to mention when we were cashing out I left my phone sitting by the register when we left! Now, my son's appointment was on a Saturday. We live all the way on the outskirts of Leeds. Right after his appointment we ate at Panera, came home & took a nap straight away. That's when I FINALLY realized I'd left it! By then they were closed! And they're closed on Sundays as well! So, I had to wait ALL THE WAY 'til Monday to call and make sure it was there! AND IT WAS! They'd kindly put it up for me until my fianc\u00e9 went to pick it up! Such kind, respectful, professional individuals! Also, Dawn (hope that's how she spells her name\uf914) was the one I spoke with on Monday as well as being there when my son had his appointment. Sorry it's such a LONG \"review\", but it's just MINE and SON'S experience. And I felt as if it needed to be shared. ESPECIALLY if kids are involved. Most parents want to make sure they're taking their child/children to the right place. Anyways, THANK YOU so much for the AMAZING experience and your kindness and professionalism!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919456b4651db:0x6e011e83f0b396e3"}

I rarely get my hair cut because of bad experiences and this just added to it. I gave two stars because the lady who cut my hair was super nice and the environment was inviting and clean. However, the haircut I received was awful. I brought a picture of the style I wanted and what I got was NOTHING like the picture I showed her (keeping in mind that I had super long, healthy hair... plenty enough to achieve the desired look). The stylist (Brooke) took all of 5 minutes (maybe) to cut my hair. And she didn't dry it, so I couldn't really even tell how it looked until I got home and dried it. Besides being nothing like what I asked for, there was a section of hair to my right in the back that was about 1 1/2 inches longer than everything else. I guess you get what you pay for :( . Worst $15 I have ever spent. (This review is not to bash the stylist or salon in any way. This is my honest review. I was this lady's last customer of the day, which shouldn't matter... I still should have received a decent cut... but maybe she was in a hurry to get out?)\n\nI made it clear that the cut I wanted was the circled picture. The first picture is what I showed the lady.

I did not like that she did not ask about what styles I wanted or what outfits/colors I'd be wearing when she did the styles. On my wedding day, I requested she use a purple lipstick (subtle, not dramatic), but she went with a bold pink color instead. The hair she did for my wedding was nothing like she did for the included practice run. My hair started immediately falling down during my engagement photos, I told Chika my concerns when I came in for my wedding hair and she assured me my hair would hold all day. It did not. People were constantly having to add new bobby pins to my hair, despite Chika's promise. I also didn't like how obvious it was that my hair was covered in hairspray.\n\nDiana Langseth: My husband and I have been using Diana for our regular hair cuts and eye brow waxing. I feel that she doesn't understand what we want, despite specifically telling her the problems were having. She also could do a much better job when it comes to waxing men's eyebrows. She's very nice, but unfortunately, she doesn't seem to give us what we want.\n\nLisa Davis: Lisa did my underarm, full leg, and Brazilian wax before my wedding. She was very nice and chatty throughout and told me what she was doing and what was and wasn't going to hurt. However, she did not wax the upper portion of my thighs for my full leg wax and I had to go back over spots in the underarm and Brazilian wax, as well. She also finished a full hour before expected, which I wouldn't have minded if I hadn't had so many problems with my results.\n\nKatie Ung: I saw Katie to have my nails done for my engagement photos and wedding day. I really didn't like the shape she did with the french tips. She did not offer any lengthening solutions (if that was the problem) or recommend another style (if that was the problem). I went straight from my nails appointment to my engagement photos and I made Katie aware that was the case beforehand. At the end of my appointment, I told her there was white all over my fingers. She said it would come off after a couple washes at home. I was very unhappy I had to go to my photos with this on my hands, because she had been sloppy with the polish.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597805713362, "text": "OMGoodness Becca, I'm so sorry at no point during your multiple visits with us we're you happy with our work.

She's even called and talked to my previous stylist back in Kansas to find out what methods work best on my hair, which is temperamental about holding color.  In fact, with my last visit, I was her last appointment of the day (on a Friday....right before she was planning to go on vacation) and she stayed late with me (after almost everyone else had gone home) to make sure that the red highlights that I requested were the right intensity.  She ended up putting on a different volume of glaze that made it pop just the way I wanted!  I love that she's willing to hang with me through all of my crazy requests and if I tell her that something doesn't look quite how I imagined it, she works with it till we get it the way I want it.  And, if I try a style that is new for me, she walks me through the steps to style it and maintain it.  Like I said....the best!  The salon is great too.

Today, they were booked so I decided to use their licensed esthetician, Shelly, assuming she would do a good job due to her job title and professionalism of her coworkers. I asked for a clean up, no shaping or thinning. Initially, I thought they looked fine but once the redness calmed down and I saw clearer in my own mirror, the horror set in. First of all, my once thick eyebrows are now basically one single file line of hair because they are so thin. But that isn\u2019t the worst part. The worst part is that they were waxed so heavily in the middle that my eyebrows now sit 4 fingerbreaths apart from each other. They were waxed at no angle, so they are essentially chopped straight off mid way from the middle, drawing a line from the middle of my eyeball up. I am completely embarrassed and to make matters even worse, I was having them waxed for my engagement photos coming up in 2 weeks that, needless to say, will have to be delayed. I cried the whole way home. If I return, I will only be seeing Rachael or Phyllis, but it is a high likelihood that I will never go back.

Salon comes off as welcoming and friendly - \"complimentary\" neck massage.  I use complimentary loosely as I'm not sure if I paid for it or not.  I never saw an itemized bill.  I just know that I was there for 1.5 hours and got all of a ten minute haircut (that's being generous).  Total came to $55 for what amounted to a 1/2\" trim and sloppy bang cutting.  No layers (even though layers were discussed).  Stylist hardly spoke at all during entire appointment and I walked out with extremely flat hair with a cowlick in bangs that also have a big chunk that wasn't faded into the overall cut.  She made me feel like I was taking up her time as she had another client in the color room, so I felt uncomfortable and rushed.\n\nWhen you get your hair cut, you should want to hit the town because you have hair that's only possible after a day at the salon.  I wanted to go straight home and wash my hair to try to regain some movement and style.  Three weeks out and I'm still unhappy and can't wait until I can get my hair cut again - at a different salon.\nI should note that I emailed the salon that afternoon to complain about my experience.  On Monday I received a voice mail offering to make things up to me.  I was so upset I didn't know what I wanted to do (I did NOT want Tori touching my hair again and felt very disappointed with the whole Tonya Jones experience).  Made the mistake of waiting two weeks to call the salon back - haven't received any other calls.

Not only did the prices continue to rise every single time that I walked through those doors but my hair was completely messed up by the staff (as well as Tonya herself). The day that I went in to have my hair colored was a day that I could forsee myself running late ahead of time. I called and spoke with Tonya herself who told me that it would be ok and to just come on and she would get my hair done. I even stated to her that I would be at the very least 30 mins late. She still stated that was ok. When I arrived 28 mins late and I announced to Tonya that I was there (due to no one being at the front desk at that time) she stated that she already had another customer and that I could see one of her lower tier'd hairdressers. I never like to change hands when it comes to my hair and this story is exactly why I don't.\nI was very upset that Tonya told me it would be ok and when she found a higher paying customer she ditched me. However, I decided to go ahead and see her next in line hairdresser who she stated was trained by her and exceptional.\nThis hairdresser placed the bleach on my hair and after many many minutes I walked up to Tonya to ask if it was time to have the bleach removed. Tonya was irritated and told me that he would come to me when it was ready. Another amount of time goes by and I once again try to find someone to take the bleach out of my hair. After several attempts to have the bleach (foils) removed I was told that the hairdresser had went home! Yes that's right....went home!\nTonya had to call him and have him come back to take the foils out of my hair and to wash the bleach out.\nWhen everything was done and my hair dried, I felt how brittle and dried out my hair was from this session. I mentioned it to Tonya who stated that it was all perfectly normal and to use the \"purple shampoo\" when I wash my hair the next day and all would be fine.\nThe next day I did as asked and my hair started to break off in a very big way! I ended going back to Tonya to trim my hair and I asked her to only cut 1/2 inch off the bottom of it. She cut MANY inches off and my hair was no longer long, nor was it healthy any longer. I was truly angry!\nNot only did Tonya make me pay for my bad bleaching session which was over $350 but she also made me pay for my horrible trim.\nI will NEVER go back to this place as long as I live! I have continued to tell others how bad I was treated and how bad my hair was when it was all said and done.\nIf you want good service than you will want to go to someone who can give you that. Tonya's salon was not kind to me.
