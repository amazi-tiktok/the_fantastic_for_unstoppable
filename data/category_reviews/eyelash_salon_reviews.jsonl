I got a full set of silk eyelashes at their soft opening and have received two fill ins since. It has been great every time. Kionte is amazing and really precise and particular at making your lashes look how you want them to. I have been blown away by the customer service here. The salon is clean and professional. They offer a monthly membership which saves me $50/month since I get my lashes filled in every two weeks.  I would highly recommend.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621344dde59601:0xdabac423c3bec61c"}

No new nails were put on today and I left with the same tips that I came in with.  One girl came out to look at what the menu said the price should be, and admitted to me that it was wrong.  I stood there waiting to be refunded $11 and the manager hands me $2.  I left at that point because $9 is not worth arguing about, but made it clear that I would not be back.  They rely heavily on acting like they don't understand English well...and get away with it because most don't bother to see if they were charged the correct amount,  and just blindly hand them their card and sign.

Chelsea Loeb removed \"Reviews\" from her Facebook page, \"Vanity Hair Studio at Sola Salons\", @VanityHairStudio88, where her mother decided to intervene and childishly berate me. I didn't want to have to do this, but since the BBB in Northern Alabama closed my case as \"Unresolved\", because she didn't reply, as usual, so I have to take to social media to tell the Facts so this can't happen to anyone else. I sent this to BBB & posted a Google Review & will continue to post to make others aware! Chelsea Loeb has scarily moved on to jeopardize the business, \"Sola Salon Studios (a.k.a.Vanity Hair Studio at Sola Salons), but EVERYONE should be warned!!!! 2&1/2months now My hair had teal/green streaks that was NEVER requested & now the streaks are fading to a rusty color. She said she would fix her mistake & ceased communication when the messages clearly showed \"Read\". Original hair plan, ALL OVER blue/black \"PERMANENT\" hair color. Then Chelsea spoke of some \"Pre-lightening\" streaks. Wasn't too sure what that was, but entrusted she knew what she was doing since I told her my \"Original\" hair plan. 1st Salon appt, 4/23/18, Chelsea only touched up grey roots on top half of head & \"Pre-lightened\" streaks & dyed them teal/green!! I asked for ALL OVER permanent hair color, not just partial roots, & did NOT ask for TEAL/GREEN! Chelsea then processed a 3rd color on my hair within 3 hours, to cover up her first mistake. After 3+ hours there, it was supposedly \"fixed\". Knew it wasn't, but after 3 hours, I was done. Reached out to her the next morning, 4/24/18, to have it fixed before our beach trip the following day, 4/25/18. Chelsea then supposedly applied a \"permanent\" all over color, what she called a blue \"Fantasy Color\", & was told to rarely wash my hair so the color wouldn't fade. I know enough about hair color that a \"permanent process\" should not \"wash out\" in showers. Unfortunately my nightmare came true. Ruined friend's linens we visited whilst on beach trip. Couldn't swim in Resort pool or at beach because blue was pouring out in showers & is was \"washing out\" 38 days later. I paid for \"Permanent\" color, not \"wash out\". Returned from beach trip & respectfully asked her for a refund on 4/30/18, since what I paid ($135) for was not remotely done. Chelsea replied, \"Unfortunately we don't issue refunds since the time & product spent...\" So I asked for it to be fixed \"again\" since I did not ask for the teal/green that's showing again since her 3rd color is \"washing out\". The same day, 4/30/18, Chelsea agreed she would once she returned from her beach trip. 5/7/18, I asked her what brand of \"Fantasy Color\" did she use so I can figure out how to get this color out for good for I was tired of ruining my own towels & linens. She replied the same day with \"Pulp Riot\", but didn't offer any other advice, considering she messed up my hair. Of course I followed thru and researched the product, only to find out that it \"Washes out in 42 washes...\". As stated before, I paid $135 for a \"Permanent\" hair color process. That same day 5/7/18, I asked if she could fit me in the following week to correct her mistake. No reply. One week later, 5/14/18, I messaged again to see if she can get me in next week. Still no reply. Most insulting is that the messages let you know once they've been read & Chelsea has \"read\" them, and still no reply. I don't want her touching my hair in fear she will ruin it more. I just want my refund so I can go elsewhere that's more professional & knowledgeable to fix HER mistake. Insult to injury were her Facebook posts during the 2 weeks I was requesting her to fix her mistake. She was clearly telling the Facebook public that she had openings. Why not reply to my requests to fix her mistakes?! Filed a BBB complaint May 14, 2018, & she had until May 31,  to respond. No reply. Then had 10 days to respond. No communication until 2nd BBB letter. My pictures and her complete disregard of her own negligence is proof enough on her lack in professionalism and customer service & is UNacceptable!

It was bad. I let it grow for about two months and decided it was time to try another hair cut.\nI found reviews of Rachel's work online and they weren't lying. She was awesome! She amazingly fixed my hair and made it look better than it did before my horrible cut. She couldn't fix all the short layers this time but was able to blend them so they were not noticeable while we wait for them to grow more. Couldn't be happier!

I will return, but with more salon price educated.I wanted to be a deep red color, and it was achieved in 3 hrs. The only thing that I found upsetting after I was sooo very \ud83d\ude0a with the hair, was the total! $600!! Now,  the total shouldn't be a mystery while you are getting it done. It should be discussed about how much it will be when you are describing what you want to the stylist while she is evaluating your hair. And if its too high, then a different affordable approach. I'm not educated in this field, so I have no idea what steps have to be taken or how much those steps are, such as the $150/ hr. that I was charged. I was told differently on the appt. call. That was all the cash I had, barely enough to tip\ud83d\ude12.

She got there and after getting her lashes done they charged her even though they promised her before booking the appointment that she wouldn't be charged! plus her lashes didn't last long. She's not going public with this because of her high status in her company, but I'm glad people like me and her friends can express her disappointment in this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1579929011466, "text": "Hey Oneal. Please have your sister contact us directly. Every lash removal is charged for a lash removal. There has never been a time when our lash artists have approved not being paid for their time to remove a client\u2019s lashes. I would like to speak with her so I can find out who misconstrued that information to her to cause such confusion as both of our Guest Experience Experts that handle scheduling, know that it is a service that always costs since it requires proper training and techniques to not compromise the client\u2019s natural lashes.\n\nThere a multitude of factors that go into lashes not lasting long. And in this case, your sister, I\u2019ll withhold her name too for the reasoning you stated, was informed for the beginning that she had short natural lashes - and going as long as she wanted to go could lessen the amount of time they would last. Getting them wet at all within 24 hours and proper at home protocols not being followed will also shorten the time.\n\nAll of this is explained at the appointment as well as some of it is notated on the waiver signed in the beginning of the appointment.\n\nAgain, please have your sister contact us directly so we discuss ways we can properly rectify this situation with her. Thanks!\n\n***edited to add: I see she was already refunded a FULL refund for her full set 4 days ago. I\u2019m not sure what else we can do to rectify this situation more than we have. I would still like to hear from her though who originally told her there would be no charge. Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x886267a5d761a8e3:0xda004ea8eefc3e37"}
