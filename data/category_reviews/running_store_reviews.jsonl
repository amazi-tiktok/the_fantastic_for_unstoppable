So I came to Running Wild to get some quality running shoes.\n\nI was greeted by Jeannie when I walked in the door.  She asked if she could help me and I asked her if she felt up to the challenge, she said \u201cSure.\u201d  I explained my situation and goals, and she had me sit down and take off my shoes and socks so she could get my true size and evaluate my feet (for over/under pronation, etc).\n\nShe brought me 3 different pairs to try on, and I decided on the New Balance 860v11 which felt fantastic!  She also recommended a pair of socks which would suite me better than ordinary cotton socks which I also bought.\n\nThis was a much better experience than I\u2019d ever had in any of the running shoe stores in Birmingham.  I can\u2019t wait to get started training in these shoes.
