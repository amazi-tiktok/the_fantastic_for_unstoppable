It was excruciating, to say the very least. My usual dentist could not see me in an acceptable amount of time, and I was also traveling to Birmingham for school daily-- about an hour and a half drive, one way-- so I begged the internet to help me find a dentist who could pull a tooth of a horribly anxiety ridden terrified patient who might look like an adult but retreated into toddler status when confronted by dental tools, and one who I could afford, as I had no insurance to speak of. They overwhelmingly recommended UAB dental school clinic, so I called up the emergency dental clinic and begged for an appointment asap. They got me in the next day, but were not able to provide me with any kind of ballpark estimate for the procedure, which I already knew would be a complex extraction on a molar and would require nitrous and a calm provider. It was actually kind of rough dealing with their administrative staff, both on the phone and in person. I realize these people see patients from all walks of life and a lot of them are scared, in pain, broke, and in need of a compassionate ally. The office staff was not that ally for me, unfortunately. I arrived for my appointment, filled out paperwork, and proceeded to wait about three hours before I was seen, which I understand is normal. I was already crying by the time they got me into the chair, but my student provider was really, really kind, and she held my hand and talked to me and distracted me with ridiculous jokes until I could calm down a little. She examined my mouth, then the area of complaint. She wrote down what she thought the treatment plan should be to address the problem, and took it to her supervisor dentist and he did a quick exam and approved it. She started with the numbing shots which were actually the least painful numbing shots I've ever had. That shocked me! And y'all, before I even realized she was done with the shots, she had my tooth snatched right out of me!! I did not even have to use nitrous! It was the fastest extraction I've ever had, and I've had A FRIGGIN BUNCH. That part of my experience was phenomenal. They hooked me up with some antibiotics and sent me on my way.\nMy bill ended up being$300+ for one extraction. If I'm being honest, I've paid less than that at private dentists that were a whole lot closer to me. That part wasn't so great, as I'd been led to believe this was a less costly alternative to private dentists.\nOverall, a good experience, I would return for like routine cleanings, and am considering taking my daughter to the orthodontic clinic. I currently need extensive work done, I need bone grafts and implants and all kinds of awful stuff, uggggg, but I hesitate to say I'm comfortable going here only because they were not transparent about pricing, and that matters for me. I would consider a free consultation, but I don't think they offer one, just a heads up.

After 3 hours of sitting waiting and X-ray I was taking up stairs to oral surgery where I waited 45 minutes. Once I was in the back the assistant (she was very nice) came in and took my bp again and told me the doctor will be in soon. When the doctor came in he didn\u2019t speak nor  introduce himself. Talking in an aggressive tone, He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to let the chair back. Now open your mouth.\u201d After checking out the tooth that was causing pain I begun asking him a question about another tooth but he rudely stopped me in the middle of my question aggressively saying \u201cNo I\u2019m not doing that today I\u2019m just going to take that tooth out.\u201d I said, \u201cokay\u201d. The equipment was already in the room so he grabbed the needle and begun to numb me. (This is not my first time getting a tooth pulled) He stuck the needle in swiftly moving it around in my gum fast as he was pushing it further in applying lots of pressure. I know I was in pain and needles never feels good but the way he handle me was rough. As I sat there with tears going down my face and in more pain than what I came with. He didn\u2019t give it at least 1 minute to kick in. Right after he was getting ready to pull my tooth. I told him it wasn\u2019t numb because I was rubbing and pushing my tongue against my gum and tooth, I could feel it. Sounding angry He stated \u201cit should be numb!\u201d By this time the assistant came in asking me \u201care you okay?\u201d I couldn\u2019t respond. The doctor put down the tools to pull and numbed me again he shoved the needle in on the inter side of my gum applying extra pressure/force. I was holding still as possible, but the force of him pushing was pushing my head back. After that torture I stated \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this!\u201d the doctor threw the tools down on the table and started to walk out he stopped at the door because the assistant stated \u201cyou half way there let\u2019s get it out.\u201d I stated \u201c he been rude rough and aggressive since he been in here. I scared of him.He don\u2019t have any compassion nor consideration at all\u201d. In a very nasty tone the doctor then said \u201c it not my fault you need your tooth pulled. It\u2019s not my you don\u2019t take care of your teeth. You the one that needs your tooth pulled not me.\u201d  I asked him \u201c are you okay? Are you stressed or over worked? Because I felt the tension soon as you walked in the room.\u201d The doctor the stated \u201cyou already in pain so it\u2019s going to hurt. You should\u2019ve brushed your teeth\u201d. The assistant then intervened saying \u201clet\u2019s just get you out of pain it will be over soon\u201d. I agreed. The doctor tone of voice got a lot nicer afterwards.

The \"pocketing\" progressed over the two years that I went there despite my best efforts to keep my mouth clean. I didn't understand this, as I was and still am a young man, and the supposed pocketing was advancing even in previously healthy areas.\n\nI was told after 2 years of seeing them every 3 months and 2 separate full mouth scaling and root planings that my pockets had somehow worsened since my last checkup a mere 3 months ago from 5 mm in a couple spots to as far as 7 mm in several spots in all 4 quadrants and I would need full mouth gum cutting surgery(flap surgery) to the tune of over $2,000. Keep in mind that multiple dental professors were overseeing the students that told me this and confirmed their diagnosis every step of the way.\n\nIt was at this point that I finally understood that something was off about what they were telling me and went to an established periodontist. I did NOT tell this periodontist anything about my experience so far, only that I had received troubling news from another dentist and would like for my pockets to be measured. I had one 5mm spot and everywhere else was a 4 at worst. She recommended laser surgery in just that ONE quadrant with a 5mm pocket. I'm honestly not even sure I needed THAT after my experience at UAB, but I didn't want to take any chances with my teeth.\n\nIt's been over 3 years since I last went to the school of dentistry. To reiterate, they told me that I needed gum surgery and that I would likely lose all of my teeth in no time flat if I didn't do it. That my pockets would worsen and worsen at the same rate they supposedly were(4-5 mm to 7 mm in the time span of 3 months). Since then, my pockets have not gotten any worse, and in some areas have gotten much better. I have a few 4mm now that I have to clean diligently and that's it. I still have all of my teeth. I DO have tooth pain now, and I DO have gum recession now, but it's ONLY in areas that were previously healthy. For example, my two upper front teeth had no pockets or recession whatsoever at any time, even as measured by UAB. They still don't have any pockets, but after being needlessly scaled twice, the gums have receded ever so slightly and I have ugly pinholes in between my teeth. I am convinced that the only reason they ever receded in the first place was my treatment at UAB, as they have not before or since.\n\nGoing to this place was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I feel as if I paid them for the privilege of being a test subject. If I had continued trusting what they told me, I would have had completely unnecessary and irrevocable full mouth surgery. My smile would have been permanently damaged. I have a VERY hard time understanding how so many different people there could all have had SO many different measuring mistakes of the magnitude they did. Both the periodontist and dentist I go to now tell me I have no worrying pockets and never had any except in that one quadrant.\n\nI did have some other work done here as well, and as far as I know it was fine and they did a good job, but my experience RE the recommended surgery based on wrong...or fudged, not sure if that's better or worse...measurements makes me question everything they did.\n\nI hope my wording isn't too harsh, and I did experience plenty of professional and caring people there, as it's a huge clinic, but I do feel very strongly about almost going through with a life-changing surgery at my own expense only to find out from other professionals that it wasn't necessary. If I hadn't gotten a second and third opinion, I may very well have, and my teeth wouldn't have ever looked right again.\n\nI ultimately would not advise going to this clinic unless you have no other choice.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc203daed6b:0x7aa7178d56f3949f"}

Their billing department are the most incompetent people on the planet. They have a owed me a partial refund for both of my children for well over a year (due to BCBS process of having to PIF before they bill and pay for each visit)..  For one of them, they can\u2019t seem to properly communicate with our insurance company in order to get it billed properly. My other son, they supposedly sent me a refund check over a year ago that never arrived. Since October 2017, I have communicated with their offices at least a dozen times, several times in person in their office.  Every single time, they have told me that they will re-issue the check but this has never been done. Numerous times they have blamed it on not having my correct address, but the fact is they have no problem getting bills to my address. Every time I confirm my current address with them,  they supposedly input it into the system. At one point, they input an address that was virtually unrecognizable when compared to my actual address (apparently Plaza De Toros is too difficult for some people, even when spelled out!). The last time I was in there, they told me that the check was in an office across street and has been sitting there for the last year.   It would have been nice to know that I could just go over there and pick it up each and every time I have been at their building. Unfortunately, they tell me that no patients/ customers are allowed to go to that office. That makes sense, as it stands to reason that some people would more aggressive measures than I over a business\u2019 complete lack of sense and ability to properly handle another person\u2019s hard earned money. (I on the other hand, have resorted to an internet review, though I\u2019m close to taking it to a courthouse But I digress). The last time I was there, this secret office was supposedly closed. They promised me that they would have a check overnighted the next day. That was nearly 2 weeks ago.  I simply cannot fathom how so many people in a single department can be as incompetent as these people are. At one point, they sent me a bill for my son\u2019s dentistry work- the same son under which account the refund is owed. I wrote on their bill,  \u201cPerhaps when you send the refund that you have owes of me for over a year, I will pay your bill .\u201d  I placed the annoyed bill and a copy of their letter stating they owe me a refund in the return envelope and mailed it back to them. I never received so much as a phone call inquiring of why their customer service is such a disaster and how they can help.  My youngest son will be finishing up his orthodontic care there only because it has all been paid in full. Other than that, I will never utilize their services again, nor would I ever recommend them to anyone.\nThat being said, Dr. Marcello is fabulous.
