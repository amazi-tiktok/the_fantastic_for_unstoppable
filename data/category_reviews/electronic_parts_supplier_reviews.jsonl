At that time, there were only two ways to get parts: you could get higher quality parts from China, but they would take weeks to arrive, returns were difficult, and it was strange paying through western union.  Or, you can get parts quickly from Amazon or eBay, which was great through Paypal, but fail rate was high at over 40%.  If you didn't return the part within 30 days, you were screwed.  In late 2012, I was contacted by LCDCycle for parts.  It was what I was looking for; a local company that provided quick service, low fail rates, and a great return policy.  Now, my fail rate is closer to 15%, and those parts are very easy to return, I can take up to 6 months.  Sure, sometimes the fail rates can be higher, but every part is returnable, so it doesn't cost me money in the long run.  Overall, a great company that has same me thousands of dollars and hundreds of man hours in the two years I have used them.

I had originally purchased a phone from the Florence location for my daughter and it started having issues on day one.  We took it back to that location 2 times and of course they did their diagnostic tests on it, reset it twice and then sent us on our way.  Apparently i got a \"bad APPLE\" because none of this fixed the problems.  Fed up with this location, I decided to visit the Muscle Shoals location.  Let's just say that this will be my \"go to\" store going forward.  I was greeted by Nicole and she was absolutely amazing.  She presented the issues we were having to her manager \"Trinidad\" I think was his name and he agreed that the phone was bad.  They didn't have that exact color of phone in stock so she asked if I would be willing to drive to the Decatur store to get one.  I said yes so then she proceeded to call that location and told them everything.  She set everything up with a rep at that store and we swapped the phone out.

The OEM original copy we work with, offers you lifetime warranty from the manufacturer.\n\nApple stores of course know the difference since they are the only ones authorized to replace the Apple original screens and they know when you fix it somewhere else, they care about it because you didn\u2019t fix it with them. As a retail store we put our stamp behind the screen to validate the manufacturer warranty and when Apple stores see our stamp they will tell you that it is not their screen.\n\nPlease come back to our shop and give us the opportunity to test your device and validate the warranty we offer you. This will not cost you anything and we will check the reason why your Face ID is not working properly, also we would like to know the location where your device was fixed and when it was fixed.\n\nWe like to share with you that our goal is not just to repair devices, it is to make sure you are satisfied with our service by doing it right and keep our customers happy because we care about all of you. Every day we try our best to satisfy our customers as we stand behind our repairs. As I mentioned before we will take care of your device and will make sure you have the OEM original led screen and as I said it already you don\u2019t have to worry about it, it is under warranty and we will do our best to make you satisfied.\n\nPlease email me for future questions or concerns at Tuscaloosawireless@gmail.com\n\nSincerely,\n\nStore manager, Abe."}, "gmap_id": "0x88860282ed6c3989:0xf70abf01cadf6e71"}

I cannot say enough about it. I've found some amazing juices and set ups here. 205 has a wide juice selection along with all the new and top of the line mods and tanks.

MetroPCS on its own may be okay but I strongly advise staying away from the dealers because you are at the mercy of the dealers who make up their own rules. MetroPCS  as a whole is not good because they do not keep their dealers accountable. Oh and be advised there is some kind of 7 day promise of a return but again MetroPCS dealer does not advise of this nor are they up obligated to uphold this and again MetroPCS as a company does not keep their dealers accountable to this either.  District mngr could have done SOOOOO  many things different to have kept our business beginning with elementery  communication but instead he did everything wrong costing us of a lot of time energies and emotions. This is why I certainly would not want to give them any of our money we work hard for our money and we want to be treated with respect and fairness and we were not.

I went in to upgrade my and I was super excited because it would be my first iPhone . The store associate LaQuita Miles , the other team members were calling her by her nick name Shay was very rude and disrespectful.. she had an attitude the entire time helping me. So she tells me I had to pay $70 downpayment .I let her know that I looked online and it said there wasn't a down payment needed . She got defensive and said well this is what it's saying . She then said if you wanted to jumped then it would be free. I said well you didn't tell me that . She looked right at me and said it's not her job to explain that to me because it was previously explained to me when I initially got the jump service ....I couldn't believe she was talking to me like this and the fact that she said it's not her job to explain anything to was disgusting . I then proceeded to walk out because I didn't like how she was to talking to me and was going to go to another store ...she made a gesture of rolling her neck while my back was turned to leave and my niece saw it ... she exchanged words with my niece and they began to argue ... I asked to speak to the manager  . The manager Will came out and he could get her to stop arguing with my niece another store  associate had to stand in front of her because she was moving toward my niece as if she was going to assault her ...Eventually after being asked several times to got to the back she went . I was there for 4 hours trying to transfer my info over from my galaxy phone to the iPhone . The whole time we were there the employee Shay was in the back on the clock , sitting in the back. Also I was the one who had to google how to do a hard reset on google because the manager Will had something else  that he needed to do and the store associate that he left to help us couldn\u2019t reset the phone and wipe out my info . Not once did Will apologize for the behavior of the employee Shay , he was even going along with her trying to justify her telling me it's not her job to explain things to me . There also was not an apology given for the long time we were in the store . I've been wit he T-Mobile for 9 years and I pay my bill with my hard earned money and the slap in the face I received that day at that store was disgusting ....also the whole time I was there the other girl store associate with pink hair was rolling her eyes at us I guess her and the Shay girl were friends . I still can't believe how we were treated that day ...Also the long wait was due to transferring my messages over to my iPhone which never happened important messages that I needed were lost ... With ppl recording things and putting them on social media this incident with you're store associate could have turned into a viral video . I hope this is looked into so no one else has to have the same horrible experience I had . We came in the store around noon and didn't leave until a little before 4pm", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81e9fbbf21d1:0xc130a49dea94c090"}

In the process I was also canceling a current line I had on my wifes service to be more cost efficient. When I asked if I was going to have to pay the back bill the guy working said if I canceled before a specific date I wouldn't have to. Got the new phone, got the service set up, easy breezy.\n\nWhen I called Sprint to cancel the phone I was informed that it couldn't cancel until after the next billing cycle. I informed them what the store had told me and they said since there wasn't any notes they couldn't honor what I was told.\n\nNaturally, I was irritated I was going to have to pay for something I wasn't expecting. When I called the store to have the issue resolved they attempted to call Sprint again and do the same thing I had done. No results again.\n\nNow, a month later, I am still battling this issue. The store manager, Roderick, claimed to have lost my information. He knew the situation and claimed he thought I was talking about another line (not the one we had discussed multiple times). He tried to make me feel like the bad guy by saying he was working on the issue during his vacation. He asked for my social security number and read it back to me aloud in a store with other people in the room.\n\nDo not do business with this store. They are unprofessional. They are not worth the headache. This is not a slam on Sprint as a service provider. They are a great provider.\n\nIf i could give no stars I would.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4dee192eb967:0xa961723a8c44a611"}

After walking into the store we were greeted by an older, larger man. He was initially standoffish and not very welcoming until we mentioned that we were there to buy new phones.\n\nEverything was mostly fine, until I asked about a promotion at for the new Galaxy S10. The promotion was for a new, qualifying line you\u2019d get a large portion off of the phone. Because of the situation of adding a line for my wife from a different carrier, I wanted to see if we could count that for the S10 and then get her iPhone XS discount with her trade in. He insisted there was no way he could do that because I was an existing customer. I was there to release my number from my parents account and start a new plan, add my wife, and get new phones. Yet according to the sales rep, it wouldn\u2019t count and the full phone price would need to be paid because my number was already with T-Mobile. He said I could get a new phone number for myself and that would allow me to do it. I was surprised at this and since switching my phone number would be an extreme inconvenience, I asked him if I left T-Mobile for another carrier, would I qualify for the discount then. He replied that I could leave but I would get the discount until after I had left for 90 days and he \u201ccouldn\u2019t guarantee the deal would still be here\u201d when I come back.\nMy jaw was on the floor with this one. He then left to take a call and brought a younger representative over. The new rep told us about the same thing and was apologetic and started discussing other options, which started bringing us back out of our awful experience.\n\nDuring this back and forth, I received a call from a \u201cT-Mobile Expert\u201d named Michelle and she lived up to the title of Expert. She was just calling to release my number from my parents plan but ended up handling the situation and getting me the deal I was asking about without any issues.\n\nWhile I was talking to her on the phone, the gentleman I spoke to first was telling my wife at the kiosk that there was no way that the rep on the phone could get me the deal I wanted and made her feel very uncomfortable. He then came up behind me to try and get my attention to tell me the same thing and I had to plug my ear to hear the lady on the phone as he was right behind me saying, \u201cHey. It won\u2019t stick after she does it. Hey. You won\u2019t get that phone for that price.\u201d\n\nI eventually I had enough of this, turned around to get my wife, and we walked out of the store to sit in our car in the parking lot while we spoke on the phone. While we were on the phone in our car, the same man came out to the parking lot with a tablet and proceeded to wave at my wife on her side of the car to get her attention, she opened the door and he stated, \u201dI can show you right here that she cannot get you that deal.\u201d I tuned over to him, thanked him for letting us know, and closed the door for her. We left after that and the rep on the phone was able to do everything else for us from there, ending our encounter with the store.\n\nI was absolutely stunned by by this experience as I have never a bad encounter with T-Mobile prior to this. My family has been with T-Mobile for 12 years and switched from AT&T because of the price difference and great customer service by comparison. I can confidently say that if that T-Mobile Expert hadn\u2019t called me she did, I would have changed carriers that day and most likely for good. My advice? Drive a few miles down the road to a different T-Mobile store and you\u2019ll most likely not have the reps chasing you to your car to prove to you that you\u2019re wrong.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a3ee78e535:0x5cebcc8e5c29f674"}

Now they tell me I am going to have to buy a new SIM card because the one I have is faulty. Whatever happened to customer service? If this doesn't get resolved today, I will make sure that every new customer there will take their business elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888861361581eb29:0xd60cfcd5e9aeba60"}

My friend went there 2 weeks prior to do the same new phone and all. She got her new phone free, case and screen protector free, walked out costing her around $75. She was treated well didn't  take her very long at all. Her AT&T phone she had stayed active for about a week before it shutdown. But when I am there I'm there for about 2-3 hours. I got a new phone free but was charged for my case and screen protector. The man that was working Matte says on receipt acted like he didn't even want to give me a receipt said printer wasn't working. I said can you at least give me a hand written one and sign it. A lady that was waiting her turn said take a picture of computer screen. I replied that will work as long as I have something to show the money I spent. He finally printed  receipt  but  acted  like  he  didn't  want  to. I ended up and spent right close to $140. I told Matte about my friend and how much she paid 2 weeks earlier. He acted like he didn't even hear a word I had said. I also told him about when I had done a search for Metro Pcs that I had seen offering for 2 phones 32gb and unlimited  service for 1 month for $75 and told him that's what I wanted. Go figure and look at amount I paid. He told me I had to wait about a week and come back in there for my new # and pay an additional $10 to get that done. He also told me my AT&T phone would no longer work. My friends phone did. Why didn't mine work that way? By the time he got my phone and stuff fixed up after being there so long my feet hurting from standing so long and needing to get home to my grandkids. I told him I would have to just come back another day to finish up I had to get home. He told me I would have to pay same amount again for other phone. Why is that I asked for 2 phones 2 new lines for unlimited talk, text and data. It was supposed to be $75 paid one time per month period. I have tried to call store several  times no answer, I have left messages asking for manager to call me left my # , No call back as of yet. Also having problems with service it says I have 2 bars on phone and I see the 4g on phone but can't make calls. My friend  is having that same issue. I have never felt with anything like this in my life. Oh and also the guy Matte that was working also kept my phone case I had on old phone. I never realized it until next day.

AVOID !!!!!!\nThe folks working there are quite nice, but they are not trained properly and will provide misleading information that will cost your lots of money.\n\nI switched over from Verizon on the \"get out of the red\" program, they assured me that T-Mobile would cover what I owned on my phones with Verizon up to $650 per line.  I also took a BOGO (buy one get one free) offer on the S8 .   I later found out that they were supposed to have filled out some information at the store, which was NEVER done.  I did that myself,  but as it turns out the Get out of the Red and Samsung BOGO are not eligible together.    I called Tmobile support and they told me the store should honor it and for me to go to the store, I went to the store, ALL of them admitted for misguiding me and gave me some directions on what to do next,  I tried it and it didn't work.\nI went back to the store and spoke with Jamaica, she also admitted that they mislead me,  she called the store \"owner\" who basically told her that I'm out of luck and there is nothing he can do,  I asked to speak with him, and she said he was \"busy\" but would give me a call. He NEVER called me  back.\n\nSo long story short,  STAY AWAY from this location, they don't deserve anybody's business if they can't take care of their customers.

Called customer service they said there was no indication of a rebate. when we got home both of the T-Mobile phones said no service. when we went back the next day the guy behind the counter asked for our area code to check the service in our area, which the first person didn't ask for and it showed low to moderate coverage.

I went in to get an upgrade, Jennifer the sales rep tells me that because of a labor day promotion if i buy a phone its going to come with a case and a screen protector. So Im like cool, I wasn't really trying to get a case or a screen protector but if its included might as well right. She hooks my phone up and the price comes out to like 203.00 which honestly isn't a big deal but im confused as to how a 129.00 phone has 70 dollars worth of taxes, activation fees, and what not considering its not a new line. So Im like ill just go somewhere else cause honestly I could probably get a way better phone with a way better company else where. So she gets my price down to 164.14 which sounds more realistic. Checks me out and hands me the phone. No case no screen protector. So im like wheres the case and screen protector. She then begins to tell me the truth. That in fact the extra 35.00 is for the case and screen protector which wouldnt have ever been an issue had she just told me the cost up front instead of misleading me to believe it would be included with the price of the phone. These scandalous sales tactics are junk. Worse than buying a used car from a lot when the salesman knows the car is a lemon. Just be up front and honest. Dont try and hustle your customers. The entire time im standing there believing theres 70 dollars worth of activation fees and taxes and she never once told me she was charging me for the case and screen protector. Then the manager Allyson comes in to play and says well they are buy one get one free. So your telling me a screen protector cost 35.00? Or a phone case cost 35.00? It kinda sounds petty but my frustration comes from the fact that this sales rep is a liar and a fraud. So be sure to ask questions if you go there of the price doesn't sound legit because chances are Jennifer has mislead you to purchase something you probably didn't want.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0fcc71c1d3a3:0x5aaea6355822e927"}
