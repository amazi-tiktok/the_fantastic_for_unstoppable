Along with my husband, brother, sister in law and their son.\nWe check in about 1 am.\nWe are not from the area we had to come in on an emergency trip. My mother had a major heart attached. ( She was there helping her mother after her mother had heart surgery 2 weeks ago.)\nSo by the time we traveled as we did and spent all of the time at the hospital with my mother we wanted to sleep.\nWe arrived at your location checked in and went to the room. When I first walked in I notice that the ashtray was filled with cigarette butts, walked to the bathroom and seen that there was urine on the floor by the commode, then I got to looking and notice that the shower was very nasty the ceiling looked as it was fixing to fall, the shower rod was barley hanging on, and a piece of duct tape just stuck to the wall. Also notice that there was hair on the towel. Very unhappy at this point I thought let me look at the bed, the first bed was dirty, it had hair and spots all over the sheets the 2nd bed it had food on the sheets and brown spots.\nAt this point I had enough was so upset. I had dropped my keys behind the chest and had to move it and surprise again a powder substance with a straw.\nI am NO longer upset I am MAD.\nI went down to the lobby and told the desk clerk what I was dealing with. She let me know she did not have any more rooms I ask for more sheets and towels, just so that I could lay down for a few hours to be back at hospital with my mom. She said hold on walked around the corner and walked back said she did not have any and there was \"NOTHING SHE COULD DO FOR ME\". Really!!!!!!!\nSo because we had all of our items unpacked already I decided that I would just run to the nearest Walmart purchase sheets and blankets. Just so that we can get some sleep.\nWe did not even take showers due to not having clean towels.\nSo I was putting the sheets and things on the bed and SURPRISE AGAIN the matters had a very big whole in it and then I was beside my self.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a54106e190e0b:0x152474591dc23d97"}
