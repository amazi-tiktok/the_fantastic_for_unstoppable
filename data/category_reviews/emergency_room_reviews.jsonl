I had a Myelogram done at Image South in Birmingham they did an amazing job with very little discomfort of course they gave the usual possible side effects, one being a headache. I woke up the following day , Saturday, with a mild headache I took a Tylenol and thought nothing else of it. I woke up Sunday morning vomiting very dizzy and the headache was worse. My wife drove me to St. Vincent's St.Clair emergency room and she signed me in and we waited in the waiting room.  We didn't have to wait long until the triage nurse called my name and took me to check my vitals, and the is where competency ended. In all fairness the nurse that came into the room to take care of me was kind and polite. After waiting in the room a PA came in and asked the same questions that had already been asked and decided since I wasn't running a fever I didn't have meningitis and that I needed a CT scan. While waiting for the CT Tech to come the nurse came back in and gave me a shot of phenergan and Imitrex. I have absolutely  no problem at all trying the simplest medications first and I prayed it would work but it didn't. A while later and actual MD came into the room and said, \"your CT is clear were going to let you go.\" I tried to tell him that my head still felt as if it was going to explode and he said call the DR that did your myleogram. I reminded him that it was Sunday and that I wasn't going anywhere until he did something. He left the room and never came back. In just a short while another nurse came in with a paper cup and some ice water. They gave me a norco and a prescription for ibuprofen. I would guess I sae the actual MD for about 15 seconds and the nurse that brought me the medication had a major attitude problem. I told the admitting nurse that I had taken tylenol ibuprofen and asprin already. We left the ER and I went home in exactly the same shape as I went to the hospital.  IF you can at all avoid this ER.

Also, he told me and wrote on discharge papers one thing, and I spoke to my specialists on call the next day to find out he falsified documents. So, if I had found a ride to Birmingham AGAIN the next morning it would have been another waste of a trip over an hour drive. I suggest if he says his name is Dr. Gilford just get out of there and go somewhere else. The charge nurse said \"You are not bleeding out or have COVID, so it isn't an emergency\". I questioned him on this statement and he accused me of putting words in his mouth. At this point I was already beyond mad, because nobody could be truthful. So, if it is Dr. Gilford leave. Unless he sees you half dead then he may help you, but even then I don't know if I would trust.\n\nLooks like Dr. Gilford can't take truthful reviews of him and has to go about destroying patients lives with other providers.

And continues to stick needles in my arms. They did no blood work, just a cat scan, didn't see any Kidney stones which UAB in Gardendale seen in urinalysis and was treated and I was well in just 3 days. This hospital is degrading and disrespectful. They have no concerns for the emotional or physical state of the patient, because fro the time I told them I relapsed on meth, I was treated like a street junkie. When in fact I used it twice in 2 years. I was just being honest on a question. So please do yourself a favor and drive the extra distance to UAB in Gardendale.

The local urgent care suggested we visit the St. Vincent East ER for a CT scan/ultrasound to check his appendix.  As we were being discharged from urgent care, I looked up the reviews for St. Vincent and became nervous about visiting a hospital with such low ratings.\n\nOnce we arrived (on a Saturday evening), we were greeted by a friendly Registrar who checked him in and within 10 minutes we were called back to a room.  Within 2.5 hours, they had drawn blood, received the results, ordered a CT scan with contrast, diagnosed my husband with appendicitis, started him on antibiotics and began the process for him to be admitted with an appendectomy scheduled for first thing Sunday morning.\n\nThe nurses in the ER were very kind and attentive!  Always asking if we needed anything and checking in frequently with updates.\n\nOnce my husband was admitted to the 6th floor, we met Kim who assisted the nurse.  I cannot praise her enough for the wonderful care my husband (and myself) received from her!!  You can tell immediately that she has a pure passion for what she does, and the people put under her care!!  She knew I was going to stay the night and without asking, she requested a cot and provided us with extra pillows and even brought me a gown and comfy socks so that I didn\u2019t have to sleep in my day clothes.  She was so courteous during vital checks by keeping the lights off and working quickly to try not to disturb my husband while he was sleeping.\n\nDr. Nguyen was the surgeon who came and spoke with me before the surgery. preparing me for what to expect post-surgery.  They kept him for several hours after the surgery to ensure everything was working properly as the anesthesia wore off.\n\nWhen it was time to be discharged, my husband\u2019s pain levels were creeping up and he asked for some pain medication before driving 3 hours back home.  He was told that he would have to stay another hour for observation if he took the pain meds.  At that point, he just wanted to get home and in his own bed, so he declined the meds.  The nurse was kind enough to call the doctor to get approval for one of the pain pills he was prescribed to help him get home in the most comfort possible.\n\nOverall, I could not have asked for better care for my husband and would have no hesitations recommending this hospital.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890e7347a471ad:0x2850926678005a46"}

I had this same injury almost 20 years ago and was fairly confident that this was the same injury.  When I had this injury previously, I went to St. Vincent's Occupational Health Clinic which was on U.S. 280 at that time and the physician told me that it was CRITICAL that I breathe fully with sufficient expansion of my lungs (which would cause some expansion of my rib cage and the accompanying pain) to prevent the risk of developing pneumonia.  At that time, I was about 30 and in good health and I was prescribed Hydrocodone APAP 10 (mg?) and that worked well.  I had very little pain when breathing or sleeping and recovered within a couple of weeks.\n\nI'm now about 50, about 60 lbs heavier than I was then, and have been unemployed for a while but I'm attending graduate school to attain a Masters degree to teach science at the high school level.  When I visited the ER on the 9th not long after the fall, I received the same diagnosis of bruised ribs, the same warning that I must breathe fully to prevent pneumonia, but then was prescribed 500 mg Naproxen (same thing as Aleve) and a muscle relaxer.  The medicine was almost useless as it was only moderately effective for only about half the period that it was indicated.  I was still not breathing properly and had intense pain for more than 50% of the time.  The pain affected my breathing, my sleep, and my ability to concentrate on my studies.\n\nI called my primary physician (as ER instructions indicated), Dr. Jack Zaremba, after a couple of days and told his nurse that the medication wasn't effective.  They stated that I would have to come in for a visit before they could DECIDE if I needed something stronger.  I had just paid probably $100 on a copay for the ER along with the cost of the useless medication and now they wanted to suck some more money out of me before they could DECIDE if I my excruciating pain was worthy of some effective medication.  I refused.  The ER had already diagnosed me and erred in prescribing medication, so why should I have to pay more money to get an effective prescription?\n\nI'm sure that the opioid \"epidemic\" is affecting the judgement of physicians so that they are hesitant to prescribe certain pain medication, but due to their monopoly on prescribing certain types of medication, they have a duty to make sure that they prescribe sufficient medication to their patients.  The only reason I went to the ER is because I remembered that stern warning by that physician years ago about the risk of pneumonia and I expected that they would prescribe something that would actually help suppress the pain so that I could comply with their instructions about breathing.  By merely calling my physician and requesting more effective medication, they've probably added me to some DEA list of pill poppers.\n\nAfter three weeks, I'm noticing just a slight change in the level of pain which I experience.  I don't think that I'm breathing fully yet, but I don't seem to have contracted pneumonia yet.  I'm just using over the counter pain meds which are just as useless as the prescription meds were, but I see no reason to return to a physician and help them with their country club dues if they aren't going to do their job to relieve my suffering.  The next time I go to the ER at St. Vincent's East will be involuntary and via an ambulance.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890e7347a471ad:0x2850926678005a46"}

And it\u2019s a big one.\n\nOn Monday (May 20,, 2019), my brother had an outbreak of Cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection that he has had since college. When he has a Cellulitis outbreak, he has to get medical attention immediately because it is a life-threatening infection that can spread into your lymph nodes and bloodstream quickly. Every single time he has had an issue, we have rushed him to the ER. Nearly every time he has been admitted for anywhere between 2 and 10 days. It is a serious condition.\n\nWill is a truck driver. He was out to pick up a load when he came down with this infection and was so sick that he had to have a stranger take him to the ER at Andalusia Health. Typically, the ER nurses recognize the severity and get to him quickly. Not Andalusia Health. M the waiting room quickly, it was three hours before any medication was administered. Since he was on the road \u2013 and has insurance \u2013 he requested that they admit him for the night so he could regain his strength and get enough medicine in his system to get back home so he could see his doctor. Remember, he had to drive an 18-wheeler all the way back home. The ER staff at Andalusia Health knew this. They refused to admit him, telling him he \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the criteria.\u201d Please, can someone explain what criteria one must fit to be admitted into this hospital? Is it the Harvard of hospitals? He was extremely ill and had insurance. This should have been handled immediately.\n\nWhile he arrived at the ER midday, since he didn\u2019t get to see anyone until late, my mom called the ER to explain his medical history since they would not be able to contact Will\u2019s regular doctor. The nurse she was talking to hung up on her mid-story. And, as Will was getting his bearings and getting dressed to go back to his truck to sleep for the night, he wasn\u2019t fast enough for one of the nurses who told him \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cI know you aren\u2019t feeling well, but you have to go. We need the bed.\u201d Is Andalusia Health a Level 1 trauma center? The ER in a town of 8,787 (as of 2017) is that busy? The hospital has 88 rooms. Was 10% of the town so sick they needed to be in the hospital? I\u2019m asking. No, seriously, I am asking. Someone please tell me.\n\nAndalusia may or may not have Uber drivers, but my brother couldn\u2019t find one. Nor a cab company. He had to call central dispatch and have a police officer take him back to his truck, where he slept overnight, with Cellulitis raging in his body. Without any medical attention. Because Andalusia Health failed. Big time. I don\u2019t know who was on duty other than Sara Purvis, the certified nurse practitioner who saw him. But, I know that Kim Carol is the ER manager. I know that Amy Herrington is the director. I know that every time I have gone to their website, they boast the wait time being 30 minutes or less. I know that they claim to have \u201cexperienced\u201d ER physicians and staff. I know that they failed to live up to that promise. I know that I expect a call from Kohen Johns Brannon today. I know that someone needs to clarify what happened and why it happened.

What was once a clean, hospitable place now reminds us of the setting for a post-apocalyptic video game. The floors in the entrance and waiting room look more like the floors in an old garage. The receptionists (this visit) were very unprofessional, one even walked through the waiting room of patients without a mask. To add insult to filth, the floor in the room they put my step-father in was covered in old needle caps, the \"clean\" gowns/ sheets hanging from the cupboard were touching the dirty floor and there was even a skittle on the floor near more needle caps. The fact that we have been here for roughly 4 hours isn't the issue (yes, I'm writing it from the room at 0125 in the morning). The issue is that I'm worried that the Waffle House we went to while waiting has been sanitized more recently than this place.\nUpdate (0223 am): Still here, still looks like a cross between a construction zone and a crime scene but finally had an encounter with one nice receptionist.\nHowever, the reason for this edit was something my husband and I saw while waking out of the Emergency Room.\nA nurse was wheeling a very old person, whom was lying in the fetal position, from one room down the hall, filled with carts and random things, to their original room. During this time she banged the stretcher into many of the carts and walls. While hitting one cart, something that resembles an air pump regulator, fell from the shelf onto the old person. The nurse casually pushed it back onto the shelf and continued on without even checking on the person, continuing to bang them into the same shelf again. This speaks volumes for the disarray and clutter but broke my heart to see.\n\n19 July Update:\nI was contacted via email requesting a verbal conversation the day after my first post. I spoke to a representative for the hospital/ nurses/ E.R. The woman I spoke with seemed genuinely concerned with the issues I brought up. She assured me that they have the same expectations that we do regarding emergency room visits, no matter how many people were admitted.\nI can't yet change my review or rating, but I hope to have some proof in the future regarding the things she and I spoke of. That way I can continue to, honestly and with a clean conscience, recommend Flowers to others.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK4VAucBNZ4s59ZWl6MKnMIhkkvNV8m4E8l21_=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1625840840116, "text": "We are sorry to learn that your family did not have a positive experience at our hospital, but we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

What happened to critical thinking and ruling out things before jumping to conclusions? Why didn't you take a urine sample or blood? What if he had been exposed to something while at school that I don't know about? Truly disappointed by this visit. My son is experiencing something which only started about 6 months ago. Another thing, my son urinates a lot and seems to have incontinence. He has wet the bed and soiled himself on a regular basis since he turned 8 years old. He never had this problem before. I mentioned this to the ER staff but nothing else was done. When he fell asleep he did wet the bed in the ER. He has had to wear Under Jammies at night now for about 5 or 6 months.

Every time I go to brookwood hospital they are always so nice to me and try to get me out of pain as soon as they can, I do go alot for my kidneys but I think I finally have them under control.  Anyway so I went in and the first was normal as always.  After they triage me they took me back to my room and usually I would get changed and they would be a nurse coming in and starting a saline drip but not this time. Nurse comes in and realizes they have the wrong charts and go to try to find me so I thought I would get the iv after that.  Nope still no iv.  So dr comes in and he asks what's going on and I tell him and hes like so it's your kidneys, thinking to myself it's not even in the correct spot for my kidneys but anyway.\nI tell him and show him again and he just says ok I'll get you and ultra sound, I asked for something for the pain because I am in some serious pain at this point. He says I have to wait until the ultrasound which I understood because i never had one done and maybe it could alter the scan. Anyway after the scan the dr comes in and tells me i have an ovarian cyst so big it has taken over my ovary and it hurts so bad becasue the ovary has blood flow.  He is still acting as if he really doesnt care, but at that point I'm like yeah so maybe he understands the pain I am in and will give me something for the pain, but he doesnt he tells the nurse too. Well nurse comes in and ask if I have a ride home and tell him I do and then he tells me I can not have anything until.my ride gets there....\nNever in my time of going to the er hsve I been told I can not have anything for the pain until someone comes and sits in there with me. This is at 4pm sam doesnt get there until 5pm the nurse doesnt come back until 545pm. So almost 2 hours later I get something that is the equivalent to advil so of course I am still in so much pain and full of anger. I was not told what to do next or what he can do to help me. He told me to go to my ob, which I can not get into for 3 weeks and he knew that because I told him that at the beginning. So brookwood a hospital I have always defending has treated me so terribly and I have no answers and I still am in so much pain and maybe its because it was two men, but then I realize I dont live in a word like that. They just didnt understand the pain I was in because they dont hsve ovaries.\nSo still no questions answered and I had no miss work today and get to go back tomorrow still in a ton of pain.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919a1fc3c46f7:0xcfb0547ab5901b57"}

This will be long because the whole story shows how incompetent this physician is. My grandmother was in the hospital for almost a week following a colonoscopy from Cullman regional. Her spleen was bumped during the procedure and it caused her to have internal bleeding. After discharge on sunday she was short of breath on a high concentration of oxygen. No matter how much the oxygen was increased she still had extremely low levels. She was hooked to a monitor that measured pulse, oxygen saturation and blood pressure. All these things were all over the place,but Dr. Tighe told me \"we dont look at the machines, we look at the patient because the machines are always wrong. She told him her heart was feeling strange and she was struggling bad to breathe, he told us that her oxygen was low because she has COPD and this could be her new normal. I am her primary caretaker and I monitor her closely and I told him this wasn't her normal and begged him to do more tests, or to listen to her at least. But he was satisfied after he ran a urine test and a series of bloodwork. He sent her home. We were home maybe 4 hours before I had to call 911 because she could not breathe we couldn't not get her oxygen over 77, and her blood pressure had skyrocketed. The ambulance took her back to Cullman Regional, she saw another doctor there. He said she was very sick and he didn't know why Dr. Tighe had discharged her. Her lungs were full of blood clots and her heart was struggling to work. She was airlifted to Huntsville. She had clots in several places and her spleen was in terrible shape, it had to be removed. Doctors in Huntsville were afraid to attempt the surgery to remove the clots because they said it would for sure kill her. One of them called a friend of his, an angel of a surgeon who was able to remove the clots and install a vena cava filter. She is still with us today. She is very sick and weak and will heal slowly. She was put on life support because of the damage that was done to her heart and lungs because Dr. Tighe sent her home, without running tests or listening to her lungs or heart when she is having trouble with both. This is patient abuse. I just wanted to warn others, if you have to go to the emergency room at Cullman Regional and Dr. Tighe is working, demand to be transferred.

Let me stress to you the shock at walking into this place. When you arrive you hand over your bags to security to be searched and walk through a medical detector. Upon walking in i appalled. The place was disgusting. The floors and chairs were smeared in god knows what and their wasn't a hand sanitizer station visible in the place.  Upon intake my child was given a large dose of Tylenol (even though i had just given him some 2 hours before) the dose was 3.75 ml even though our sheet from pediatrician says weight gets 2.5ml. and he was given a dose of Benadryl and we were sent back to waiting room. After an hour or so we were taken to a room where the billing representative came immediately to collect my 100 copay and then an hour later we saw a resident who snottily corrected me when i called him a nurse. He asked some questions looked him over and left. I didn't see anyone again for hours. I was by myself, my child is an infant and i needed to use the bathroom. the only one was in the hall. The bed had no rails to leave my baby in, there was no nurse visible or that answered the call button to assist and the bathroom had no table to lay him on so i could use the bathroom. After a few hours the doctor comes in with a nurse and informs me that my child is allergic to tape (where they taped his eyes down for surgery that morning) and he has sensitive skin. And that they were going to give him a dose of Benadryl to help the swelling. I said NO you just gave him Benadryl on intake and a very large dose of Tylenol. They were like oh we did? Sorry.. I pointed out that the Benadryl did not help and his eye is looking progressively worse and that if he was allergic to tape wouldn't both eyes be like this?  They informed me they weren't going to do anything or run any tests and to follow-up with regular doctor tomorrow. They would however do a flu test to appease me. I know he doesn't have the flu and after 30 minutes i paged the nurse to ask if we can go home and have the flu results called to doctor the next morning? They said they will tell the nurse and send her in to talk to us. Never showed up. Flash forward another hour and 45 minutes. Flu negative and we can finally go home. Vitals and temp never checked since intake and no bloodwork drawn. Nothing. The next morning my child breaks out in the roseola rash. Thanks for nothing Children's. I'm glad my child wasn't having post-surgery infection. If my baby needs to go back to ER.

Kameron told her  he had Mash Potatoes, Pork Chop, & Corn( Let me add it was the smallest portion of food ever) but anyway Dr. Anna White then goes in to say this is a Non-Emergency Visit because if he tolerated a Meal it's not an Emergency! My response: it's an Emergency  to me because my Son never complains unless he is really sick & if he tells me he needs to go to the Dr. I'm going to bring him. Dr. Anna White then goes on to tell me that they are just counseling patients on Non-Emergency visits, I then cut her off in mid sentence & told her you don't have to help him we will leave because I felt she has had a long day & is now taking it out on us because she feels it's not an Emergency.

She said she felt like something was falling out in her vaginal area. When we arrived the staff at Huntsville Hospital ER desk and Triage were so rude to her and acted as if they didn't believe her. She was crying hysterically and they asked her if she was on drugs because of her behavior. She was in serious massive pain.\nThey treated her like as if she was a drug seeker. And I understand that they deal with a lot of drug seekers but my roommate doesn't even like nor can take opiates for pain so she would have refused them if even offered...so it was rediculous to treat her this way. And it wasn't just her...the staff was rude and hateful towards all the patients in the ER. Finally after waiting for several hours we left without her seeing a doctor or ever getting to a room. Noone checked on her, we were never given any compassion or updates.\n\nThis hospital needs some training for the employees in being nice towards customers.\n\nSecond review:\nReview for Huntsville Hospital Emergency Dept.\nMar 31, 2016\nDo not use Huntsville Hospital's ER even if you are on death's doorstep. Last night I was rushed by my family to the hospital ER after falling into a sink corner and splitting my skull open. I had lost a couple quarts of blood and my hair, face, shirt and hands were soaked with constant bleeding from my head that would not stop. I was left in the waiting room for nine hours sitting amongst vomiting flu patients in this condition without being offered a towel or bandage. The only nurse that even noticed me got angry with me for bleeding on the floor. My family members repeatedly asked for a house nurse or supervisor and the nurses made fun of me and never got any supervisor or head nurse of any kind. I was treated with disrespect, unkindness and absolutely no compassion. The employees seemed so numb to patients needs that they did the very minimum their jobs required and spent most of their time belittling and making fun of patients who were truly hurt or sick. Two nurses who seemed to be the ones in charge more than anyone else were making fun of patients and literally making bets with the security guards about how many times certain patients would throw up or moan. I have never seen such a lack of empathy. I finally left the ER waiting room without ever receiving medical treatment or even one kind word from any employee, receptionist or nurse. I will absolutely never trust Huntsville Hospital for my medical needs and I will urge everyone I know to stay far away from this understaffed unprofessional joke of an emergency room. This place needs to be shut down if they can't get their act together. Both of my parents used to work for Huntsville Hospital, mom for many years it hasnt always been this bad. Also,I have two forms of excellent premium medical insurance. I am in such utter disbelief at how terribly I was treated. What happened to this ER to make it so unorganized and under staffed?

He prescribed antibiotics, which kicked what turned out to be an intestinal infection right out. The nurses at the ER were kind and made me feel better, but as a whole, the experience sucked and I cannot recommend this place at all unless you're actively bleeding out. If you can help it, make the drive to Birmingham (or anywhere else for that matter).", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83ba2999eed:0x4a1642c25c8ec883"}

I think I have a concussion. My vision is blurry, I'm passing out, my ears are ringing, my head is pounding, I'm nauseous, and I'm super dazed. They call me back, say they'll give me a CT scan and an EKG. They give me the CT scan, then put me back in the waiting room. I asked the nurse if this was where I'm supposed to be and she says it is. Next thing I know, a siren is going off and I get super dizzy and my head starts pounding and I feel like passing out. I've told every nurse I've seen that I feel super dizzy, and they don't seem to care. I really need to lay down and I feel like I'm on the verge of passing out. I feel like I'm not getting proper care and I hope this concussion isn't super bad, because if it is, I'm confident that I'll never find out. Cannot believe I have to pay for this \"care.\" I'm struggling to type this out, but know this: DO NOT COME HERE. GO TO NORTHPORT REGIONAL EMERGENCY OR DRIVE TO UAB IF YOU CAN.\n\nUpdate: I got back, and about 10 minutes later a doctor said they only need to do the EKG if I \"passed out\" and used quotation hand gestures when saying my symptoms. I told him I wanted it if it was necessary, and that I did pass out. Totally acted like he did not care, and acted like he didn't believe my symptoms. Had a really bad attitude, so if something is wrong with me, I'll never know because he refused to give me the EKG. NEVER COME HERE. GO SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.\n\nUpdate: It is the morning after. I'm still super dizzy and feel like passing out and my heart is racing.

My daughter was brought in by ambulance over 6 hours ago with severe chest pain. She was unable to stand up because she was in so much pain. Unfortunately DCH was the closest hospital so coming here was out of her control. They sat her in the waiting room and one of the nurses yelled at her for whining and told her to knock it off.  The IV the paramedics gave her came out and again, this same nurse yelled at my daughter and told her it was her fault. They did do an EKG after 2.5 hours of being there, and did bloodwork, x-rays and a urine test but still no results. 6 hours later and they hadn\u2019t even take her vitals!  I called 3 different times and spoke with 3 different people and was given different stories each time. This is a hospital near a university campus.
