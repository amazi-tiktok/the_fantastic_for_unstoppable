The workers leave dogs in pee and poop filled kennels for hours before they are cleaned.\nThe dogs don't go outside from 4pm to 7am the next day.\nThey have had 2 cases of kennel cough since spring break, and have still been using the same sponge to clean all of the dog bowls.\nIf your dog is having a health issue while boarding, the workers will not tell you about it if they don't think it's serious. There are dogs who get incredibly sick either from stress or other health problems that result in blood in the vomit and/or stool. The only thing they do is take the dogs food and water away and don't let them outside.\nThe dogs water bowls are only checked at 7am and then again at 4pm. So your dog may be going without water for any number of hours between those times and the workers will ignore it. The bowls are only cleaned once per day, so if your dog is boarding for several days, there's a very good chance that they'll have the same bowl of water over the course of their stay. They have a major rat problem there, so often times there is rat feces in the water bowls.\nThe dogs are left alone all night with the rats, which your dogs could be eating over night, making them very sick and possibly catching diseases.\nThe workers do not have first aid training, so if your dog chokes on the mulch that is outside in the play area, then they are told to \"look up an instructional video\" to help the choking dog.\nThey don't pay attention to what the dogs are doing because they're too busy on their phones to care. So if your dog poops mulch (very bad for his digestive system) then it's because they were eating it from the play area. There are also several dogs who eat poop, so if your dog has that habit, it's probably only getting worse because they think they're allowed to do it while staying there.\nWhen the dogs are playing outside, they are sometimes not given water for several hours due to certain dogs not liking the water hose.\nI have witnessed a coworker giving the wrong dog her medicine. Once that realization was made, still nothing was done about it.\nIf your dog is not good with other dogs, they are set as \"individuals\" where they play by themselves. These dogs are only getting 10 minutes outside to play, and then they get 10 minutes inside to play. They are supposed to have another 10 minutes to play but are usually skipped because the workers want to go home early. So if your dog is boarding over the weekend and they're not good with other dogs, then they're only getting about 20 minutes of outside time every day while the other dogs get over 2 hours.\nThe weekend hours are different, so all of the play groups are shortened and the dogs are left alone for a lot longer than they normally would be.\nTheir medicine is put in pill pockets in their food. If the dog doesn't voluntarily eat the pill pockets, then that dog will not be getting their medicine that day.\nThe dogs only have access to their food for a couple hours a day. So if your dog is a grazer and doesn't eat all of their food at once then they will be eating very little over the course of their stay.\nThe kennels are painted very poorly, paint is always chipping off the walls, usually because dogs are chewing it off.\nWorkers regularly spray dogs in the face with Bitter Apple spray. This spray is supposed to be used for dogs that have problems chewing their fur, and is not meant to be sprayed in the eyes or nose of the dogs, but they are regularly sprayed in the face if they are barking in their kennels.\nIf you request for your dog to be given a bath, they will usually bathe the dogs very early in the day to get it out of the way. Once they're bathed, they are not allowed back outside and their food and water bowls are taken away. So if you dropped your dog off at 8am to be picked up around 5pm, there's a good chance that your dog hasn't been outside or had food or water since about 10am.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519324162478, "text": "Hi Lori, I wanted to reply here as well since I did not hear back from you regarding this same review you left on Facebook.\nI'm truly sorry this is how you felt about working at CDT.\n\nAs one of the owners, and the person responsible for systems management in the locations I am very upset to hear these things.

They have an awesome watering fountain for the dogs and the standard dog park double gated entrance for safety. They do need to keep the poopy bags supplied better. They have nice dispensers but there were never any bags in them. We always brought our own so it wasn't a problem for us but it must have been a problem for some dog owners as there was quite a bit of pooh around! That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating. I noticed there weren't many locals using the park and 1 resident said she's lived a few blocks from it for years and just recently discovered it. Dog owner's should really try this park it's great for your pup and you might make a new friend as well!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4f65c38ed519:0x18b612489363a982"}

I love that it's an extremely dog friendly bar&park, but I felt like the rules were not clear enough at some points. The bar seemed too trusting of dogs, and their owners at some points, and too strict at other points. Most places should have rules placed in more than one location. Also, there's no indicator of dogs that are restricted, other than verbal statement.\n\nI was  also not fond of the small portions for their meals for the price I paid.
