A friend drove me from my MD visit over to this merchant  and I hobbled inside.  I knew I would need to present my insurance information cards and make a payment.\n\nThe employee desks are situated at the very back of the room beyond the product displays. \"For sale\" reclining and lift chairs are located to the left,  then there is a huge group of walkers, wheel chairs, bathing safety seats etc located in the middle section of the store. Neither employee visible got up when we entered the store.\n\nAn employee called out something to us from the desk area.\n\nMy friend encouraged me to sit in the first reclining chair but as it was a floor product I hesitated to do this and  continued towards the back of the store towards the employees.  One of the employees finally said, \"you can sit in one of those chairs\".\n\nI AM trying to make a long story short.\n\nI ended up buying a cast boot, but they informed me that they did not take my insurance so I paid out of pocket for the item.\n\nThe first boot they tried on me was way too big and they quoted me a price of $89.00 for the item.\n\nIn the end they sold me a higher valued, smaller product at close to the price they originally quoted, so I will give them credit for honoring the price they quoted. That is why 2 stars rather than 1 star. (I think the real reason I got the lower price was because my friend advocated for me regarding the price. I could not hear what was said,  because I was still sitting over against the wall in a recliner,  and my friend was over at one of the staff desks.)\n\nThe staff did not appear to know or understand their products very well and did not really explain much about the boot I bought. They were not gentle or accommodating of my injured foot which was covered in a sock, but swollen and quite painful. The boot was not put on my foot/leg correctly. The tops of the two rigid metal posts that are covered in a hard, rough, scratchy Velcro product were up above the padding of the boot.  After a bit of struggling by the employees, I really just wanted to finish the process and get out of the store. My foot hurt and nothing they were doing was helping at all.  Later, after I got home,  my husband and I looked at the picture on the cast boot box.  The picture clearly showed the boot padding extending up above the two rigid metal posts.\n\nThe posts had already sanded away the skin on both sides of my calf/shin. My husband reassembled the boot correctly and put it back on my foot after putting bandages on the two sores on my calf.\n\nThis store needs to rethink the showroom set up. The employees and their desks should be located near the door.  I realize that their product storage and office space are located at the back of the store but they ARE selling medical devices for customers who probably have some kind of limitation. The employees are the ones who should be making the trek across the store. It might also be a good idea for them to have a wheelchair available just inside the door that they could direct a customer to, if needed,  as soon as they entered.  This would be another advantage to the employees being stationed near the door.\n\nLet me be clear. No one was rude to us, but, no one seemed very concerned either. The first girl who tried to help us must have been new and was not familiar with the  boot products.\n\nThis necessitated a second, presumably more experienced staff member also assisting us. The second staff member was pretty obviously not pleased that she had to become involved and was very abrupt with the first staff member.\n\nAll in all it is not an experience I would repeat.\n\nAfter I got home and was finally comfortable with the cast boot, I looked up cast boots on Amazon and I could have gotten a comparable or even better product at half the price. And, Amazon has great customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886266179711a56d:0x909b87d6f07bead6"}

I drove 12 hrs. To get here only to find out at 1130pm. That part of my cpap mask was left at home 12hrs. Away. I went to a late night emergency clinic to find one only to find out they couldn't help. I then went to the emergency room at the closest hospital to find out theirs weren't comparable either. I almost resigned myself to stay up all night fearing to go too sleep.  See sleep Anna is nothing to play with, breathing can stop and kill you so going to sleep is dangerous.\n\nI went on line to see if any of the company's that delt with breathing equipment if they had any emergency after-hours  procedures.God is great. As I glanced through  all the options this one stuck out for the simple reason that they emphasized their care for late-night and emergency needs. My son and I called and left messages hoping that someone would call back.\n\nTheir advertisement said that after 12pm that their recording system would call back in the morning. But being it's a holiday I didn't think anyone would.  But by the grace of God around 1210 I was at the hospital emergency room when I got a call. To my surprise the caller wasn't the on call person but one of the owners themselves.\n\nSee he took the on-call because the on-call person tested positivefor Cov19 and he decided to not put anyone else on call.  He had never before  been on call. He met me at his office 15 minutes later, gave me a complete upgraded mask for  free. Saying no one should be deprived of a goods night sleep.\n\nSo to Michael Harden with ONEAL MEDICAL in Birmingham Alabama, you have given me the best Christmas gift, friendship,commitment,and above all, your word that you would answer anyone who needed help no matter when.\n\nThanks", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608916953736, "text": "Thank you Phillip!
