I spoke to the barista about what happened and she let me know that she sat you right after I had left for the evening. We close early on Sundays so that staff can go home and be with their families for Sunday dinner, and the closing baristas are not supposed to seat guests after 5:45p. The employee who waited on you didn't want you to be disappointed by turning you (or either of the other two tables that showed up right before closing) away, so she sat you without letting you know the policy. Having experienced the stressful situation that followed, she now understands why we don't seat after 5:45p on Sundays. Your review helps to reinforce why the seating policy is in place, and I really appreciate you bringing your experience to my attention.\n\nAs for the cheese plate, I'm sorry it wasn't explained more fully. I do always present it with an explanation of what is being served, but the barista who waited on you had never presented a charcuterie before and was unsure of what to do. Again, I apologize for the confusion!\n\nI'd love to bring you back in sometime when I am on shift, so that I can extend you an apology in person and make sure you have an amazing experience.

As for cost, our menu prices are set to be similar to other sit-down cafes and restaurants in the area.

The decor is nice but I expect more substance over style for these prices.\n\nPros:\n- Lovely interior decor and details (\"painted red\" roses) with a nod to the Alice in Wonderland theme\n- Cozy coffee house feel\n- Dessert items (ice creams, cakes, waffles) tasted great\n\nCons:\n- Food was extremely slow and out of proportion to the difficulty in making the food.  Took an hour for my friend to receive her banana split dessert.  Despite us asking about it we kept being told \"they're working on it.\"  It's a banana split dessert.  What exactly is there to \"work on\"?\n- Quesadillas underfilled; not much besides cheese (supposed to have steak, peppers, etc)\n- Waitress seemed extremely uncomfortable in her role; she kept making comments about our party as if we were inconveniencing her at her job.  She had a hard time separating our checks despite our party offering to walk up to the register to help her.\n- Our table was served food slower compared to tables that arrived 15-20 mins after us.\n\nHonestly I wish the food and service (both very subpar aside from desserts) matched the emphasis on decor.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb393b79e14f9:0x4b36df30e0221a91"}

I'm sorry to hear that you had a less than ideal experience. I hope you'll reach out to me and let me know what confused you about our restaurant and which meal left you hungry. We do try to keep our portion sizes to a reasonable caloric range that is both filling and healthy, but sometimes we miss the mark. My e-mail is Alice@TheWonderlandCafe.com if you'd like to reach out!\n\nTo address your other comments, yes!, you are correct that our restaurant is geared towards millennials. MIllenials are the generation born between 1980 and 1996, so those between the ages of 21 and 38. That is the generation that my husband and I belong to. There are many restaurants in town aimed at other generations, but as our generation heads towards our 40's you're likely to see many more Millennial-owned establishments springing up. As is the norm in our generation, we do aim to bring a fun, hip, and distinct vibe that you can't find elsewhere in town. If this isn't your thing, we totally understand! Not everyone is going to be feeling the vibe. ;)\n\nAs for the coffee, I will happily concede that if it's a standard cup of hot coffee that you're after, you're definitely better off going to an actual coffee shop, which we are not. I've been going to Carpe Diem and Satori for well over 15 years now, and agree that they're great! Wonderland is a brand new eclectic eatery and Bubble Cafe. We've only been open about a month and a half now! Bubble drinks are definitely a 'millennial thing' and very new to the Mobile Bay Area, but I fell in love with them when I travelled out of state for college in the early 2000's, and I'm thrilled to be able to offer this delicious treat to my home town.\n\nIf the Bubble Cafe part is what was confusing, I can understand that! We've done our best to break down the menu as clearly as possible, but being introduced to an entirely new-to-the-area food concept can put one a bit out of sorts, hence the idea of slipping into Wonderland. Some people find this fun, but I can understand that not everyone is about trying new things on a leap of faith. I hope that if you return, you'll ask your server for some samples and pointers. Bubble samples are always free to newcomers and are helpful if you want to learn about this unique beverage! If you're feeling less adventurous, all of our specialty drinks are pretty much calibrated for complete epicness, so they're an easy place to start- but they're likely not what you're looking for if you're just after a basic cup of joe."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb393b79e14f9:0x4b36df30e0221a91"}

There is absolutely no mold in the walls. A few days before we took over the lease of the unit, we saw that there was bubbling in the paint on the walls. My husband peeled back the paint and we found a significant amount of mildew through the wall and down into the baseboard, caused by a leak at the neighboring business. We notified the landlord immediately that we could not take over the lease if the issue was not addressed. We took many pictures to document the situation, and sent them to the landlord. The following Monday, the contractor came in, fully sealed of the effected area in tapping with a fan to dry the wall, then removed the entire bottom half of the front west wall from the floor to six feet up. This removed the mildewed area, as well as the two feet above it. The inside of the wall was removed, and affected boards and insulation replaced, with mold block being sprayed in throughout the repair. New drywall was installed, primed, and repainted. I realize that the pictures I took for the landlord to show the original damage are circulating on Facebook, but please take two minutes to think about why they exist. Do you honestly believe that my husband and I ripped a wall partially down, documented the damage, and then paid to have a secretly damaged wall rebuilt? Doesn't it make way, way more sense that we took the pictures to document an issue that needed to be fixed in order to have the matter addressed and remedied by the landlord? Seriously, why else would we have taken so many pictures documenting the damage?\n\nAs far as you saying that I'm showing up at people's houses cursing and screaming, this is also completely falseYes, we have a past employee who was let go of last October and who continues to slandering the business the internet over. Her mother, who she lives with, lives down the street from me. Since this young woman cannot be reasoned with, and has continued to slander me, my family, my employees, and my cafe, I did in fact go over to speak with her mother, who is my neighbor, calmly and matter of factly explaining (mother to mother, neighbor to neighbor) that if her daughter does not stop posting untrue information attempting to ruin my business, I will be filing a lawsuit. I wanted to give her a chance to speak with her daughter about honestly and most definitely how not to react to being let go of by an employer.\n\nThe fact that you have written this  review, believing the absolutely bizarre things this young woman had said about me and my cafe, only further proves her guilt in what is fast approaching a lawsuit, should this harassment continue. Speaking the truth about a business is legal, spreading lies that damage a business's reputation and cause damage to the business is absolutely not.

When I first arrived the two staff members looked mortified that someone had walked into their restaurant so I waited outside. The owner later showed up with her toddler in tow.

The table that was sitting behind them were seriously confused and kept making comments about it. Her daughter even came up to my table and started trying to mess with my daughter who I had brought with me. I was super excited because this seemed like a great idea for a restaurant but it's poorly managed and poorly executed.
