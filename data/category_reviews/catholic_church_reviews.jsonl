The stuffed crab did not have any onion, celery, parsley, Italian Seasoning. The gumbo did not have any seasoning and was watery, more like gravy. It should have been put on a low heat and allowed to thicken. Everyone I knew loved it but me. I said, \"It is not like Mama's.  No seasoning, and the gumbo's too runny.\"\n\nI realize the necessity to cool it with the seasoning when selling to the public because of allergies.  One cousin said that he is allergic to black pepper. Most of the people who grew up in this parish are related.
