I continued to check on it day after day and about a week later when I googled the Jenome 3000 Ken's Sewing center changed it from \"out of stock\" to \"IN STOCK\" I immediately added it to my cart and checked out. 2 weeks pass and I called to check my order status and the lady in the phone says \"sir, this was a pre-order\" I argued and told her I would never have bought it if it was a pre-order. She says yes sir it clearly says pre-order. I checked my receipt, and no where did it specify that this was a pre-order. I googled Jenome 3000 and again it clearly says \"IN STOCK\". So I called again to speak with a manager and the secretary tells me he's busy and she could help me, I explained the story and she tells me, \"yes sir, it does say IN STOCK, but if you scroll down to the details it does say it's a pre-order, and she was right.

That's false advertising and now they put me 2 weeks behind getting another machine for my wife's business. Completely unprofessional and tricky.

They finally sent the first foot- after I purchased and used the one I bought locally.  I didn't think much about it and over a YEAR LATER, I still hadn't received the second foot that I had paid for.  I called them, AGAIN, and she  located my order and saw that the second foot had NEVER BEEN SENT. She said the 'Billing' person wasn't in, but she assured me that she would have them issue me a refund, in the form of a check.

Kind of makes sense, since Ken's needs to pay Amazon a commission.\n\nMy wife called to inquire, and the woman at Ken's who answered the phone (no phone menu, no transfer, no \"I need to ask my manager\") quickly said that she understood how we could have misunderstood the listing difference, and that she would send the extra feet free of charge. They just arrived today, 3 business days later.\n\nI'm kind of impressed that Ken's made us whole on something that after all, was our mistake.

The website says it has excellent service, but Donna and Kevin (owner?) are really unprofessional. Long story short, I received two defective machines and now they have everything back and don't want to give me my money back. The way Donna handles \"customer service\" is to hang up the phone on you and tell everyone to not answer your calls and not respond to emails. When she does decide to respond via email after writing many times, she doesn't solve the problem, she just causes more and doesn't sign off. The way Kevin \"solves problems\" is to lie and make up whatever is convenient for him. Have him email you so he cannot go back on his words.\n\nupdate: RELUCTANTLY, they sent me a third machine that I did NOT want. YES, I had to pay for shipping. The second one was broken within a month and I have email proof that I informed them at that time. I tried to save them money and have them send me a piece and change that to see it that is what was broken. Of course it was over a month by then and hard to contact them so they wanted me to pay for shipping. I had no choice b/c they wouldn't give me a refund for the broken machines they sent me. This was after months of them not refunding me my money & having possession of their machine. Donna was extremely unprofessional and childish. To expand on what I wrote above, she would hang up the phone on you and then when I try to call numerous times, she wouldn't pick up. I would then call with a different phone and then, wah-lah, she is magically answering the phone again. Who does that? Then Kevin gets the phone and has the nerve to tell me I hung up the phone. If I hung up, why would I have tried calling back several times to no avail? Kevin kept giving me the run around and wouldn't let me talk to the owner. I asked him NUMEROUS times to give me the same order when he shipped it, yet when I received it, the threads I had chosen were not included. The ugliest colors they could find were thrown into the package they sent me. I am so tired of dealing with them, I didn't even bother to contact them.\n\nBuyer beware!
