A rock hit my windshield this morning on my way to work & he just came to my job and repaired it. It looks like nothing ever happened. Before I called him, I called a big name company and the price they gave me was outrageous, not to mention that they tried to talk me into getting a new windshield when the star was not even 2 inches wide. Keith repaired it with no issues and a fraction of the price.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88861d59941642d1:0x787e1c5983da369c"}

However...the Jones Valley stop CSR's had been polite & answered questions...but wouldn't help gather my large quantity of items. I had to gather, lift, & carry them.\nFollowing Spine & Hip injections, this was strain to my back & painful. Afterwards, I struggled walking. The associate permitted me to use their plastic cart. After leaving, I was complaining to myself, as I crossed the street to my car. A lady, carrying Bath & Body bag, crossed as well. I commented about the associates at the store being lazy.\nAs that person went on. I loaded my things & was leaving the cart on the grass.  The lady in the parking area yelled & demanded I return the cart. I didn't fully understand. So, I asked again what she said. She made her demand on me about 3 times.\nI asked her if she worked there? She said yes.  I asked if she was a Manager? She said Yes!\nI tried to tell her about the laziness I was dealing with.\nShe became irritated with me. No peaceful problem solving was enacted.\nShe came hurriedly at me. I asked her to stop. I warned her, she was crossing the line.  She came anyways, within inches of me, calling me lazy, grabbed my cart without my permission, & proceeded to the store, being loud, calling me lazy repeatedly, & told me to never step foot in her store again!\nShe definitely broke the Covid rules, & came to close to me besides, causes me to feel uncomfortable.\nI requested the 911 service & filed a report.\nThe Manager, should have been more professional.  She ordered me to never come back & she don't have to worry.  I don't want to!!!\nAll I can say is remember when shopping at the Jones Valley location, to take help for you, because they are not much help.  And watch out for the Quick Tempered Manager.\nIt's 4 AM & my Spine & hip still hurt.

He seemed very sincere and wanted to earn our business, but we had already signed an agreement with a different company.\n\nWhere the individual we interacted did not show professionalism and courtesy, Huntsville Glass Company's manager did. We'll consider them for service in the future, solely based off our interaction with their manager.\n******\n\nRating - 2/5\nI'd consider giving a better review if I could actually get them to come out and provide an estimate. For 2 weeks, we've been attempting to get on their schedule. Instead, we get last minute phone calls stating that they're in the area and can stop by. If we could get maybe a 2 hour head's-up, we could accommodate Huntsville Glass' busy schedule.\n\nOur most recent interaction ended with the individual hanging up abruptly. I suppose they're busy enough they don't need to take the time to schedule estimations with customers 2 hours in advance.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b5e4c2eed59:0xb3054d6f2ff51ed8"}
