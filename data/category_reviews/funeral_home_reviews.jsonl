I believed their reputation of being professional and accommodating being that my mom was so far away from home. My mother's transport and burial service went fine. But now, 6 months later, there is still no  headstone on my mother's grave. I've called several times in the last 5 months to ask when they would set the headstone.  Each time I'm either blown off, or made a very convincing promise that it will be taken care of right away. Nothing ever gets done. My family has gone through our first Holidays without my mom, and I'm sure Sunset Memorial has no concern about the numerous calls I get from upset family members that can't find her grave site when they go to visit her. Her birthday is coming up in 2 days, undoubtedly with the same result. No headstone in her memory. The last time I called a few days ago, I spoke to Ben (again) who made it a point to mention to me that \"they'd been busy\" (for 6 months, apparently), \"it's been raining\" (for 6 months, apparently), and he reminded me that they do the headstone \"free of charge\" (which I'm sure isn't accounted for anywhere in my $13,000 payment to them, made immediately and in full 6 months ago).  I deeply regret using Sunset Memorial for my mother's arrangements. She's laying in an unmarked grave, for 6 months now, and Sunset Memorial could care less.

My problem is that one of the female employees and I do not remember her name but from what my husband says is that she is the office administrator. She is perhaps a little to friendly but only with men. My husband and myself attended a relatives funeral service on Friday January 8, 2021 and as everyone was standing around talking my husband went to ask a question for some help because we were going to purchase some spaces here. So he came back after a few minutes and said he would not be buying spaces from their until they got rid of the women at the front who told him that she would be more than happy to help him with anything he needs especially if it does not have anything to do with funeral business. He then told her he was married and just wanted to know about the plots and she said well marriage doesn't matter to me I promise I will not tell your wife anything.  I did not want to cause any big drama while at my families funeral as I was already grieving.  I really hope that the manager does something about this woman because it is very unprofessional not to mention the way that she was dressed it should never be alright to wear skirts that short unless you work somewhere less professional.

The viewing I attended was for a dear friend of mine. He was so compassionate about his dogs and loved them so much. As soon as I entered the funeral home I was greeted by a young girl that seemed to be her early 20's. She was so respectful and mature beyond her age. She walked me to the lobby and showed me where the register book was and led me into the door way to the chapel. As soon as I entered the chapel I was blown away by how much time was dedicated into displaying all of Terry's items. Pictures of his Juke room, dogs, baby pictures, sisters, cars he's owned, adventures him and Marco had been on, and it was everything that he would of loved. The slide show of pictures that were playing on the TV and also on a tv in the lobby brought back so many memories, smiles, laughs, and tears. There was a stained glass that was placed up front on display and lights were placed behind it to help make it stand out.  I was just in awe at how much time and compassion was spent on my dear friend.\nThe young funeral director that was assisting the family was there for them, as well as every one else for anything they needed. She was there for every tissue that was needed and even handed out bottles of water to the family and friends. His sisters, mother, father, and other family members were sitting on the front pew. I noticed his father dropped his mothers glasses and he did not notice it. Beth seen them as soon as they hit the ground and quickly picked them up before they were stepped on.\nThank you to Keith, Jennifer, Beth, and Steven for the funeral. People always say that as time goes on it gets easier. Walking back in the funeral home the second day seemed much harder. Keith, Steven, Jennifer, and Beth were there for me as well as the family every step of the way.

He had specified what he wanted in his trust. But I had never made funeral arrangements in the past. So I needed help quickly. I had received an emphatic suggestion from a friend who had used Johns-Rideout\u2019s service and was elated with how they handled themselves. I inquired and within minutes on a Friday evening, I found myself on the phone with Keith McKinney who became my primary point of contact. Within 5 minutes we were good friends. Yes, I know he\u2019s done this before. That\u2019s exactly what I needed.\n\nKeith wasted no time as we dug into a plan of what was requested, how we\u2019re going to accomplish it, and milestone targets in order for us to meet the needs of a memorial service in a local church on Wednesday. I gathered the rest of my family and met with Keith in his office on Saturday. He was impressively diplomatic, empathetic and productive as he juggled differing opinions into selection decisions. Before we knew it, we were ready to move forward. Most everyone had their own assignments. Keith had a predetermined obligation on Monday & Tuesday, so he introduced my family & I to his colleagues, Jennifer Coleman & Beth Galloway. From the first \u201chello\u201d, they were as pleasant and truly helpful as Keith. Over the next two days, Jennifer quarterbacked the process with efficiency & grace. Communication was virtually seamless.\n\nWhen the big day came, we all met at the church early and it was crystal clear that they had not missed ANY detail. Arrangements were flawless. What an honor to our deceased family member to have such first-class arrangements made with such competence and professionalism. Everything from visitation to memorial service to reception featuring a finely catered lunch was perfect.\n\nOnce the crowd thinned, hugs were exchanged and things were cleaned up, my wife & I agreed that, based on this experience, we definitely want to pre-arrange and pre-pay our own memorials with this specific Johns-Rudeout\u2019s team. Who wouldn\u2019t? This occasion is supposed to be somber. And at times, it was.

My Mother In Law could not even send flowers because of this, and they could give no details on when and where the funeral was being held until just 18 hours before the service.\nIf you live in the Walker County, Alabama area, I would suggest avoiding this company as being unprofessional, and completely lacking in compassion and basic human decency. As I said, I don't usually make these kinds of posts, but this company seemed to go out of its way to make a difficult time even more unpleasant.\n\nAs someone who buried her middle son in Texas in September under the auspices of a funeral home and director who could NOT have been more kind to his stunned wife and our family, I find it morally abhorrent that the home put the family through this.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888614b1415d923:0xabc4ae9212f127be"}

She was so loving and comforted anyone she could. At that time, we were both pregnant, due about a month apart. I didn't deal with the planning process in these funerals, but in January when my infant son passed away, I knew immediately which funeral home to go to for services. They went above and beyond to make sure my little boy was taken care of and gave us the opportunity to get many momentos. Even though we did not use their facilities for a visitation or funeral, we still got the same level of service that my grandmother received when she planned my uncle's and grandfather's funerals.\n\nWe were one of the first clients of Casey after she came back from maternity leave and she was so compassionate and caring checking to see if there was anything else she could help us with and making sure my husband, daughter and myself were doing as best as we could given the situation. They will always be our go to funeral home for our family in the future for the love and support we got from the entire staff at Alabama Heritage. Thank you, Casey & Paul, for all that y'all have done and continue to do. I would recommend them to anyone.

Properly caring for the deceased is one of Jeremy\u2019s innate gifts. He is thorough, devoted, and extremely knowledgeable. He will go over and beyond his duties to make sure your needs and wishes are met. In my biased opinion all should call him immediately when not knowing where to turn after losing a loved one.\n\nOur family was introduced to Jeremy the day of my father\u2019s passing in February of this year. To our disbelief, on the same day, my father-in-law passed away in his hometown a few hours from Montgomery. As one can imagine chaos was an understatement, but once Jeremy stepped in, a sense of calm and order took over. He made sure all we wanted for the funeral was honored and if any requests seemed unobtainable, Jeremy magically made it happen. If we forgot a detail, Jeremy would respectfully remind us of what was needed. The day of my father\u2019s funeral and burial Jeremy and his staff had every step beautifully orchestrated. He made saying \u201cgoodbye\u201d a tranquil experience.\n\nSix months after my father's death the unimaginable occurred. My son lost his life outside of the state of Alabama. The circumstances were beyond horrible and extremely complex. I do believe Jeremy was the second person I called after we were told the news. He said, \u201cWhere is your son and who do I call?\u201d Except for a few details, Jeremy handled the rest. He made the complexities look trivial and again orchestrated a perfect funeral and burial.\n\nIt would be unfair if I did not commend the entire staff at Leak Memory Chapel. From the one who compassionately answers the phone to those who work tirelessly behind the scenes, all at Leak are a team whose goal is to treat the deceased and family with dignity and respect.\n\nLastly, if your loved one passes while away from Montgomery, if available, use a Dignity funeral home. Leak Memory Chapel is a Dignity funeral home and I promise having sister funeral homes working together removes many layers of stress and grief from a trying situation.\n\nThank you Jeremy Wade and Leak Memory Chapel.

We say that because Rockco provides local home town service combined with the benefits of SCI Shared Resources Funeral Homes, which are located in most areas in the USA. SCI is important if the pre-plan chooses cremation. The reason for this comes into play when a person dies outside of the local area. When that happens, the family of the deceased only needs to call Russell Rasco or one of the other Rockco personnel. Russell will then contact an SCI funeral home in the area where the individual died. That funeral home will do the cremation. The urn will then be sent where the family wishes. This avoids considerable expense.\n\nIn our efforts to reduce the future burden and cost of our funeral arrangements for our children, we decided to explore some of the options regarding funeral arrangements. We didn't know Russell Rasco before we visited the Rockco funeral home on 11/26/19. Russell provided us a lot of information and answered our questions for two hours at that time. We met with Russell again on 11/29/19 for another two hours. Russell patiently gave us all the information we asked for. We only plan to make funeral arrangements once. We believe in doing it right and not overpaying. Rockco Funeral Homes prices are fair.

Our parents many years ago had purchased the complete funeral package so as to help ease our worries and hearts when this time came, and Stephen already had neatly laying out on the table the complete folder of our sweet mother's wishes that she and our father years ago itemized all the way to which color flowers with dear Alisa's wonderful help! Every single thing was so patiently explained to us by Stephen and Leonetta. Great respect was shown to us by them as we explained certain things we wanted to do for our mother's preparation in applying her makeup and fixing her hair. We were treated with compassion and professionalism as our requests were honored and arrangements were made where promises we had made to our beautiful mother were fulfilled! Our wonderful team of excellent professionals were not only with us at our Church the day of our mother's funeral, but were also with us the evening before for the visitation making sure that everything was as we wanted for our dear mother! Stephen kindly moved beautiful flower arrangements exactly where we requested and remained to make sure we were at peace! Alisa unbelievably had more beautiful, baby pink roses delivered by a florist to Southern Heritage the very day of our mother's funeral and lovingly added them in the blanket of roses that was to be placed on our mother's casket! My siblings and I just cried at the absolute beauty and fragrance of our beloved mother's blanket of roses that Alisa personally saw to being so perfectly gorgeous! A million \"thank you(s)\" does not suffice for the gift of Stephen, Alisa and Leonetta to our family and to all the families blessed to have their amazing help, compassionate hearts, and continued support on this very emotional journey!

My 44 year old daughter was buried at Southern Heritage in Pelham, Alabama on May 18, 2013.  I have had to constantly fight with these  people since that time.  I had to beg them to put sod on her grave; after several months they managed to cover the grave with sod.  After that a large hole appeared at the foot of her grave - it took them several weeks to fill in the hole.  I took my 14 year old granddaughter to the gravesite today (Mother's Day) to visit her mother's grave and we were horrified to see the shape it is in.  There was a pile of old discarded flowers in the back of the headstone, a huge ant bed covered the back of the headstone, weeds and dirt covered every inch of the grave and there are large ruts, which were apparently left by a vehicle of some kind, that circled the grave.  I have constantly called and complained about the condition of my daughter's gravesite and I have been given one excuse after another.  These people have a very flowery presentation and the graves that are close to the entry of the cemetery look good but they have no care or concern for the graves, such as my daughter's, that are out of view.  I would not recommend Southern Heritage to anyone.  I am very hurt by the lack of care and respect we have received from Southern Heritage.\n\nOctober 10, 2018\nThe above posting generated positive changes.  I am not one to compliment basic expectations.  However, with the assistance of Doug Glasscock, General Manager, there have been consistent improvements.  The area of my daughter burial has been well maintained, groomed and cared for.  The area displays the respect and care which should be afforded a loved one. I appreciate Leonetta.  Her position at Southern Heritage is her \"calling\".

Heather initially provided a briefing for veterans on behalf of Dignity Memorial, focusing on benefits the VA provides at time of death.  She followed up with two individual sessions with my wife and me, one at Alabama Heritage Funeral Home and the other in our home.  In the hours she spent with us, we examined everything that Dignity Memorial offers and selected identical plans--cremation with interment of ashes at Alabama National Cemetery at Montevallo.

Michael, Sergio, Mack, Sandra and Jeremy all played a very important part in making the traditional Greek Orthodox funeral service beautiful for our Mother. Their warmth, compassion and desire to make everything to our satisfaction certainly helped ease the pain at this very sad and difficult time.\nHaving lived out of state for over 26 years, handling details can be a challenge. Many thanks to Sergio and Jeremy for going above and beyond to make our plans happen. There are many traditions involved with a Greek orthodox funeral and I am so thankful for aunts and relatives who assisted with those steps. My parents are both part of old, long-time Montgomery families that make up much of the local Greek community. I was comforted by Sandra in the office who was so sweet, understanding and knew my aunt.\nMichael Cox was an excellent funeral director and remained calm and constant throughout the process. He was outstanding at the church and ensured our requests. He lead an informative meeting at the family table to finalize  funeral dollars and expectations. Mack in \"PCP\" was such an easy person to work with, as three of us made sure mom's make-up and dress was just as she would have expected!\nAt 10:30PM after Mom's funeral, I realized that while there were lots of people in attendance, there were many friends about her age that were missing. Having the obituary put on the website was made very clear and that it was at no cost. That's great, but in order to reach more of her target age group the good old newspaper is definitely the best approach!! So many friends reached out when I printed the obituary the day after her funeral. They simply did not know mom had passed away. This leads to my strong recommendation for white-chapel to assist with actually contacting the Montgomery Advertiser and  with submitting the obituary. Of course we are responsible for the cost. I would encourage at least a small informative notice to persons in this age category. I feel there was definite confusion on that situation... at least for ME. Apparently I misunderstood exactly how the newspaper obituary operated.  If I could only re-do that part!!!\nEverything else was absolutely perfect, mom looked beautiful and the flowers were gorgeous (thank you Michele)!! She would approve.\nWith the exception of the disappointing newspaper glitch... I would highly recommend White Chapel-Greenwood Funeral Home services along with their dear and assuring staff.\n\nMany thanks to all!\nSincerely,\nAngela", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81e7b631bacf:0xa863195dd44c65f"}

My father was retired military.  I had no idea that he was eligible for a full military burial including flag folding and presentation, playing of taps, and a 21-gun salute.  Canaan and his supporting staff coordinated everything for the military service.  In addition, his staff ordered a military foot stone.  The day of the service, Canaan organized the pall bearers and instructed them.  And when invited to stay after the service with our family to have lunch at the church, he graciously accepted the invitation.
