Appears that one of their own property managers left a five-star review.  And four of their five-star reviews come from people with the last name Hayley, same as the owner. (Maybe it's a coincidence!) It's almost funny.\n\nRead through these reviews and you'll notice a trend that explains Hayley's poor ratings everywhere: they start with poor quality and end with scamming you out of your deposit. My pregnant wife and I spent 3+ hours on our hands and knees scrubbing our rental house top to bottom before we moved out. It was far cleaner than when we moved in. We discovered $100+ was kept from our deposit because we \"didn't have it professionally cleaned\" -- which is not even a requirement of the lease. I provided photographic evidence that we cleaned up messes that Hayley had never addressed when we moved in, proving that we left the place cleaner than Hayley did. (See photos below for before and after.) Their lawyer said our photos were selective and that we were \"belittling\" their efforts -- says the person who penalized a pregnant woman for cleaning 3+ hours. Nor did Hayley specify what we failed to clean, much less photographic evidence to prove it. All this to say that Hayley appears to automatically deduct $100+ from deposits for cleaning yet doesn't use that fee to clean the place to their own supposed standards.\n\nThis was just the last of many frustrations. Ants and roaches were present when we moved in. Here too we picked up for Hayley's slack and hired exterminators. Hayley's lease requires tenants to maintain the yard but when we moved in, we discovered the yard filled with bamboo and 1+ foot of pine straw (no wonder there were bugs). We asked Hayley to fix it; they sent a maintenance crew that cut the bamboo and left everything else. I spent all week raking it up.\n\nFinally, the property was quite literally rotting on the outside. (Again, no wonder there were bugs.) The owner clearly was attempting to put as little maintenance into the property as possible. I think Hayley is coasting on the Auburn housing market, but it won't take much for a competitor to pick up their slack.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvN2eQVtoi0SQGAcfy6tyL1GD7aSxMtFDS5nyR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSfYxcEl8eRiaOGP1OssoaPdCvsGHf96xhNusd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvQ7HCQqySLqwzzIj8c6iqas_rXgF4NpKj9L1j=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtSfISquaxR8YozlqLVBOYJ2IUaUhwzaAYLeer=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSw48agcU-r-6MKBgRiTUjkbWGuV3PWYknDcww=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9hJgmOGevlVyoSahL4BQ_deo6QZn3dgaSywZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBklQXQranYZFILQmYpaAMjIxW1vyCfFpNfWYZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzAOK_yUoBfVrwwsLXa9E_3ZhjPWJLrS4lTy7U=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8VVTgat3HNyRvPJzk4vn_CiHKXSqBNHgsBTQA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

We had insurance, if they had informed us how bad the leak and water damage was we would have contacted them to come in. Instead two years later we have reports from an environmental mold specialist ongoing us that the upstairs and room beneath where water leaked is covered in black mold.

Haley was paid to do a job and clearly did not. My guess is because they knew we would not be extending our contract at the end of those four months when our sons moved in.

Despite all this, instead of getting our security deposit back, we received a bill stating we owed $1600 in damages BEYOND what our security deposit covered.\n\nWe were surprised to hear this based on how we kept the property, so we requested proof of the damages we were being charged for from Hayley. We were told that we would have to schedule an appointment for that, but any subsequent attempts to schedule an appointment were ignored.\n\nFunnily enough, a friend in the same neighborhood who also rented from Hayley received a very similar bill upon moving out and has had the same experience in being ignored.\n\nIt seems as though Hayley's strategy is to scare young tenants out of their security deposits by asking for a ridiculous amount of money and then silently slinking off with an extra month's rent. To make things worse, this money isn't being used to clean or renovate the properties either, if the state of our property when we moved in is any indication.\n\nSo in summary, just avoid this company. Don't be fooled by the reviews here (if you look closely, almost all of the good reviews are years old with no comments and the recent reviews are much more scathing). You may not have problems right away, but they're bound to arise at some point.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

Even after telling them I had a baby present in the home nothing changed. I was never late on rent and kept my unit clean. When I moved out they were frustrated because i told them I was not resigning my lease due to their lack of care for their tenants.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

I first want to state HMC was very point blank and aggressive and I find them to be unreasonably rude, making use threats and unnecessary means of manipulation to obtain rent EVEN THOUGH I WAS READY AND WILLING TO MAKE A PAMENT. After a recent Identity theft and a severe life threatening illness that left me homebound for several months I was very hesitant to send large amount of money to a company that I had never heard of. All this happened over text message too at that, though they Implied that I(who have had a great rental history prior to my current very difficult landlord) \"Had just been ignoring them and they had been trying to make contact\". All their problems were my fault. They show absolutely no desire and put forward effort to make my rent payment easy to make, just threats. even after the check I wrote them was RETURNED TO ME DUE TO SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. Excuse my language but i didn't even know where the goddam office was. This is an inexpensive company that at the moment appears to care nothing at all about about the well being of their tenants. This is just a personal note, but I can give the impression of that of a low income person in trouble (when in reality that was not the case) and I get the impression that this company has been using the fear and threat of security as a means manipulate their \"less desirable\" clientele regularly for some time now. they seem very practiced. My advice, don't do business with people who use fear as a business model. I will be living my very well enjoyed home to work with a company that values my business and perhaps more importantly, value me as a human worthy of respect.

My daughter lived at this apartment complex for two years. When we got the house assignment before my daughter moved in they had completely changed the type house that my daughter had agreed to rent. Then they said directed me to the place in the least small print where it says they can switch you to any unit they please. There was nothing we could do about it. While we were in the unit the hot water heater was replaced going to a gas hot water heater and because the gas was in my name they charged the hot water heater to my account. It was charged to my gas account and debited out of my checking account, $1800 without my permission. I had to wait three months to be reimbursed and I also had to wait on a coupon from the gas company to be reimbursed. We could not wait to get out of there.\n\n\u2014\u2014I did receive a phone call a few days after posting my review from the corporate office about my negative review. I want to clarify that Spire didn\u2019t charge my account without the On-site management people at Creekside letting the gas company into the home. I nor my daughter was there to let them in and the only people that authorized the charge and transaction was Creekside and Creekside refused to call Spire and correct the problem by billing them or the owner of the condo. Also, the small print indicating they could and did switch the unit that we wanted is a fact and an issue that future tenants need to understand. It makes you realize that they could and did show a nice unit in the style, location, and price and switch you to whatever they want.  They placed our daughter in a unit that was at the entrance to the community, high traffic, high noise, and her Eno was stolen off the tiny porch the first week.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611094898192, "text": "Hi Mrs. Stanfield!

It blows my mind that people write about how the staff is unprofessional and rude.

There is a huge grass area for your pups to play! But most importantly, no matter what issues arose, regarding the neighborhood, my house, other residents, you name it, Kristen went so far ABOVE and beyond to be the most genuinely caring person. She is the sweetest manager you will ever meet. She didn't have to do 99% of what she did for me while I lived there and I can never say thank you enough for the staff of Creekside. Truly a luxury living environment. I spent a couple years living here and never regret it for a minute!! If you are looking for a place to live Fall or Spring you have to look at Creekside or you'll miss out BIG time! Also shout out to Charlie in the front office for helping Kristen pack my WHOLE house and move it to my new unit for me while I was abroad.

Some of it is good, some of it is bad, some of it could go either way depending on what you want out of a place to live, and some of it is just unavoidable as it is targeted to college students.\n\nSome aspects of the property are really nice. The clubhouse is pretty nice (though the weight room is a joke; I don't know why any Auburn student would use it instead of the top notch campus facility). The common areas are generally well-maintained. I say generally because while the landscaping is kept up, the gates are not. I've been trying to get my name added to the call box for three years and it still hasn't happened, yet I know residents that moved out years ago still in the list.  The gates are frequently broken and they keep nobody out. If someone wants to get in, they will get in. They will simply wait for someone to open the gate and go in after them. If you are going to be a \"gated community\" then be a gated community. In my opinion, Creekside should just get rid of the gates because they really don't accomplish anything except annoy the residents.\n\nCreekside does not tow. This could be good or bad depending on your point of view. I never had an issue with parking. On busy football weekends, perhaps I'd be 10-12 spots away from my front door but that was about the extent of it. However, other parts of the complex may not have quite as abundant parking so that could be an issue. I'm really not sure. It was nice to not have to deal with visitor passes, etc. but it would be very frustrating if there wasn't enough parking near your home.\n\nCreekside does not enforce many of its own rules. The one that really annoys me is the pool. It is supposed to be limited to residents and residents are allowed two guests I believe. What it ends up being is tons of people who might know one person in Creekside... or in some cases just show up without knowing anyone. I pay good money to live in a place like this and don't feel like my money should be going to clean up after non-residents who break chairs, leave beer cans and bottles strewn about, etc. Some would say I'm a party pooper... but I like to think of it as being irritated by trespassing. People (many times non-residents) bring beer bottles and dogs to the pool routinely... both are supposed to be fineable offenses... but I've never seen one handed out.\n\nMaintenance is a mixed bag, but mainly poor. To get a broken door repaired, it took about a dozen phone calls over a two month period. Simply absurd. I also reported a broken toilet two different times. Once, it was repaired promptly. The other time... I was told they'd be out there \"in the next couple of days\" and nobody ever came. After about a week, I fixed the toilet myself. Also, I should point out that *OWNERS* are occasionally treated as second-class citizens by the on-site management. Essentially, the homeowner's dues should get me the same rights as the renter's... but when I file a maintenance issue that is supposed to be covered by the HOA dues, they handle all renters first... I guess to make sure they get people to resign because they know the homeowner is unlikely to sell because of a small issue like this. Or, in the vast majority of cases, it isn't the actual homeowner who lives in the house; It is often the parent of one of the residents who probably never even hears about the issue.\n\nThe last issue I have is with the TV/Internet Service. It has been nothing short of awful the entire time I've lived here. In 2015, I don't think people can really appreciate just how bad I have had it and what a negative it is. The internet is slow, often less than 1 megabit/second so forget about streaming Netflix during peak hours; You'll be lucky if you can just get a YouTube video to play in 240p, nevermind HD.\n\nAll in all, it is a decent place to live. You could definitely do a lot worse. I think I'd rather pay for a location closer to campus rather than the resort style amenities, but that is personal preference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586452516041, "text": "Thank you for the valuable information"}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3710357e3:0xc8afc14b7cb32308"}

Oftentimes people who come to the pool don\u2019t even know anyone in the complex (I have no idea how they get in). Adding to their being unwelcome is the fact that they, along with actual residents, throw empty beer cans and cigarettes into the pool, making it disgusting and completely unable to be used.\n\nCreekside also advertises itself as a gated community. Unlike other gated complexes, however, Creekside uses a barcode scan system, which is usually broken. Thus the gates are open 24 hours a day, including weekends. If the gates are closed and the scanner is broken, there is no code to open the gates, which led to three broken gates because of cars driving through them in the year that I lived there. Why they chose a system with no backup way to get in is beyond me.\n\nCreekside is a magnet for irresponsible students who love to party loudly. I did not understand how there could be such a high concentration of people with such habits, but then I discovered that much of Creekside\u2019s advertising involves half of drink specials for residents and other alcoholic incitements. There were obnoxiously loud parties that could be heard two rows of houses over and up the street nearly every weekend and even on weekdays. These parties were rampant with underage drinking and lasted until four a.m. or later. The courtesy officer never picks up his phone, so the police usually come. This is an inconvenience and an annoyance for the officers, especially since Creekside hired someone who is supposedly responsible for taking care of such noise disturbances.\n\nThe Internet is abysmal, and it is nearly impossible to get someone to come out and fix it. Our Internet didn\u2019t work for three months, and the management refused to give us a refund on the portion of our rent that went toward cable and Internet.  They also refused to let us get our own router.\n\nManagement threatens to fine its residents constantly, but never follows up; therefore, what looks like a beautiful complex from outside the gates is full of porches that are littered with beer cans, cigarettes, trash, and beer pong tables. Any complaints about the state of the porches will go unnoticed.\n\nAll in all, Creekside is a place for rich kids whose parents don\u2019t care if they drink excessively underage and blow off classes in the morning due to a midweek party. Were I a parent, no matter how much money I had, I would avoid investing in a unit in Creekside like the plague.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586452699657, "text": "Thank you for your feedback on our college student community."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3710357e3:0xc8afc14b7cb32308"}

We had a roofing company ready to take care of what needed to be done after the adjuster went to your home.  Your father said he had a buddy who was a roofer who could handle the issue.  Your father's roofer is to blame for not removing the wet/molded insulation in the attic.  Your father's roofers did not put the gutters back on after the repair.  You asked us to handle.  Our contractor said the roofer did a sub-par job. You asked us to send everything to your father.  We did as you asked and he blamed us for what his roofers failed to do. You asked us to handle the interior repairs.  Our contractor handled the repairs from the ceiling down (patch and paint).  As we were not provided a copy of the adjuster's report, we had no way to know what was going on in the attic. We are certain you were paid for mold removal/remediation yet you never received a bill/estimate for mold removal/remediation from our contractors. This is an unfortunate series of events that I would like to help you with however you feel the only remedy is for me to take responsibility for something that was mismanaged by you.

I have been renting with them for around 14 months now. If you qualify and meet their standards they are wonderful to work with. If you are paying your rent in full and on time, they will go above and beyond to meet your needs. However, if there is an unexpected life turn, even notifying them will not help. I was laid off at work and could no longer afford the rent. Even their qualifications say that you must make 3x the rent in a months time. I now make less than 2x the rent. I notified them of my life changes thinking that was right thing to do, but as I had forgotten, just remember they have a contract in place and that is what they will go by like any other business. They are still a great company despite my disagreements and misunderstandings on some of their business practices, but if are going into renting with them knowing there is even a possibility of financial changes in your life, I would not recommend them.\n\nAdding in response to owners reply. They did offer me release option, but ultimately that is continuing to pay the rent in full as usual until it is released, sold, or until end of your lease (which ever comes first). This is extremely risky option for someone who cannot afford the rent in the first place. Can\u2019t afford their rent, but they want you to pay two rents while waiting for them to find another person to lease. Great idea guys. Even when I offered to pay 3 months rent, plus them keeping deposit to end lease ( 6400 total).  They claim they can get it leased in a month or two (3200 total) so why not take the 6400 total and let me go? Hmmm, wonder if it\u2019s because they cannot/ or don\u2019t try to immediately lease it out??? Just a thought. You have to move out before they will begin to show, again paying two rents. Not a great option when I cannot afford their rent, so no that\u2019s not helpful as he claims. Not sure how that helps me at all as they are \u201chelping me out of a bad situation\u201d. And I have signed and returned the release option papers, so I am unaware of what that is about. I even got confirmation emails they were received, which I am happy to provide to anyone showing the dates of his post vs the dates of the emails. Also, I highly doubt I am the only person that has gotten frustrated from being in a financially binding situation, so not sure how that deems me the most difficult with this type situation. Again, great company, until you are in a financial situation where you cannot make rent.\n\nUpdate on this (today 7/30/19), as if the owner below saying I did not sign and return the forms in June wasn\u2019t enough, just got a call saying they did not have the forms (supposedly) and could not process anything. I told them I had email confirmation that all forms were received and would be glad to forward that over. Was told that worker was on maternity leave and they could not access email to get the forms. Not sure how that\u2019s my problem??? But sure, I\u2019ll redo everything again since you cannot properly arrange cover while employees are out on leave. \ud83d\ude04", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1561389386223, "text": "Cindy,\nThank you for clarifying the fact that we hold renters to the agreement that they signed.

We weren't sure - the door frame just splintered one day when opening, leaving the lock virtually useless. (The door was not in particularly good shape when we moved in.) We didn't file a police report as there was no evidence that a break in had actually occurred. When Rudulph repaired it and didn't charge us, we thought there was no issue, since nowhere in our lease did it indicate a police report would be necessary. We were a little shocked when we moved out several months later and over $400 was deducted from our deposit specifically for the repair of the door - without prior notification by the property manager of the cost of the repair, which only included a new deadbolt and a patch fix to the door and frame. Upon speaking with Mr. Rudulph, this was how they recouped their investment in the door repair. Maybe this is standard procedure for most leasing agencies, but it seems like bad practice to require your tenants to involve law enforcement before you will pay for repairs to damage they did not cause and that, if not addressed, could endanger their safety.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1407008711852, "text": "Lindsey,\n\nI appreciate your thoughts.

I waited onsite for another 45 minutes and no one ever returned to the office or answered my ticket.

I called the number and I was directed the call center and made an appointment. My friend and I sat outside for 45 minutes before someone came back. When Fredricka returned to the office, she was off the rip rude. I was washing my hands at the sink and I guess that is frowned upon at the Haven apartment complex.\nWhen my friend was explaining the purpose of her visit, Ms. Fredricka was not comprehending anything she was saying. Before viewing the apartments, I gave a suggestion to Ms. Fredricka that she should turn the sign around so people can know she is not in the office at the moment. She explained to me that she didn\u2019t turn it around because she was just getting her lunch. Although she was just getting food and not handling business pertaining to the apartments, she should have still turned the sign around so others can know that she is not in the office.\nWe went and viewed the renovated version of the Madison and it was beautiful. One thing that I might add is that the description of the \u201cpatio\u201d should be worded and explained as a balcony because that\u2019s exactly what it is. The bedrooms in this particular unit is not big enough for the price of rent.  Upon our return to the office to view the other unit, there were people standing outside because once again, the sign was not turned around to inform them that she was on a tour. We went to view the classic version of the Hamilton and how Ms. Fredricka explained this unit is not how I envisioned it. This apartment has cream counter tops and appliances and it is not appealing to the eye at all. The cream appliances and grey cabinets make the apartment look real country. The fridge had rust on the side and I asked Ms. Fredricka if they would replace or paint over this rust stain on the refrigerator should my friend move into this unit. Maybe she did not see nor comprehend what I was saying because she said that this apartment comes with cream countertops and appliances. That\u2019s clearly not what I was asking her. I asked the question again and she seemed perplexed as if I was asking if she personally would replace the refrigerator. When she finally comprehended what I was saying, she explained that no one has ever asked that question but she would have to check into that and see. This whole experience, completely turned my friend and I off from ever thinking about renting apartments from here. I gave it two stars because the first unit we viewed and the property itself is very beautiful.

I must say that the mere fact that they cared enough to watch after my daughter kept me there and I am so grateful. Now there were some flaws but they were always good about getting them fixed, the only recommendation I would make would be to add more light in some places for people who come home late. I truly miss this place and if I could and I am thinking about it I will be back.

I went to Badger Properties because I read good reviews on Google and had heard generally good things from people. I went to the office in person and told Chris \"the badger\" my situation. I was just getting out of a 12 month rehab program, and had been working for a Christian Ministry and looking for an apartment in Auburn since I was a student at Auburn University at the time. I was very up front about my bad credit but was working 7 days a week and had many references etc to back up that I was honest and good for the rent every month. After seeing me alone in his office after hours, and asking me to come along (still alone) with him to see one of the properties (still after hours) I agreed because I was desperately in need of an apartment. He took me to an apartment to collect rent from a girl around my age, then he took me to another apartment where he basically showed me a place and then just sort of \"visited\" with some tenants. Every one seemed to like him, the apartments were pretty nice for how old they are, regardless, I was impressed at the time. We then went back to his office (once again, all happening after business hours) and he gave me an application, but before he did that he sat me down in the seating area of his office. We were completely alone and it was very dimly lit, and the front door was locked. He asked me extremely probing and personal questions about my past drug use. Mind you, I was sober for over a year at this point, active in church (still am) and admittedly hadn't even smoked a cigarette in over a year. He asked me questions like, \"So what led you to do drugs?\" \"what kind of drugs have you tried?\" \"how did you do your drugs? did you shoot up? snort them?\" He just kept asking SO many invasive and frankly, inappropriate questions; it was almost sadistic. I answered them as honestly as possible without divulging too much, because I really needed an apartment, I was impressed by the ones he had shown me and I thought that being as honest as I could would show him that I was a good tenant despite my bad credit, etc. After filling out an application and getting my credit checked through the program he said he uses to run credit (which gave a very vague summary of ones credit) I went back to his office once I had submitted my credit report and application. He said he didn't think he could rent to me because my credit report showed that I was $25k in debt; I explained that those were my student loans and that the program he uses wasn't showing exactly WHAT the debt was, just the amount. He said he couldn't rent to someone who was that far in debt. I explained that I am a student and that those are my student loans. I said, I would get a more in depth credit report and bring it to him. He gave me back my money order with the application fee on it and said to come back with a new credit report. My aunt is a real estate agent and she ran my credit for me, this time I had a complete credit report with every single student loan showing in detail, but because I had now ran my credit twice in one week, my already poor credit score was even lower. Despite that I went back to \"the badger\" and told him that the large amount of \"debt\" he saw was indeed my student loans, which were not even in collection because I was still attending Auburn at the time. He said then said he couldn't rent to someone with a credit score as low as mine and with a history like mine (due to my past drug use I had a criminal record. I have not had a single run in with the law in almost 4 years). So all in all, after wasting time, money, energy and being thoroughly humiliated, I would say that Badger Properties only serves those they deem worthy, and they don't believe in giving people second chances, only sadistically probing and dissecting the past of people who have made mistakes despite turning their lives around. A huge waste of time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459895750596, "text": "After 15 years of running Badger Homes and Badger Properties, I stand by my record of treating all applicants fairly in terms of their qualifications for an apartment.  They area 1) Credit score, from a tenant or direct relative, 2) Academic progress, and 3) good references from their previous landlord.  As stated above, our screening reports DO only show a credit score, they do not show a full report - meaning, we don't know the type of debt.  Our screening criteria is designed to approve or deny based on the SCORE, regardless of the type of debt.\n\nIf this dispute ever got serious, *I could produce a chain of emails which would explain and clearly show the reason for Denial*.  There was never any \"trade\" or \"back door\" approval process offered, and their never has been since I started the business.  We document every case of approval or denial, so we are ready to defend against accusations such as these.  That is not how we operate.  To have one negative review in 15 years should be evidence of how we do things.  Are we perfect?  No.  But we don't run the kind of business we are being accused of in the allegations above.\n\nOn the rehab comment: I can confidently say that we have rented to people coming from / still in rehab programs.  We have also rented to gay, straight, and many different religions and ethnic backgrounds, as well as singles, married couples, singles with kids, and families.  We have rented to people with low credit scores, also, but they must have a direct relative with a qualifying score be screened and sign as a Guarantor for their lease.  Our records are clear on that as well.  The \"second score\" that was brought to me to qualify was well below our minimum qualification.  We require a 650, the score presented was well below 600.\n\nAs stated above, there was not a qualifying score, and possibly not the required academic progress - but maybe\nshe met that qualification, I honestly do not recall.  We do not search any Applicant's criminal record, only our employees.\n\nAs stated above, I DID refund the Application Fee, and provide a true explanation of the reason for denial.  I do not remember asking questions about shooting or snorting drugs - I don't even know enough about drugs to know what that would mean anyway.  I have never even had a beer in my life, which everyone I've known for 41 years can verify.\n\nAfter hours, most (not all) of the lights are off in our storefront office, and the door is usually locked, but it is a full glass storefront on a busy street full of shoppers - so hardly a threatening or scary place.  I admit I probably asked questions that I didn't officially need to ask, true.  I am sorry if doing so had a worse impact than I expected.\n\nI do remember that the reviewer above and I did go to see an apartment and collect rent from a neighbor, but in most cases our rent is paid online, and has been for years.  I always thought that giving tours after hours and visiting with tenants after hours was a sign of good customer service, not something I would have to defend later.\n\nIf an independent auditor surveyed all of our current and previous tenants - male and female - over the last 15 years, they would come up with a conclusion that we are a little slow on maintenance, tough on noise, but that's about it.  If they surveyed everyone that has applied and that we have turned down over the last 15 years, they would find that there was a clear reason for each denial, and it was based on our written requirements of Credit Score, Academic Progress, and References.  That's it.  There is no evil, juicy story to report.\n\nAshley applied to rent from Badger in Sept 2014 for a Dec 14 opening..  I admit, I could have done better with the questions or the office lighting(?), but I have made no further attempt to contact her or to be in her life in any way beyond the Application period.  I am not sure why in April of 2016 she has decided to bring these accusations/allegations."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf31c31a91691:0x5164e38502b4d2b0"}

No one is better than anyone no matter how much money you make, or what you wear, or what you do for a living. We haven't really had that many issues except a few. First of all, we own a dog. A well trained amazing dog. When we saw the house at first, the carpet was terrible. There was a huge black stain on the carpet in the living room and it was coming up at the seams in some places. You could tell the carpet was cheap and old and quite frankly plain nasty. They (owners/tom west) refused to replace the carpet because we had a dog. Also, the kitchen tile was terrible and in some places of the house, you could tell needed to be replaced. Second, We called Tom West a couple months back about a bed bug infestation. When we moved in, we had noticed little bugs a few places, but in the lease agreement, it stated we were to take care of pest control, not realizing they were bed bugs. We did not have bed bugs at our apartment and had verification from the previous landlord. We never called until about a year later when we couldn't get rid of them and they refused to pay to get them removed after we had tried just about everything. Its laughable now because we are moving out and they are still going to have to pay to remove them. Also, in the moving out procedures, you have to pay to get the carpet cleaned. They want me to have that cheap, stained carpet to get professionally clean knowing they are probably going to remove it anyways. We brought our newborn into this home thinking this could be our home for a bit, and now we are moving out 7 months later because it's just what's best. Over all, I would say the company is ok, but pick them last if you have to.

We were told upon moving in to do a walk through and make a list of things that were wrong. We did, and we took pictures and gave them a list of about 15 issues we noticed. We rented a property from them for a year and in that year they fixed one thing off our list. Upon moving out we followed all procedures listed in our rental agreement. Most of the things on our list upon moving in we were charged for when moving out!!!! On top of that they made things up along the way in order to keep our initial deposit of $1150.00. They said that the property had leaks, mold and that we didn\u2019t turn in the keys and garage door opener all of which was untrue. We did not receive ANY of our deposit back plus they tried to tell us we owed an additional $500 +! When we called to tell them to take it out of the deposit they kept they informed us that it was over and beyond that. Then they changed their story to say that when we didn\u2019t turn in our keys(which we did) that we forfeited our security deposit?! When we asked what the additional money was for we also got a different story every time we called....first it was for removal of items(we left hangers \ud83d\ude44) then it was for carpet cleaning....call me crazy but last time I checked neither of these cost 1600 dollars! They then sent us invoices that they had that they said we were being charged for cleaning fees???! Entire house was cleaned and left in better shape than when we moved in. Funny thing being, the three invoices they sent for the work done which was all minor cleaning around the house didn\u2019t even total 500.....do not rent from these lying thieves that cannot keep their stories straight!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892927d935f424d:0x3aa0af9aa07a070d"}

The apartment was NOTHING like the apartment I toured. Besides the apartment not being cleaned (the smell of smoke and plenty of dead bugs everywhere), there were so many inconveniences such as faulty lighting, doors that still do not function correctly (closet and room doors were not made to close or lock for some reason) and horrible appliances.\n\nBut by far, what really made the apartment horrible is the infestation of ROACHES and CONSTANT WATER SHUTOFFS.\n\nSince day one, roaches have been a huge problem throughout the apartment. Every night there would be multiple roaches throughout the apartment, even after constant cleaning and spraying my own pest control. It was so disgusting to the point where I never cooked in the kitchen after the first month (that still didn\u2019t stop the roaches though). One night, a Valet trash employee even told me that this complex had a terrible roach problem.\n\nAs far as the water, you can expect to go without water in the entire apartment for at least 3-5 days every month. I can guarantee it. This may not sound like a lot, but for this to be your \u201chome\u201d, being without water for random, unplanned periods of time is completely UNACCEPTABLE!\n\nPlease save yourself the trouble and look for a better option.

But it\u2019s not, MAKE SURE BEFORE YOU MOVE IN THAT YOU ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT UTILITY PACKET IN THE BEGINNING because it sounds are nice but they defer you 2 months and then come back and charge you those two months in the end. YOU WILL THINK YOU ARE GETTING A GREAT DEAL UNTIL YOU GET TIL THE END ITS DECEIVING. THAT UTILITY DEFERMENT SHOULD BE AN OPTION AND NOT A SURPRISE WHEN ASKED WHAT I NEED TO PAY TO MOVE OUT, because If you are prorated at the end, your rent shouldn\u2019t be 400 dollars more then your other months living there. That\u2019s how they get you. The day I moved out was a Saturday and to my surprise the rent off was closed and I was not notified. THEY DID NOT INFORM US THAT NEW MANAGEMENT HAD TAKEN OVER AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE OPEN ON SATURDAYS ANYMORE When I call that Monday, I\u2019m informed that oh they told the other woman that was moving out on the same day as me, but I was failed to be notified. So I wasted 2 hours of that day just sitting at the office because maybe I thought the person was just on the property showing a model or at lunch. Nope. I was told I could use my deposit to pay my final balance for the utility BS, and that they were changing system and would be called from Carlton Equities, NOPE I HAVENT GOTTEN A CALL YET. I had to search for their number online only to be answered by someone that just says hello, like it\u2019s their personal cell phone. My name was not asked or anything. They just told me oh well look into it and sorry for the unprofessionalism. MY LAST 2 MONTHS WERE THE ABSOLUTE WORST, there were places in the apartment that they were fixing the road because of their water pipe busting all the time, and the road stayed messed up for I SWEAR 2 months, just cones in the street. LASTLY, I hope no one is every talking a shower and washing their hair because they will turn off the water and not give you a bit of notice at all. THEY DIDNT LIKE COMING TO GET YOUR TRASH SOMEDAYS. For 981 dollars, THE THINGS WE DEALT WITH WAS JUST HORRIBLE. Not to mention When I got into the apartment an dining room light bulb had broke and I could never replace it because the screw in was stuck, the carpet was god awful, so I had to spend 2 of my final days deep conditioning and cleaning to floors. When I spoke with other apartment they always said I\u2019m so sorry that Arlington was your first experience in living on your own. THEY CHANGED MANAGEMENT LIKE 3-4 TIMES.

They have changed management staff more times than I can count since we have moved in 3 years ago. Maintenance has only gotten worse since the last change in management. We use to be able to have maintenance come out here same day that we called about an issue. However recently none of our issues are getting resolved and no one is coming out. The roaches are a huge problem for one, it doesn't matter how often we have pest control come out or how often we spray around, the roaches don't stop. They pretty much live in the walls and no one seems to be doing anything about that.\nThe last couple of weeks our dishwasher has been overflowing and not draining. We've had someone come out to \"fix\" it twice by just draining the water manually, and we've been calling almost every day for the last 1 1/2 weeks to get someone back out here because it got worse after whatever he did. It's now flooding all over our floor anytime we turn it on. And everytime we call and they pick it up, which they don't always do, they say \"We'll get someone out there today\" and literally no one ever comes and it's the same repeat process every single day. Our hot water has been out for a few days now as well, and not a single person has come by to fix it. You would think hot water would be considered an urgent issue, but I guess they don't care and only want your rent money. Which by the way they slowly increase with each lease thinking no one is going to notice. It's gone up $120 total within the last few years. Our front door issue is another we have tried to get fixed. You can see and feel the outside light and weather from the inside. Summer time gets hot and the air conditioner stays on almost all day, raising our electricity bill. And winters stay freezing cold and the heat stays on all day. They need to replace the whole door but instead they always put a band aid on everything they touch. We've had someone come out at least 5 different times to fix our lock on the door because the door wouldn't even close shut all the way. If they really care about their residents they would do what is necessary to get a problem fixed, not just keep doing the same cheap thing over and over and over.\nReally we didn't have many issues when we first moved in. It's been getting worse and worse each year and i'm finally fed up with it. They don't always answer the phone and they haven't responded to any emails. PLEASE DO NOT MOVE HERE.

The problem was, I knew nothing of the \"Magic City\" or its neighborhoods. But on the same day I received the offer for the new job, I realized I needed to find a place, and fast. So I downloaded an apartment app and started searching. I had decided on one criteria. I wanted to walk to work.  That should be easy, I thought, there are a tone of loft apartments downtown. The problem is that the large majority of them were black boxes. To this day. I don't know how one would go about taking a look at and discovering availability on these lofts. Without being overly conspiratorial, I will say that to this day I have doubts about the ethics, motives and business practices of so many of these downtown apartments. I still don't know how to crack those black boxes. There was one huge exception. There was a company that managed a couple of downtown lofts that were located less than a five minute walk from my workplace. When I called them and left a message, they called me back in less than 5 minutes. So that same day, I arranged to meet with their guy, Andrew, who would show me some two-bedroom lofts available at both Goodall-Brown and Fix Play. I immediately fell in love with the 3rd floor loft that would become my home for the next year. I loved the rooftop lounge and the apartment's Modern Amenities with exposed brick, 14 ft ceilings with exposed pipes and ducts and beautiful original hardwood floors, as well as my favorite feature, \"the stairs to nowhere\", which became my meditation space, is all I needed to remind me I was not living in an apartment \"complex\". I was home.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that as someone with a less-than-perfect credit score, Goodall-Brown lofts management company, SPM, was great to work with to get my contract through and approved, as they provide options that most companies do not. They also offered me free rent for the remainder of the month, which I totally took advantage of.  In a few weeks I was moved\n\nAlthough I am not a dog owner, I have really enjoyed getting to know my neighbors and their furry friends. They both, the neighbors and their pets, were amicable and friendly as we constantly ran into each other in the elevator.\n\nI also think the  Goodall Brown Lofts are in the absolutely best location to make the most of downtown living in Birmingham. Within 1 block you can walk to El Barrio, Bamboo, Atomic Lounge and Collins bar. Heck, the Wine Loft is in the SAME BUILDING. Within 4 blocks you can add more than a dozen other fantastic bars and restaurants, like Queens Park, Paramount, East West, The Florentine, John's City Diner, The Essential, Pilcrow, Cayo Coco. I have drank or dines at every one of these places and have yet to be disappointed.\n\nIn regards to the management company, I'll never forget that time a few months that I accidentally dropped my keys down the door crack  of the elevator shaft. (Don't ask, but I could hear them banging all the way down to the first floor) Sheepishly I put in a maintenance request on the website and then followed up with a  phone call the next day. Only a day later, Paris, the delightful general manager for SPM, who is a busy lady responsible for a handful of properties, knocked on my door, my keys in hand. She had had to call the elevator company to retrieve them.  I asked her how much I owed her for that service. She waved my question away. \"It's fine\", she said. Needless to say, they are a responsive company when it comes to service calls\n\nI decided in October that I wanted a bigger place and preferably a house. So I found the perfect place and have moved out of Goodall-Brown  as of early December. I know that it was the right decision for me, but that doesn't change the fact that I miss my beautiful loft and the fun of downtown living.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdiCRYM-UrdJtsgU3JhMuLMK9_BZlZ2_0qskFV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbnWvkLify3SF0Bm2vCyROizYfMjXWmcjtHzKo=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5JQOodrzB7ayy-735-HEcs-A-QUiu8H1Epf29=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrQd0fsEaMk13o543mgnzhoxiAO6f_kLrGHu_X=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMa6Gq27BY_a-Am4v2LjXTPXCS0LvNyGe2QVavB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH22sHV7uTr4r5TqqUaWdUgvYqFwUT5NoWSqfP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUHRC_u1wxyN2TSiJcz5aWfragpzTxVbwAUGwU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpBexkOHDpIKt7SFGJ1R8gBRkC_TwspAgdBBBk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxWD55qu_BJwT4XyKXVxicSfjfFY8Jhy2zjOOY=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2F9F1xwsNhAhy4_jIZrD7WJMpd6d8JkRgSCiI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb14_TNXqyjxfvVzYgINrL8ZfitePJanPwUFX0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1608227254215, "text": "Scott, thank you for this truly thoughtful five-star review of Goodall-Brown Lofts!

Being a former Realtor myself in Tennessee, I'm aware of the responsibility an agent has to their client.  When we hired Mr. Stanton, we were pleased with his feedback and demeanor.  As time passed the feedback, both from his weekly calls stopping and the review emails from the property viewings, slowed down significantly, however we would still consider it satisfactory.  Throughout listing our property with Mr. Stanton, we provided him with all of the information he requested.  However, 36 hours from closing, we were told that we would have to pay our property pool assessment to the tune of $4700.  It was our understanding this would be assumed by the new buyers.  At first he said that he didn't want to go around and around if we told him or not (which we did upon hiring him), but he was aware of our other assessment, so the logic of knowing one but not the other makes no sense.  As I stated in an email to him, even if we pretend that we didn't pass along the information, he's presented himself as one of the most knowledgable and successful agents in the area with lot of experience at the Gulf Shores Plantation.  How would an expert agent who does business there all the time, not be aware to ask about an assessment that began a year and a half ago, which all units there had.  He then proceeded to tell us that he checked on it and the assessment was non-transferrable and could not be assumed by the buyer, which we double checked with our HOA and that was untrue.  We had to pay it because our agent didn't negotiate that on our behalf in the contract.  We gave him a grace period to do something to make it right and were basically told that it just was what it was.  Instead, Mr. Stanton tried to force the situation/closing like everything was common practice.  Had any effort been shown to correct this or any financial responsibility whatsoever been taken, we absolutely wouldn't have posted reviews on every website we could.  As we indicated to the company before closing, with this not happening, we felt like we needed to let our HOA, others rental services and the general public know our experience with Mr. Stanton and Exit Realty.\n\nOne of their brokers/owners stepped in to call us to see what could be done and apologized repeatedly, saying he believed it was an honest mistake and that it has changed how they will do things in the future.  He said on all future transactions, they will have a disclosure form for things like assessments.  First, I am shocked that's not already common practice as I know in Tennessee everything has a disclosure.  Second, I am glad that this error may have changed how Exit Realty does business, but it was at $4700 of my expense.  We hope this helps anyone who is looking to list or buy in the future and will assist you in assuring the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0546b1066981:0xc327fec7a2544bfa"}

While they look like pretty luxury apartments, everything is very cheaply made. We had 2 doorknobs completely fall off in both units. In the second unit we lived in, the doorknob to the bedroom was already hanging off completely. Maintenance isn\u2019t great. While they\u2019re nice, they don\u2019t actually fix anything until they have to. We had the heat and AC break at least 12 times before they finally replaced a part to actually fix it. Often in 90-100 degree weather when we were trying to work from home.\n\nThe management had maintenance keep up the grounds to an annoying and unnecessary degree. Ive been power washed when stepping out of my front porch. The halls reek of gasoline once a week so bad it comes in the apartment bc they leaf blow constantly. They are obsessed with keeping up appearances but don\u2019t actually fix the important things.\n\nThe gates worked ONE day in the 2 years I lived there, no joke. We chose that place because it was a gated community. It is not a gated community, and it is not safe. There were constant break-ins in cars and apartments. One car was set fire and literally reduced to ash. The management would do nothing. No security, no cameras, no gates. They would however send an email every once in a while explaining that they aren\u2019t liable for breaks ins and they keep up \u201ccertain security measures.\u201d And that any breaks ins are our responsibility? Also there are no security measures, as I stated. They also are terrible at managing packages and deliveries.\n\nThey charge you $25 a month for valet trash, but they only take one bag and often skip MANY days, and the dumpster is usually full. So we\u2019ll get an email saying \u201cdon\u2019t leave your trash outside the door, the dumpster is full and valet isn\u2019t coming.\u201d so we\u2019re expected to keep bags of trash inside for days? No one would, of course.\n\nThey don\u2019t let dogs off leash and yet put tons of large obstacle course things in the one, TINY area for dogs. So now dogs can\u2019t even run around in there. No one\u2019s dogs would do obstacles of course, so no one goes to the \u201cpark\u201d (tiny fenced in area) anymore. There\u2019s no nearby roads good to walk dogs.\n\nNeighbors are mostly med students living of their parents money. Seriously. Everyone drives very VERY fast through the property, even though there\u2019s always someone walking their dog. People tail you like crazy, everyone\u2019s just pretty rude. I\u2019ve also seen a couple of med students just swing their car door open and hit the car next to them without caring. It\u2019s a pretty stuck up community.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s hardly ever available parking. The lot is almost always full when you come home at night. Very hard to find parking.\n\nThe management is not helpful at all. While they are friendly, it\u2019s absolutely a front. If you ask for help, they suddenly become cold and unreasonable. Very two-faced. They just don\u2019t care and are actually pretty rude if you ask for ANY help.\n\nDefinitely the worst management I've ever dealt with.

We rented our home in Birmingham after an out of state job transfer and hired AHI to manage the property. There was little to no communication about maintenance issues until the deposit of our rent would be short at the end of the month. Billing was done months later about repairs we weren't told about. I sent email after email to the maintenance team and wouldn't receive a response for months, if at all. We asked for the house to be inspected every six months - that didn't happen either. The one time it did (nine months after the initial request) we were told everything was fine in the house, specifically that the carpet and walls looked good. When our tenants vacated 60 days later, AHI came up with a laundry list of issues that needed to be addressed. When I asked why the discrepancy, we were told that some tenants try to hide damage during inspections. But the things AHI recommended addressing were the carpets and painting the walls in the entire house! How was that \"hidden\" during the inspection? This was the final straw and we terminated our relationship with AHI. Now that we're selling the house, we have to spend even more money to repair issues AHI never told us about.

I called one day and the maintenance guy said the tenant had moved out, and I was like \"what?!\" Anyways, none of the managers would field my questions and only the administrative staff and maintenance workers would call me back, and I'm not a difficult person, the management here is just extremely poor.

This is my third property management company and I cannot begin to talk about the difference in the work that this company has done for me, compared to the other property management companies that I have used in months and years gone by.\n\nFirst, I want to say thanks for having me at a near 100% occupancy rate and a mid 90% collection rate and for handling the tough calls on the nights and weekends that my previous companies either did not handle, did not handle well, or did not handle with the finesse required to keep my tenants happy. I have found the staff at AHI to be extraordinarily professional and willing to rent properties in neighborhoods that other companies have chosen to whine and complain about. Not only have they rented them, but they have collected the revenue that others said they could not collect.\n\nTheir software program has allowed us to see every transaction in a transparent way and to know where every dime of our rental proceeds is going, at the moment that it is going there. I think that this company will continue to grow and I am very fortunate to have found them.\n\nI told them that if I could ever serve as a person to recommend this company, I want to be such a person.

I am sorry to hear that you experienced these issues. Your lease began on April 1st. On April 6th you contacted us with complaints about the smell of mold and the condition of the water heater. We considered this to be an emergency case and immediately contacted the homeowner. A vendor was approved to visit the property. Upon inspection the tech found no odor that would be related to organic matter. The home was in need of a good cleaning but there were no visible signs of organic matter as well. The water heater was unable to be checked due to no power being on in the home, the tech did check for leaks and found none in its current state. Other issues throughout the home were noted and included in an estimate, the owner approved for all repairs to be made at your earliest convenience. You refused to schedule with the vendor and requested to terminate the lease. The owner approved your request on April 15th, we are currently in the process of closing your account.

After they were required to vacate the premises the disposition was proceeded with. The charges assessed to the past tenant exceeded the security deposit funds. The security deposit totaling $950.00 was to be sent to you as the homeowner. However, this balance was applied towards the outstanding balances on your account. The following charges on your account were the following; $55.00 for an estimate fee, management fees from June - October, and a portion of your re-keying of the property. Please be advised, their is still a balance owed on your account for this re-key of the property. Please submit a payment for this outstanding balance on your account.

Took almost a year to renovate but everything is beautiful. However, the transition to a new wifi had left me unable to work from home or do schoolwork because of the terrible connectivity. I can barely even watch tv on my Xbox since they switched the network. I have called white sky and nothing helps. They installed the wifi in a terrible place so I can\u2019t even connect a router to extend the signal. White sky person came and recommended that I run a cord from the kitchen to the other side of my apartment. Never had these issues when we had Xfinity and it was much nicer. The apartment is overpriced for students not to even have good wifi and there aren\u2019t any Ethernet ports to hardwire internet. It is not a hardware issue. My TVs and Xbox are brand new and I had NO issues with xfinity for the 2 years we used them. As you can see in my pictures sometimes the connection drops just minutes between.\n\nUPDATE: The owner of my condo is now trying to move us out. The office has sent people up here AGAIN to work on the WiFi and they said the issue was not the WiFi but my usage.

The renovations that should\u2019ve been finished weeks ago are just being completed. Or, in the case of the gym, these renovations haven\u2019t even started, which will prove to be a great disadvantage to the new residents moving in in 2 weeks.

Changing a few appliances and putting wooden floors in the bedrooms is not worth an extra $150, especially when many residents provide their own furniture. Lastly, Molly Daniels, the regional manager at Vie, had been anything but helpful in this process.

We waited just to move into a dirty apartment. Nothing was prepared for us. The mailbox key was the wrong key and the mailbox was broken so we couldn\u2019t get our mail, and of course we were waiting on something important to be delivered. We didn\u2019t have a gate opener so we had to use a code that worked half the time. When I finally received a gate opener it didn\u2019t work because they didn\u2019t activate it. The gate is trash and stopped working. Then our laundry room was flooding b\\c of the air conditioning. We had to call them 3 times before they actually fixed it, just for it to happen again months later. We paid rent EVERY month ON TIME but they would put all the rent either on my account or my room mate\u2019s account so we would get eviction notices. This has happened at least 6 out of the 9 months we have lived here. Then they decide they want to take up the carpet and replace it with something else while we\u2019re still living here!! They kept changing the date so the day ends up being on a week where I have worked three 16-hour days plus I have back issues and need an operation so I\u2019m having to try and move all my stuff out of my room and closet so they can do something they could\u2019ve done after we leave this place!! Which just made my pain worst. For a month or two they had no groundskeeper so there was dog feces all over the property!! Everywhere you stepped you were likely to step in it. The tub is made of horrible material and is terribly hard to clean. The faucet in the bathroom has been leaking since I moved in. The walls are thin and you can hear the people upstairs. The dryer is trash and you have to dry your cloths twice just to get them dry. There\u2019s no button for the garbage disposal. This place is trash for the cost!! They only care about the money not the residents!!

My overall experience here was above average and I did enjoy living at Vie at University Downs, but it was a roller coaster. The staff is AWESOME. Nothing else to say there, they are all really good people and willing to help. I moved in fast and it was very easy, especially from a gentleman named Rulondo who helped me numerous times during my residency. Also, I want to emphasize how impressed I was with the security in the complex. There are numerous guards roaming and keeping watch, I felt very safe here.\n\nIn the units, the floor layouts are nice and the rooms are pretty spacious, the living/dining room especially.\n\nI did however, have a few things I\u2019d like to share. The first negative experience I had was after I was all moved in, I realized my apartment\u2019s living room and dining room was unfurnished. I was informed that when the new ownership took over earlier in 2018, they furnished every unit with furniture. The one I lived in however, had a resident who had been in there prior to the change in management and had personal furniture already in his room. They told him that In order to get the living room stuff: couch, chair, television, tv stand, dining room table, chairs (basically everything one would need in a living space), that he must also accept the bedroom furniture. This meant he had to move all of his stuff out of there. Since he already had everything he needed, he declined.\nIronically, the other two bedroom units were furnished but the living room was still left empty. I tried numerous times to get furniture in this apartment but it felt like the staff really didn\u2019t care about doing this and just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I was told numerous times that because we had already \u201copted out\u201d of receiving furniture months ago, there was \u201cnothing they could do.\u201d Also, I know for a fact there was a plethora of extra furniture available. I let it go because I only signed a short term lease but to me this was unacceptable and simply just laziness on the management\u2019s part.\n\nIn October, the whole complex underwent a network change to a company called Single digits. In summation, we were without internet connection for about two weeks and even after everything was \u201cfixed\u201d I still experienced issues. I discussed this with the staff and I can vouch for them that they did everything they could to get it up and running as fast as possible. However, I don\u2019t know if they made the correct decision going with this company.\n\nSomething minor, but I felt necessary to be addressed is there are a lot of bugs. I am aware this was a problem a long time ago and the staff has previously addressed this, but I still had numerous experiences. Ant infestations: One in my bedroom from the trashcan and one in the kitchen pantry. This was fixed easily by a few and traps but still gross and took a while to clean up the dead ants. I am not sure if the property had been treated for bugs but mine definitely wasn\u2019t, not to mention that there were roaches in the kitchen, often.\n\nAfter seeing what other apartment complex\u2019s are like. Yes, I had a few complaints, but I want to make sure the management can see these because feedback is a great way to improve. Vie at University Downs does have a lot to offer and it was a nice place to live. With a few fixes and changes, this place has the potential to be a top notch choice for living in Tuscaloosa, but changes definitely need to be made. They are upgrading the clubhouse and I assume it will be very nice.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583962215841, "text": "Thank you so much for your useful insights.

I moved in late September to a 3 bedroom unit. However my garbage disposal has constantly went out every month, my hot water heater leaks onto the floor in the washing room and the dryer has to be rigged to keep running and this is just the beginning. I was moved into a unit that was already occupied in which it states on our move in lease if you moved in during the month of august you have 72 hours to get the lights in your name. So I think my apartment already has a power account attached to it that I just have to pay on. I gave something one month however in the month of December my power has been turned off due to it not being in someone's name. I was never notified of ANY of this and to make matters worse neither one of the two people I live with will reply to my text messages nor my calls. I'm just ready for my lease end honestly. If you already have roommates maybe it's not that bad but this is a very unacceptable situation. And to make matters worse the best option the leasing office could give me was to pay the start up fees and bill for Alabama power and bring in the bill and they will charge it to my roommates accounts. First off I shouldn't have to handle this myself, second off why would I want to continue staying in a unit where I can't get a answer from either one on A matter as serious as this.

I went on about thirty different tours of different complexes in Tuscaloosa to view one bedroom apartments as this was my only option due to the issues I had leading me to needing a place. To say the least a majority of the apartment options in this town are sketch especially when its last minute last chance in May. However when I came to the downs, Bronson took me and my mom and sister on a tour and it was a great experience. I wanted to see the type of unit I would actually be living in as opposed to just a model unit and they understood my concerns so they made it happen. One of the other employees, Jade, let me go into her apartment and see what it was like since that would be the layout I would ultimately end up with, without hesitation or second thought. I ended up signing for this current year and have been here since August. I have nothing but great things to say about the office staff especially Andrew who truly makes anyone's day each time you see him. Being so far away from family no matter what year you are in is always hard but the staff always is so welcoming and caring. When you read other reviews they talk about disasters of maintenance and such where their needs aren't attended to but I have not seen where that's an issue. Like normal there are always going to be household things that need fixing no matter where you live, its just a part of life and being a tenant. I have had my fair share of unwanted critters (yikes its ok I am alive still) or leaks/minor breaks but no matter what the office always responded fast and urgent for me. People fail to forget that its usually just one person, Ryan, doing all the repairs so they need to cut him some slack and be understanding that the issue will be addressed quickly but maybe not immediately. As far as safety goes, I feel secure at the apartment and the one incident where I was nervous about someone near my apartment I called the office and legitimately a golf cart, and I am talking like one of those extended ones, full of staff came zooming in and investigated and checked in on me to make sure I was okay, including Taylor Duncan the leasing manager too. I find that the staff really makes the living experience worth while at apartment complexes which is why I gave 5 stars overall. I had a few hiccups here and there with maintenance or billing like I mentioned but those issues were resolved to a level of satisfaction which is the part that matters most. Now that this novel of a review is over have a great day and if you are in a predicament where you need not just a house but a home stop on over here at UD!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1518124468038, "text": "Thank you Tiffani Greene for sharing your fantastic experience with us.

When I first began paperwork with them they were undergoing renovations, which at the time was exciting to see. When I came in a couple weeks later to finish my paperwork they had lost it! Papers that had my entire identity plastered all over them as well as my co-signers (parents) info! This happened TWO more times. When everything was finally taken care of I had signed during an incentive to get a $600 dollar gift card or use it as credit towards my first months rent, so being the poor college student that I am I put it towards my rent, well when it came time to pay first months rent they told me I couldn't use that incentive because I was in a privately owned unit. Why would you assign a resident who signed during an incentive special, a condo that's privately owned therefore cancelling out that incentive?\n\nIt's just one inconvenience after another with these guys. Probably because they can't get a property management company to stick around long enough for things to flow smoothly. University Downs has gone through three ownerships since I've been involved with them. The staff is almost entirely undertrained or under-qualified to be handling the responsibilities they're supposed to take care of with ease. Nearly every question is answered with \"I'll have to check with my manger when they get back\". Which then leads to nothing because the manager is never around.\n\nAlso if you're planning to live on the condo side rather than the apartment side then please know that all those inclusions they promise like wifi/cable or Google Chromecast are NOT included. They didn't share that until after we had signed or lease.\n\nTruly an awful experience. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for housing. Aside from the awful management the condos are higher quality builds than most of the newer places, however be prepared to do all of the move-in cleaning yourself, I've never seen such a gross move-in room.

However, my experience with University Downs in Tuscaloosa has been an absolute nightmare. The experience has been so negative that it warrants more than just a bad review, but also legal action.\nAfter the new management company (Asset Campus Housing) bought the complex from Ellis-Trick, all of the services went downhill. From trash pickup to rent payment every facet of life at UD changed for the worse. Most importantly, the management staff (not necessarily the office staff) has been unhelpful, incompetent, and downright rude.\nFirst, even though my name was on the lease (I am looking at a copy right now), my name was NEVER put into their system, so every time I called they couldn\u2019t speak with me (or pull up my lease apparently). Furthermore, they never put any of the emails on my lease into their system. When my roommate wrote a check for $785 instead of $795 on accident, we were never notified of the \u201clate payment\u201d either by phone or email \u2013 even though they had both. So they after a few months that $10 charge grew into hundreds. They then had the audacity to place an eviction notice on my door. So they can walk to my apartment to threaten eviction but they can\u2019t notify me of a $10 dollar payment??? Needless to say I paid the $10 dollars I owed them, but not a penny more! And I wished it ended there\u2026\nWhen I moved to a different city over the summer (and paid two rents because I didn\u2019t want to sublease!) they actually moved another person into my apartment!!!! I found out about this when I went back to my apartment on checkout day (to turn in my key) and there was someone else living in there with all their stuff! I have had two UD employees acknowledge this, but they don\u2019t see a problem with it at all \u2013 even though I was still paying rent!\nFinally, after months of phone calls, emails, and weeks on end of no response, I still have not received my security deposit back. They have acknowledge \u2013 finally \u2013 that they owe me the security deposit, but now they said they \u201cmailed the check.\u201d That was over three weeks ago. This is on the point of ridiculous. The managers at the office do not care. They are rude and completely unprofessional. I have friends who have been through similar experiences at UD! And you should understand. I took pride in my apartment. It was always clean inside and out, and well taken care of.\nI could go on for another page or two\u2026\nI am going back to Tuscaloosa in a few years, and they could not PAY ME to live there.\nFinally, apparently the complex is being purchased by a new company in 2016. Don\u2019t live there!!! They are keeping the same rude and unprofessional managers \u2013 so nothing will change.

The appliances all do not work correctly. Staff/maintenance comes in whenever (literally they will knock and, from the back bedroom, not give us enough time to put pants on and go open the door before they are already letting themselves in) to fix or change things without even telling residents. They have just come in our place numerous times this year with numerous excuses. They tell you they would give residents a heads up if they have to come in, but that is not true. One day while we had multiple friends over, they came in and said they had to paint all our walls. Needless to say, that was the final straw and we told them they could not paint that day randomly without telling us, while we had people over. We live on the second story and one morning we were woken up at 8 am bc some workers had climbed up the back balconies and were on our back porch working, of course without telling us. I have never lived somewhere where maintenance just comes in without warning so many times in a year. Our friends have a joke going on about hanging at our apartment because maintenance will probably be joining us. Also, one day when they randomly came, we had an empty cat litter box. No cat, not cat toys/food, not even cat litter, just the empty box, and then they tried to charge us $500 by saying we had a pet and kept coming by randomly to catch a nonexistent cat in our place. Even then, $500 seemed like much for a cat. Another thing, along with not telling any residents about maintenance coming to do anything in residents places, they have also decided to change the internet connection and password without telling residents. We went almost a week, a school week without internet is very difficult, thinking the internet had gone out without being fixed. We finally called and they told us it had been changed. We told them we were not happy they would do that without telling us, therefore making us go without. The next day, after we had gone the week without internet and then resolved the issue, they came by and put a paper in our door telling us they changed the internet, so at least our complaining did something, even if it was a week too late.\nOverall, you will not have the privacy you want in your apartment and do not count on the staff/maintenance to do great jobs.

It has been nothing but problems since day one. Sandra/Sandy wants to try to talk to you any kind of way. She popped up at my house/trespassing taking pictures of my vehicles in my back yard that was being worked on AND put notices on my cars that she was going to have them towed in seven days if i didn't move them myself. She wanted me to show her that each vehicle had a current tag and insurance. NONE OF THAT WAS NO WHERE ON MY RENTAL AGREEMENT BUT HER OWN PERSONAL PREFERENCE which I totally ignored. I talked with an attorney at legal aid who told me to write her a cease and desist letter for her to stop harassing me, stop trespassing, and to give me written notice when she wanted to do an inspection according to my rental agreement and to let her know that I would press charges on her criminally and sue the rental company if she towed ANY of my vehicles. She also keeps billing me bogus late fees and threatening to file eviction on me if I don't pay them. My attorney through legal aid had me to give him the documents so he can sue them to get my money back when I move out. They tried to bill me for a Rotor Rooter bill when sewer was emptying in the front yard for negligence when MAWSS/Mobile Water came out three weeks later and fixed the sewer line that was broken and was reported by a meter reader that sewer was seeping out into the street. I tried to give the rental office a courtesy call to let them know that Rotor Rooter had bogus billed them because MAWSS said they had to know the sewer line was broken and just did a temporary fix instead of calling MAWSS like they were supposed to do. Robert played dumb like he didn't remember me calling. I'm glad that I took pictures to give to my attorney because they were trying to change me a $680 bill that I don't owe. I gave Robert my January rent check and a 90day notice that I was moving when my lease ends in March. I only had to give a 30day notice according to my rental agreement BUT he claimed yesterday that he didn't receive the notice to vacate and Sandy was talking like I wouldn't be able to move. I shut them down quick letting them know that I only had to give a 30day notice and yesterday was just the 15th of February so they was still receiving the notice ahead of time. It's comical on how I guess they think that I'm an idiot when I'm far from that. I really tried to go with the flow for the sake of peace but not at the expense of my money, peace, nor respect. I can imagine what I'm going to have to go through to get my WHOLE deposit back but my attorney assures me that he had my back.\n***UPDATE***\nThey FIRED Sandra/Sandy and that was the best thing that they could have done. The WHOLE office and atmosphere is very different and professional in a positive light. Deborah and Ashton were very helpful, professional, and knowledgeable and they righted ALL of Sandra/Sandy wrongs most importantly stating that I wasn't responsible for that Rotor Rooter bill. I'm not being harassed nor receiving anymore pop up visits nor any bogus charges nor late fees because NOW I can conveniently by my rent online. I can even put in maintenance repair requests online and be contacted the very next day. YES, I'm still renting from them and I have so much peace.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e2dcdfc10f7:0xc56f84e23996cb84"}

With the exception of maintenance, when I would contact the company, I was usually met with unprofessional customer service or simply did not receive responses. Even while I was giving my 30 day notice, it took me 4 attempts to contact them, twice via email and twice via phone, to receive any information or paperwork.\n\nAfter a storm caused our oven to need to be replaced, it took the company 30 days to finally get us a new oven. I called appliance companies that confirmed they could have gotten us the oven in a third that time even with shipping. When I asked for a concession to compensate for this major inconvenience, I was told that as long as they showed they were making progress, they didn\u2019t owe any concession.\n\nWhen leaving the house, we were given a bill for our entire security deposit plus several hundred more dollars. This is especially frustrating considering that, with the exception of one portion of wall damage that can be fixed with half an hour of labor, all of the damage to the house was either prior damage (which they told me they had catalogued and which should have fixed in between tenants) or normal wear and tear. I never expected to get my whole deposit back, but considering the care and attention we gave to taking care of the house, I was incredibly disappointed.\n\nIn conclusion, if you would like to rent from Becky Hancock, I highly recommend you put aside money for a lawyer or a large payment at the end. But frankly, you\u2019re better off never dealing with this company. Since I have moved, I have only had great experiences with my new property managers.

This is the best thing about this company. Aside from that our, there are many other aspects to consider when selecting a company to oversee your investment when you are not able to do so your self.\n\nI am very confident that the managers never once stepped foot in our property while there were tenants occupying the property. This was huge to us as we found many items that were damaged and not functioning after arriving back 6 years later.\n\nThe quality of cleaning and repairs when the turned the property back over to us was very bad. We had to completely re-clean the entire place. There were many items that required repair, to include the HVAC system and the sprinkler system.\n\nPros:\n- 90% occupancy rate at or above market value.\n- Never missed a payment.\n- Online management software makes it easy to keep track of financial records\n\nCons:\n- Did not uphold their end of the co tract with respect to quarterly visits to the property.\n- Terrible job keeping up with the condition of the property an appliances. (Preventative maintenance)\n- Very bad post rental cleaning standards. I am sure they require more from the tenants when they move out then they actually did for us. Black grout lines, carpet required replacing. Almost the entire place HAD to be repainted.\n- When we confronted the managers about the status of several items of dismay, we were given a blanket answer of \u201cNormal wear and tear\u201d. Had the managers competed proper exit walkthroughs I am certain tenants would have been responsible for the majority of repairs and damages. Instead we were left with most of them.\n\nSuggestion, use Becky Hancock if you are local and have the ability to conduct your own spot checks or enforce the terms of your agreement.

If you're going to rent in this town, make sure you take photographs of every wall, floor and ceiling.  Take videos of the appliances working.  And be very thorough when conducting and filling out your move-in section reports, document every knick, scratch, and imperfection, because when you move out, they will charge you for damages and keep your security deposit regardless of whether or not you caused them.  And they realize you've moved to a different state or country and are powerless to recoup it.  Now, dealing with this agency has been a headache.  I moved out, and was charged for damages that were documented when I moved in, and their justification does not coincide with the receipts from the repair companies.

They offer what they call an easy checkout process, where a tenant can hire an approved cleaning company instead of cleaning the house themselves. The cost for the cleaning company ($300) comes out of the security deposit. Here's a quote from the check out form: \"Simply hire one of our\nrecommended cleaning services and you are done, assuming there are no major damages to the property.\" I used this easy check out process, but when I finally got my deposit back from them (over a month after I checked out), they had taken out an additional $280 for additional cleaning services on top of the approved company I hired. They also took money out to pay for lawn care service, and paid for service from the same company that I had paid for every month for two years (including the month I checked out). The were no deductions for damages, so I don't understand why these additional cleaning fees were not part of the easy checkout program that was supposed to be all inclusive. Bottom line, they will take more money from you than they say they will, which makes them undeserving of their tenants' trust. They get away with it because the vast majority of their tenants are military, and when those tenants move it's often across the country or overseas and it's very difficult for the service members to negotiate with this company to get their money back from so far away.

They said that the door would be replaced and the carpet cleaned and bleached within the week, it was a Tuesday.

I understand that sometimes things take a while to organize logistically, but at least call the tenant and let them know what is going on with the maintenance. Especially when they have mold growing in their carpet. We lived in the property for one year and the manager was changed twice, without us ever being notified. We had some issues with the siding in December and called them about it. We never heard back about what they were doing to fix it so we called back in around February. The former manager had left the company and never passed the information along to the new manager. The new manager said they would get it done right away, and fix the microwave that had just gone out. The microwave was fixed within a few days, but they never did anything about the siding other than come and get an estimate. We called back around a month later and they said that the job had been closed, even though nobody had fixed a thing. After multiple calls and switching to yet another property manager, the siding was replaced about three weeks before we moved out in August.

I understand that it was my wife and I's fault that we didn't write all of the individual discrepancies down or take a picture, but when we moved out, they charged us to repaint two rooms, the hallway, and the entire inside of the garage.

I'm military and I bought a house from Butch Wright from Re/Max when I PCS'd he I elected for his company to be my property. Everything was great until he retires and Becky Hancock realty bought him out. That is when everything went down hill. 1st off their ability to call you back is non-existant, Belinda is the absolute worst property manager maybe on Earth. She doesn't know how to speak intelligently on the status of your property. She also is terrible at doing move out inspections. Here is why. I had multiple tenants while under Belinda's keen eye. After I closed out my account the fridge was missing trim, my lawn mower was gone and some how she doesn't have any record of it. There were holes in the walls that cost way more then $150 to fix but only charged the tenants $150. Someone had a cat and when I walked in it smelled aweful. Carpet I never was reimbursed for mismatched and appeared to be pieces together. Like a tenant stained or ripped it and put a patch bandaid on it. They lost the two garage door openers that I had with the house. They gave me to two in return but neither of them work. They didn't checked the backyard at all. There are places along the fence where dogs dug and tenets filled it in with random metal pieces and rocks.  Those are just problems with Belinda. Now for the actual company. Their bookkeeping is horrible. And the owner statements I receive do not match or add up to the completely different system the book keeper uses. I found this it at move out when somehow a vacant house used $700 in four months paying only water and electric bills. I strongly suggest never ever working with this company. Lastly managers are non existent I asked to speak with a manager every time Belinda did not call me back. Yet I spoke to them 1 time in multiple years. And I heard they are bad at selling houses as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926fa7d513399d:0xd479345346f6500b"}

I've lived in three of Bradford's properties over the last 10 years and have only positive things to say about them.  They're open Monday-Friday 9-5, just like their website says they are.  I will say that I've called within those hours and had to leave a message before but they've always called me back.  They have an email address for emergency maintenance which they've always been responsive to as far as I am concerned at least.  The people who work there are always polite and helpful.  I've had issues with bugs in the past as well but they sent an exterminator over for an extra spray a couple of times between the regular monthly spray and the issue was taken care of.  The guys who do their maintenance seem very nice.  They've surely never been rude or disrespectful.  I've had a couple of situations where they came to fix something and didn't have all of the parts the needed, so they had to leave and come back- once even hey had to order a part and it didn't come until the next day, but they seem to be qualified and have always made repairs that meet my standards.   I've surely never been made to feel as if they don't care about me or my issues.  I see them at least once per month to pay rents. I always have a delightful conversation with Jenny who works the front desk.  She is always kind to ask about my family and my life.  This business is very community oriented and involved in most every event that goes on in Montevallo.  I always see that they've sponsored little league and parades and festival and food drives.  I just can't imagine anything than that the people who have left negative comments created negative situations for themselves.  I'd even go so far as to say that this company goes above and beyond for their tenants.  Josh even came by to check on my heater one year on thanksgiving night because it had been giving me some issues that week.  anyone that is going to come out after hours and on a holiday just to make sure my family and I aren't cold is ok by me.  I'd give these people 10 stars if it was an option.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892bb498c626b1:0x6191003fd3ca9e4d"}

When I initially asked the front desk clerk if it would be okay to pay my 1st months rent,  and since I was there, give her a check for the upcoming months rent. I don't live in Montevallo and the property I was renting was in Alabaster. So since you can't pay rent online, I gave the post dated check so that I wouldn't have to drive back to Montevallo. I was assured TWICE by the clerk that this was okay. Fast forward after I paid my initial deposit as well as first month's rent. They decided to also deposit my post dated check for the upcoming month. Leaving me with an NSF due to the fact that the postdated amount wasn't accounted for in my monthly budget. ESPECIALLY after you already received $2,000 from me within a weeks time. I called and spoke with JOSH who verbally assaulted me and basically called me a criminal for writing bad checks. After he informed me that it's not their policy to take a post dated check and he doesn't know where I got that info from. I LITERALLY GOT IT FROM THE FRONT DESK  CLERK!!!! HE took no ownership, did not apologize, complained about a $50 fee he would have to pay b/c of my returned check and then hung up in my face. The crazy thing about this whole situation is that the check cleared on my end. My bank LITERALLY cleared the check and just charged me an NSF fee. All I wanted was my $30 back. He didn't even have the human decency to listen to what I was telling him before becoming beligerent!! This company is the absolute worst that I have ever dealt with in my life.

Now if you're renting a trailer you're obviously going to have to pay more than I did and also I'm sure the prices has went up considering they were bought out so the same people that own the part when I live there or not there anymore there are not near as many speed bumps as there are in the park I Live Now basically the park I Live Now has coming in and going out 40 speed bumps you have to go over and Cahaba mobile home real estate does not have near that many as in any trailer park the best advice I can give you is just to stay to yourself or if you're lucky you will are could meet a few good neighbors the park I am in now it's mostly at least  spent 80% of the Hispanics community. And when I left Cahaba mobile home real estate it was about half and half half Hispanic community in the other half Caucasian community.

Rentmonster was an absolute life saver trying to find an apartment around town.\n\nI was initially staying in an extended stay hotel trying to find a place, doing hours of research every night, and because of my work schedule I couldn't tour many places due to their limited office hours. I heard about Rentmonster and it just made sense. They have a ton of connections with apartments around town, a huge list of potential properties, and best of all: it was free. I had an all the benefits of an expensive broker without paying a dime.\n\nMy particular agent, Jessi, went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me out. With my work schedule we couldn't do much during the week - she worked with my schedule and met me on a few Saturdays/Sundays when she normally wouldn't be working. Jessi was very easy going, professional, insanely knowledgeable about the properties and apartments in the area, and the whole staff made me feel at home from the moment I walked into their offices. Jessi worked with me over the course of a week or two, whittling down the places I did and didn't like, and eventually found  a place that I ABSOLUTELY love - which is surprising considering how picky I was. Throughout the whole process, Jessi was very patient working with me to find exactly what I wanted.\n\nKudos to Jessi, and the rest of the Rentmonster staff. Over the course of my apartment search I spent a fair amount of time in their offices, and they were all very welcoming and wonderful, one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had.

I also think some of the shortcomings of the leasing office have to do what the small size of the staff and the large number of properties that they have to communicate with.

They have sent out 4 of their mainstreet techs to look at the dryer outlet, every single one says we need an electrician. They say they'll put an order in for one to come out and they never do. I call again and it's been the same process EVERYTIME. I even contacted the email below and he said he would put an order in after the last guy did the same thing. Yet again they scheduled it to the same tech that was here last time.\n\nDeck finally got fixed after multiple calls and emails. They didn't even use the weather treated wood, good luck to the next few renters who will go through the same thing in the next 5 years.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SANITY PLEASE GO ELSEWHERE. I've called their service center at least 30 times over a 4 to 5 month span, all regarding maintenance. Most of their call center people are clueless.\n\nUpdate: It's been 4 months, deck still isn't replaced. I had nothing but issues regarding people coming out to the house to fix varies things. Some of the vendors are great, other barely ever will call you back. Our outlet for our dryer has been shorting out for 3 months now and nothing has been done about. I often have to call at least 3 times before anyone will come out to the house. I emailed the email provided below, about 2 weeks ago, haven't heard anything back. The mountain of issues with this house keeps growing and I honestly regret going with this company. I counted the other day and I've called their maintenance center over 25 times in 4 months!\n\nI love the neighborhood and size of our new place, except our moving in experience has been unpleasant. My partner and haven't been in our place for a month and it's been problem after problem.\n\nThe place was suppose to be inspected before we moved in and considering the plumbing inspector arrived a couple days after we moved, it's apparent this didn't happen. He said there was work that needed to be done. Never heard anything after that, until I reported a leaking pipe a couple days ago (the inspector came out almost 2 weeks ago). The downstairs reeks of mildew and the garage also has a leak ( the ceiling tiles in the garage around the leak have mold so it's easy to see there's a leak).\n\nThe lawn hadn't been mowed in 3 months according to the neighbors and it appears to be true.\n\nThe deck is completely rotted and my fiance already fell through once. This problem has been addressed and can't completely blame them for it going unnoticed since it on the side of the house and not directly connected to the back door.\n\nThen today tops it all, the gutters haven't been cleaned in forever so now the backdoor is flooding the back room because the gutter is emptying right in front of the door.\n\nThe application process and our agent that we dealt with was great, but it's obvious there was a lot left undone before we moved in.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603906045173, "text": "Hi Kenzie,\r\rThank you for taking the time to update your review.

I even took off half a day so that I can make this appointment as if you're late to the appointment you would be charged a late fee . I went to check out the home and waited almost 15 minutes for the lady to come . We viewed the home but she kept trying to tell me about another property , etc etc. Before we left she asked if I could follow her to another house that I may like better which was about 10min away. I didn't like the home at all but I remember the agent telling me that they had more homes in the Hueytown area . The agent quickly text me an application but I continued to look . After finding a house in Midfield on there website that wasn't ready for viewing yet my brother and I applied for the home bc it was nice from the photos and I had stopped by to check it out myself . Paid the $80 sent in all my information and was  contacted my Robert Bickerton who told me and my brother how he needed to fill in his portion of the application and uplod his documents. Well the  link he sent wasn't working and I tried to explain that to him and all he emailed me back \"please see the email I sent earlier\" I then had to call in and speak with someone else and explain and they reset the link for me .  I saw where my credit had been checked and I said ok maybe they are moving along with the application process . I get a email the next day stating that we had been denied but he couldn't give me a specific reason but did say\" it 's probably your rental history and  Rentgrow will be in contact with you on a couple of days to tell you why you were denied  \" I contacted my landlord whom I have been renting from for 10 years and asked her had they called bc she is expecting them to reach and she said no one ever called her for my rental history . I even emailed ROBERT back to ask him  what he meant about rental history so I can tell him no one ever checked mine in the first place. He never responded back nor said anything else that may help is else  to get  into that home or another home .\n\nLong story short  I didn't appreciate the way that things were handled and I felt as though I paid $80 for them to run one thing and that was it .\n\nI'm so glad that we found another home with another rental company and had proof that they did employment verification as well as rental history verification . We will be moving into that home at the end of the month .\nSo it you're on the search please consider other companies before giving them your money .", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589469898668, "text": "Hi Shannon,  I appreciate you taking the time to leave us a review.

I live in Birmingham, Al and there was a property I viewed through Rently ,  when I viewed the property, it was still open and had not been applied for . This past Sunday on 2/2/2020 I decided to apply for the property and pay my application fee. After Applying, I wake up Monday morning to call and check on the property I was told by the Homewood Al office I would receive a call back in 20 minutes, never heard anything back. I get up Tuesday morning 2/3/2019 to go and visit Msrenewal, and check on it one of the property managers introduced himself, got my info and told me that he would check on my application, he later returned 5 minutes later stating that I had needed a guarantee for the house( A Bs excuse) . I\u2019ve been renting since I was 19 years old and I am now 25, never had a broken lease and I\u2019ve also never had an eviction nor late payment, furthermore I\u2019ve never had a problem getting approved for anything, especially when you make the income .This would be my second house. However, I got in my vehicle and decided to check their website and the home was no longer available. I am not a genius but it doesn\u2019t take a rocket science to see that someone was able to apply and secure the home before me, that isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is the excuse I was given and the fact that they left the house available for people to still apply for knowing that they already had potential candidates ready to secure the home , and also the fact that they basically took my hard earned money when simply they could have reached out to me, and explained the situation, and offered for me to apply for another property with the app fee money !

I have had minimal maintenance needs (2 or 3) and they have taken care of them almost as soon as I contacted them. I can also say that I have had only positive experiences/interactions with the staff in the office as well. It is always easier to post a negative review rather than a positive.

Their front office is terribly slow to response to emails and most of the property are owned by out of state owner/offices so you can never talk directly to anyone you need to. The maintenance service is extremely slow and redundant.  To put in a ticket you must explain the problem in detail, then you wait 2-5 days for a main street employee to come look at the problem you explained in detail. For the maintenance guy to tell you, yes that is the problem. Then MainStreet will call a contractor to fix the problem but you will have to wait for the contractors to schedule an appointment (3-10 days later). Then the contractor shows up and looks at the problem you have already explained twice, to tell you yes that is the problem.

I have only been here a few months and have had a negative experience from the start. The property that i am renting has had plumbing, electrical, and structure problems since the first day i moved in. These were problems that i was not able to see until AFTER i paid my deposit and rent and had my utilities turned on. After many calls and complaints to get these problems fixed, it took over a month to get someone to come address the problems. WHAT PROBLEMS? You ask? Well there were outlets throughout the house that weren\u2019t functioning. When the maintenance guy came out to work on it, he told me that the whole house was improperly wired. So i could not use half of the electrical outlets in the house for over a month. Extension cords and surge protectors became my friends for that period of time. Next, there were leaks from the kitchen sink, from plumbing between the first and second level of the house, from the HVAC system. Water was literally pouring from those places and the company did not seem concerned with sending anyone to fix those problems until i called the health department to inspect the property. Oh yes i have videos and pictures of all of this\u2014- even the mold and collapsed ceiling due to plumbing/ water leaks. And still months after the FIRST call about the plumbing i still have water pouring from the first floor into the finished basement area. None of these problems were apartment until i was already locked into a lease and the company is unwilling to allow me to break the lease nor properly maintain the property! And the list goes in and on about problems... yes and i have copies of all the maintenance requests as well... date and time stamped as proof of this company\u2019s negligence and fraud. And last but certainly not least... this company has put charges on my account for late payment... and when i call to resolve the issue... they put me off by saying someone will get back with me on the issue or try and give some BS excuse for the charges to be on he account. YET AGAIN, i have bank statements showing the dates that payments were made and none of her were late. In fact, my rent payments have been made the month BEFORE they are due. This review is not a joke. I should have read the reviews before renting from this company. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!!!

Things happen but I have always paid no return checks on my account or anything. At one point I was ahead on my rental by 1 month. So tried to pay my rent on 1/27 for Jan. Not even 30 days past due yet... I am unable to unless I pay by certified funds. Where? I don't even know where the office is located...again I didn't rent from them. Why? If I have never had a return payment on my account? Also added a eviction filling fee on the account for $700 Really? So your tenants can't come up on hard times? The point is the rent was due Jan and I was willing to pay for it in Jan but now I'm threaten with a eviction and a $700 charge. The rental company I signed a lease with has no mentioning of eviction before 30 days or filing fee in the lease though. All they have to say is that this is vaild and to please pay.

Our lease was over 3/2/19. We confirmed this with the company office via email and mail and even did the walkthrough with a local inspector that I had to take time off of work to meet who said the place looks great and thanked us for having it professionally cleaned. We then receive a bill for the month of March with a late fee and have been sent to collections as our local office had no idea that we had submitted our intent to move or even that we had done our walkthrough. Even though we have kept the same renters insurance the entire two years that we have been in our house, they are trying to charge us for two months of not being compliant with renters insurance! The only call we've gotten back from anyone has been from a collections agency. Someone call us back please!!!\nOur two years have been awful. The house was put together horribly with stair rails coming off, sinks coming off the walls, plumbing literally put together with duct tape and each time the repairman says it's a common theme.\nWe initially got our house because it was a neighborhood with a pool which we requested from them specifically. However as this company never pays the HOAs we never got to use the pool. When I asked about it from the local office I am basically told that there's nothing they can do. Pools are not necessary even though my rent us supposed to include the HOA fees.\nI'm very frustrated right now.

The weekend past and I noticed that my application was canceled and when I called back, I spoke with someone named Tiffany, who claims that she worked closely with Rebecca. She stated that they had to reapply me and my aunt and call me back later. I later received a call from Rebecca telling me that I was denied by her because my check stub looks fake. First I would say that I am a nurse/ csr and no one at the office had contacted my job or my aunts job. They went on to say that the companies wasn't coming up in her computer. I then asked her to call the jobs and she stated that she had made her decision and that was all she could do. I then asked to speak to a manager and she told me that she was the highest authority in the building. I asked for the corporate number and she told me to Google it. This was very unprofessional of this company. She actually said that corporate gave her the authority to do what she does. Everytime I called, she would say rude things. After waiting about an hour and calling back, Tiffany verified that there were actually 5 mangers in the office and that she lied to me. This company has got to be better. I felt discriminated against because my manager also went through this company and stubs are identical. I am going to get my lawyer in on this and he will be contacting this company.

I put a maintenance request in regarding plumbling/leak issues on 11/3/17.  No one never came out.  I put another request in fo r the same problem on 11/13/17.  No one never came.  A couple of days ago I received my water bill.  It was $383 For one month.   My bill is mormally $135.  I immediately put in another maintenance request and called them the next morning since about all my maintenance request for the same issue that had never been addressed.  They put me on hold and came back and said they contact the plumbing company,who was assigned and the would be contacting me to come out.  I still never received call.  I called back the next day and got someone different and the said the would do a new work and send it to a different plumbing company and I would be contacted within 4 hours.  Well I never got a call.  I also had the water company to come out and it's nothing on their end.  They informed me that it was nothing on their end they would be reading the meter again soon for the next bill and it looks like it going to be extremely high again.  I  called main street back this morning to let them know the 2nd plumber never contacted me.  They informed that that plumber service Georgia only.  After a extremely long hold the came back and stated that they had assigned yet another plumber and I will be contacted within a coup or of hours.  We will see how this goes.\n\nUpdate :\n6/20/18\nMain street took over the property I've been renting back in November 2017.  My lease was expiring on 3/31/18.  I receive a notice in December stating I needed to either give them 30 days notice that I would be vacating at end of lease or I need to contact them about applying for a new lease with them and my rent would go from $875 to $1,050.  I began contacting them in January 2018 regarding a new lease because I decided we would stay another year\nI never got a response.  I called and was told leasing team was in a meeting and they would call me back.  They didn't.  I sent another email I'm January, February and March.  Never got a response.  They still continued to bill me for the same $875 after March.  I have always paid rent on time.  I received a letter on June 14, 2018 that was dated June 8, 2018.  They letter stated that my lease ended on 3/31/18 and they would not renew and I had to be out by July 9, 2018, less than 30 days.  I immediately called.  They stated that the owner had decided that they didn't want to rent anymore and wanted to renovate and sale.  I explained I know they have that right but less than 30 days was not enough time to find a new home nor apartment and have funds for security deposit, 1st months rent and other moving related expensive.  I asked if they could give more time they said what the owner said goes and they couldn't do anything about it.  As I go back and look at the notice I received when Main street took over.  It names Main street as the owner not anybody else. This has really put my family and I in a bad position, I have a newborn grandson and a disabled finace and still haven't found somewhere to go as well as the money we will need to move.

I have a call into the owner and hope to better understand how their business operates. My biggest frustration is items that were not addressed when we moved in as well as items that we found shortly after that are not correct. A simple example of 1 item (keep in mind there are several) is an entry door handle that was installed backwards. My door can be opened from the outside because it\u2019s on backwards. I have pictures. The company agrees it is on wrong but since it\u2019s easy to fix it is my responsibility. The lease agreement is set to basically remove them from doing anything at all unless the roof is falling in. A rental from them is pretty much like being a home owner and not a renter. I have rented and owned so I understand normal maintenance. It\u2019s crazy to think as a rented you have to install a door handle correctly from installation errors. As a renter with Alabama Rental Managers you are responsible to clean up the \u201cblack mildew\u201d on the sheet rock 1 week after you move in. I am using the word \u201cblack mildew\u201d as requested by the Director of Service. He asked me to use that word specifically in place of any other word.\nCrazy to think as a renter your unit will have a pink polkadot on the carpet the size of a basketball. Crazy to be told that the carpet stain would be removed and if it didn\u2019t come out it would be replaced prior to move in. Crazy to think we would spend WEEKS without AC in the unit only 6 weeks after moving in. Crazy to think I would be told to crawl into the attic and locate the AC unit and check several components prior to dispatching a technician out on site. Even crazier to think after 3 service visits the AC unit still did not work but luckily by this time it was fall and not needed. Just all in all I am surprised the service is so poor. Be sure to read the contract very closely as I have found the renter will pay for a lot more than I think they should.\n\nI will add that I have pictures and time stamps of my displeasure. I will also say read their reviews to hear what others are saying. 3 star rating is what they have and someone else mentioned they have bad reviews removed. Not sure there.\n\nAll in all if you want to rent a property but pay as the owner it\u2019s a great rental company. They expect you to come out of pocket for everything before they even know what\u2019s wrong. I can attest to that. I also forgot to mention the AC unit when it was inspected was said to never have had a service. The technician was a third party and we found debris in the drain pan from the install. There were wore strands, wire nuts, insulation, instructions, ETC in the pan. The technician said if the unit was ever serviced the technician servicing would have been expected to clean that. I asked for a copy of previous service history on the AC unit and they would not provide it. I let it go when they finally agreed to cover the cost. Yes that\u2019s right. They wanted me to pay to have the AC unit serviced 2 months after I moved in. Lol. Lots of pictures to share with anyone at ARM who would like to talk and review. Thanks.\n\nI almost forgot that we asked for all the animal hair to be removed the day we moved in. The same day. Once we finally heard back from them a week later we were told it was our responsibility and do we have a pet. So funny. But no we do not have a pet. Either way we did clean the unit. Whoever moved out before we moved in should get the cleaning fee back. I have pictures of the unit not cleaned either. They offered to send someone if we wanted but this was weeks after we were in the unit. We had to clean it ourselves. I asked if I could get a cleaning credit when we moved out and you know the answer... no. I guess it is a GREAT business model. They charge you to clean it for the next person but then make the next person do the cleaning. I bet 99% of the time they get away with it.

All I will say is, if you are a tenant, it is best you read and FULLY COMPREHEND their lease and policies BEFORE YOU SIGN and commit. They follow the lease too the very fine lines and will use that to justify any action you may violate. A lease is a contract, and if you think this company will not follow their own document, than you may need to just keep shopping around. From our experience, as long as you pay on time and do what is required, than they pretty much leave you alone. Maintenance issues are up to the Owner and the company only acts as the middleman to handle issues, so don't really feel mad if they don't fix something for your rental (we never had that problem because they fixed all of our issues); you should feel mad at the owner for making the decision to not fix an issue. We fixed things ourselves mostly to avoid the hassle of begging and waiting, but when we requested help to repair an issue, they were right there to take care of it as soon as the owner gave his approval. If I could do it all over again, I think I would have rented an apartment just to avoid all of the extra costs we had to spend for the lawn care, minor maintenance issues, pest control, and cleaning the gutters. However, I would say this, treat it as a business and do your part as a tenant. Any rental house will require the tenant to do more than they would for an apartment. There are not perfect rentals! WE just made sure our calls were pleasant, we followed the lease line by line, and made sure we had the money to handle extra costs to keep up the rental, and we walked away with our sanity.

I see a lot of 1 star reviews and ranting but please allow me to be unbiased. Every homeowner is not a slum lord. Tenants need to understand that they have responsibilities also. If a tenant does not read the contract properly with understanding then unnecessary stress is coming; lawn care is the is one of those things. I cannot speak for other homeowners but if a tenant does not want to provide lawn care then it can be negotiated to be included in the rent. Problem solved. Yes, there is a bit of frustration with ARM not having an in-house maintenance team and yes they do their best to keep homeowners in the loop concerning such things. The company is not corporate. Sometimes I even thought of getting a company that has an in-house team, however, the costs will raise rent. Nothing is free or perfect. This is a growing small business. A tenant cannot determine the type of homeowner he/she will get and neither can a homeowner determine the type of tenant they will get; I have had a tenant from hell that had the perfect application as well as the mature and great tenants I have now. If you have never worked with the public or in public service, please try it. It is extremely stressful dealing with all types of personalities and you do not know the mental state of each person; it can be difficult to discern. My point is respect others and do your best to maintain self control because you do not know if an ARM staff member just got insulted to the nth degree on a previous call by someone who was taking their frustrations out on the staff, or if the ARM staff is trying to resolve the problem for the tenant but a homeowner is being difficult and cheap. Could ARM restructure some things, yes however the cost could be greater for everyone. Everyone desires more for less these days and it is difficult to find the ideal balance sometimes.

When I put my deposit down I mentioned an odor or urine near a downstairs bathroom. When I moved in they had done nothing. Told me it was because the house was vacant for so long and the sewer gas was coming up. This is not true. I found out that they knew about the pet urine and chose not to replace the carpet.\n\nWhen I moved in they kept the house at 55 degrees. When I turned on the heat it activated the urine smell. I told them about it immediately. That was three weeks ago. I can\u2019t even eat in my own home because the smell is so bad. The carpet guys came out to replace carpet today. When they pulled it up they found urine stains all into the living room. They immediately called ARM as did I.  ARM claimed that the stains are not urine in the living room. Not true. You can see the pictures. ARM is having them put the urine stained carpet back on my floor. You can see pics of what they are putting back on my floor. The smell is unimaginable. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m living like this. Jordan in maintenance hung up on me. Maintenance claims it\u2019s a quality control issue and I can\u2019t get quality control to call me back.

The last month of our lease our water was turned off without our knowledge or consent (water is provided with the unit/paid along with the rent on the portal). The payments manager Krispin Watson was made aware that we were not going to pay rent for a unit where provided utilities were turned off. She didn't seem to care, and we were still charged a late fee\u2026for a unit where a necessary utility was turned off for no good reason. She later insinuated that we were being lazy and causing issues for no reason because we wanted someone from maintenance to finish turning the water on at the unit, and she would charge us $100 if we didn't finish it ourselves. Later someone else let me know that our situation did not constitute that charge, so watch out. Robbe Gay was great and thankfully made it right for us, which was all we asked after the list of issues we experienced. For 6 months of our lease they showed our unit to prospective buyers, so half the year we were emailed and texted frequently to let in viewers/inspectors and to step outside. Our ceiling leaked in rain twice, for well over a week both times, and we had to threaten to break lease before they finally urged the owner to fix it. One of our vents was not hooked up to anything, and cold winter air could be felt instead of heat (our bill was outrageous). They told us to change our air filter to \u201cfix it\u201d. We had to send them a photo from an inspector before they believed us and fixed it. We got many emails the first month or so threatening our utilities, mainly to put our water in our name (which we couldn\u2019t do because per our signed lease it was to stay in the owners name) and that if we didn\u2019t pay our electricity bill they would turn it off (had to send them 3 pieces of mail showing it was in OUR name and WE handle that).

For several months, our dumpster was never taken care of. We had trash overflowing despite a number of calls from several residents in our building.

I called, emailed, and corresponded with the \"director of quality control\" Mindy, throughout this entire time. She blamed it on HOA and never offered to hire a private service to take care of it. Our yard looked abandoned and it led to a flea infestation due to the excessive overgrowth. My dog would get swallowed every time he went outside to use the bathroom. Eventually the yard was taken care of (two months after I initially complained/informed them of the neglect), Mindy claims a private lawn service took care of the yard, but it was actually the owners of the building next to our unit who took care of it themselves. Again, no compensation was offered to the residents for this inconvenience. I am now being charged an additional $250 for a vendor coming out and checking our air conditioning because he \"didn't find any problems with the HVAC.\" The vendor told us that the unit was poorly constructed and we would have to suffer with the heat, but he did unclog a pipe and refill our anti freeze, yet we are still being charged because he found no issues with the unit (although he did address two problems: lack of antifreeze and a clogged pipe). Despite numerous efforts to reach out to supervisors, directors, and even the owner of the entire rental company, no one has offered clarity or compensation for the ridiculousness that we have had to deal with at our time with this company. My roommate and I are both students who work full time to pay our rent and other bills and the fact that the employees of ARM have been completely unwilling to work with us or offer us explanation for a myriad of problems we have tried to address is beyond frustrating. I am writing this review to warn others not to get locked into an agreement with this company and also to maybe get a response from ARM since regular attempts at correspondence have led me nowhere. This review has also left out the attitudes we have dealt with when communicating with several of the employees of the this company when getting our lease signed/renewed and general questions we have had in regards to the property.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923adbfd88cd5:0x39eb72ea1fa7e254"}

Per the lease agreement, if residents have given their notice to vacate and the house is being advertised, showings are scheduled with a 48-hour notification. This is a typical procedure for showing homes whether for sale, or for rent. With single-family housing, any damage that occurs after a resident takes possession, as indicated in your review, is normally tenant responsibility. We would love to talk with you further to go over your experience. Someone from our team will reach out, and provide documentation for your convenience.\n\nSincerely,\n\nOur Team"}, "gmap_id": "0x888923adbfd88cd5:0x39eb72ea1fa7e254"}

Customer service is totally a lost concept with this organization. Their only concern is getting your money and nothing else.\n\nIf you have a maintenance issue you can be rest assured you won't hear from them. My first year my refrigerator went out and numerous calls (more than 10) were made to their maintenance department and ONLY because a desperate call to the homeowner resulted in getting the problem fixed (this was AFTER 30 DAYS of waiting). Of course all food/milk was spoiled! This was just the beginning of maintenance problems that never got resolved until direct calls to the owner were made. The accounting department is just as bad. We're still owed nearly $500 after having to wait 60+ days after moving out.\n\nI personally own 2 homes and would NEVER hire ARM to handle my affairs. You're better off just managing your OWN property if you want to keep your tenants happy and willing to renew their contract with you year after year.\n\nUpdate from response:\n\nI only stayed the 5 years time due to cost (moving & reorganization). The inconveniences during that time I had to bear. Again, direct calls to the owner were the only reasons we got anything fixed. It certainly wasn't because of your maintenance department which had failed in spades.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1505930250974, "text": "We are truly very sorry you feel that our customer service is lost and were quite surprised to read this review as you stayed with us for 5 years.

Each time the home owner was made aware and they only authorized repairs which were completed each time.  Unfortunately, ARM cannot authorize replacements without the home owner approving the cost for their home.  I do not see a work order that took 30 days to complete.  The last work order for the fridge was in October of 2013 and took 10 days to complete.  I only see 4 other maintenance items during the last 4 years of your stay with ARM.\n\nWe mailed you a full refund for your deposit within the 60 day time period required by the Alabama Landlord Tenant Law.

I have rented different properties for over 6 years and I have never had a late payment. They were the first company that made me feel the need to never lease again. The lease for a house that I had recently rented through them for two years was not renewed. The owner wished to sell the house but still wanted tenants. I settled on a month to month lease and Alabama rental managers made this a terrible experience. The owner eventually asked for the month to month lease to be terminated due to the fact that the house was not selling. My roommates and I moved out at the end of the month even though there was never a date given to us in the \"official\" termination letter by the company. After we moved out a prorated rate for days/weeks in the following month were charged to my account. The company not only knew we moved out at the end of the month but they also inspected the house on that date. They spent three months to give us our security deposit back and it had all of these charges attached to it. Meanwhile they are impossible to get a hold of and anyone you do talk to doesn't have any answers.

This rental company and the employees I dealt with are pathetic. This is the most unprofessional disorganized company. I found a rental I liked but when I went out to look at the property alone to make sure it looked good it was nothing like what they had pictured on their site. So I decided to call and discuss this issue. Well, when I called I spoke to a Kristy or Krista something like that who is absolutely worthless. I assume she's new bc she couldn't answer simple questions and got extremely rude and aggressive when I called her out on it. I will be calling the owner of this company and informing then how I was treated when I called to inquire about rental properties. The girl lacks class and needs a serious course in customer service. Who runs this circus??? What a joke. Now as I read threw the reviews I see exactly what kind of people run this company. Whoever replies to the reviews needs to be fired immediately. What kind of business owner/employees tries so hard to make the reviewer look bad and claim they are innocent. I wouldn't rent from this company after everything I've seen, heard and  read. It's obvious the problem is with the company not the renters. I hope they realize how bad they make themselves look by the responses they give. They respond like immature kids who have gotten their feelings hurt. Someone needs to come in and train these people. I've owned a business for 30 years and if I had employees like the one that answered the phone she would be fired immediately as well as whoever replies to the reviews. They are the reason this company is getting such a bad name. There is a certain way you deal with people when you work at a business like this and the way they handle things is pathetic. This company obviously cares nothing about it's reputation. If they did the would've gotten rid of the ones that most of the reviews are about. I see a increase in good reviews which it's obvious to anyone what's going on there. Its almost laughable how awful this company handles business. I've read thru the reviews and some of these people should've sued this company. I will personally be reporting this company. This is no way to do business. They lie about the condition of their properties. They obviously don't hold up their end of the lease agreement either. To the girl who had the neighbor who kept threatening them. Take the police reports to an attorney along with picture's, you have a viable lawsuit.

I told the owner of the property I am renting if he did not change property managers I would be moving.  You can never get anyone on the phone.  I have had several maintenance issues while renting from them and I have had to spend more time getting things fixed than I should have.  The owner uses a home warranty company that requires a $75.00 fee every time they come out that I have had to pay every time.  They are suppose to call the company and give them their credit card # before they even come to my house.  They have reimbursed me each time but, the renter should NOT have to pay this.  They don't know if I have the $75.00 to pay or not and you can't get anyone on the phone to talk to the maintenance company either.  I went 2 1/2 months without a working shower and TUB.  Our family had to go and take a shower at my parents for a couple of weeks because the one working shower  broke also.  There is no follow-up from the office after having maintenance issues.  The office staff is rude and won't return phone calls or e-mails.  I went to the office and demanded to speak to someone and was told the VP \"Jenni\" was on the phone and wouldn't be able to speak with me.  She sent out a QA person who has nothing to do with maintenance issues or even staff issues to talk to me .  I am not sure what the property owner pays them for because they do not  do ANYTHING to help the renters.

As I mentioned in my emails to you yesterday, please call or email me directly in the future if you have any issues that are not being addressed immediately!  Unfortunately, sometimes it does take a little longer for maintenance items to be corrected when dealing with the Owner's Home Warranty Company.\n\nAs we also discussed, please do not ever pay out of your pocket for these service fees.  Someone is available in our office to pay these fees, even after office hours.  The vendors that are called out to the home through a Home Warranty call are not Alabama Rental Managers' vendors.  In the future, please just simply ask them to contact our office and we will take it from there!\n\nAs it pertains to not ever getting anyone on the phone, we have someone answering our calls from 8:30 am-5:00 pm Monday through Friday here in our office and an after hours service that answers all calls outside of business hours.  There should never be a time that you are not able to speak to someone when calling our office.  As you and I discussed, the day you came by our office, I had received your voicemail aprox. 45 minutes prior to your arrival and was on the phone with the Home Warranty Company for your rental home when you arrived.  One of my team members even met you at the front desk at my request to let you know I would be up to talk with you as soon as I was off the phone.  Unfortunately, you left the office prior to us being able to speak.\n\nAgain, please call or email me directly if I can ever be of assistance.

I contacted Alabama Rental Managers. Now if I had taken the time to check Google reviews and the Yelp reviews I wouldn't have even contacted them. As a business man myself I can tell you that just from reading some reviews and reading the way a employee responded to them that this is not a top notch, classy rental company. If I owned this business I would immediately fire whomever has responded to these reviews. Very unprofessional. Its obvious the person responding needs a course in Business 101. You don't respond to a  review by turning it around on the reviewer. You don't reveal things about their business dealings with your company. I would immediately fire the person responding or insist on them taking online classes in how to be a professional. From my first phone call to this buiness I saw red flags. The phone was answered by a female who was laughing as she answered the phone. I asked simple questions about several properties that she should've known the answers to. After the third Ummm......I'm not sure, I asked her to transfer me to someone who would know and she got very defensive and very rude saying to me, \"Sir, if you would just be patient and nice I would be able to find out answers to your questions but If your rude again, I will just hang up on you.\" I asked her why she didn't know the answers and her response was,\"Its not my job to know answers to those kind of questions.\" All I could say was, \"Wow.\" Honestly it was amusing. From the person responding to the reviews to the women who answers the phone this is one classless, trashy  business and so are those two employees. I finally asked her to please have an agent or someone with any knowledge about the business and properties to call me. I waited two days and no one ever called me. I can almost guarantee Miss Classless didn't even give anyone a message that a potiential renter wanted to speak to an agent  about a property. Probably because she knew I would inform them about the way she spoke to me. I wouldn't rent with this company now even if the house was perfect for my needs, nor will I reccomend this company to anyone. In fact I will strongly discourage it. I didn't make it past the front desk and I'm so glad I found out how unprofessional, disorganized and completely classless before I gave them my business. Some advice to the person responding to these reviews. Instead of sitting around reading and responding to reviews all day why don't you learn how to be a professional and an asset to this company because right now from what I can tell your far from an asset or a help to this company. Quite frankly your most likely causing more problems because you handle the disgruntled tenants and potential tenants the way you do. This company needs to get someone to come in and help this business and it's employees learn good customer service and how to act like professionals instead of acting like low class trash. Whoever responds to the reviews and answers your phone's cost you a renter and more potential renters by the way they act. Its a huge turn off and it's most likely costing you business, I know it did mine. Big mistake Alabama Rental Manager's, I could've sent you so much business. I'm a relocation specialist for a very large well known company. I help employees find rental homes to live in while they are working in this area.

I'm owed 3 months worth of late fees and I keep getting told, \"We sent a notice, and I will stay on top of it\".\nMaintenance concerns are always sent to me late. Recently repairs were made without authorization and I was told the money would be taken out of my rental income, I wasn't asked.

I'm not sure how much they charge per hour or if they used gold plated parts but looking up the parts they including in the sentence they typed for an invoice (not itemized) all parts would be less than $100. The bad thing is I was notified 5 days AFTER the repairs were completed and was told then that repairs needed to be done.\nThey are like \"mom and pop\" rental managers.

We are so glad to be out of the house we were renting with Alabama Rental Managers. We were without heat for an entire year, heat was still broken on the day we moved out. They can try to deny it all they want, but I have documentation of every single freezing cold day we spent in that house! We have a young child and a dog, let alone the fact that heat is the ONE thing they legally have to provide. These people are A holes!!! Jenny Moore (or Jennifer Rudeness, as we all like to call her) is an absolute horrible person, she is extremely rude and it's abundantly clear that she has no respect at all for due process. She needs to buy herself some training in customer service and train the rest of her staff as well, considering they probably developed their piss poor attitudes by watching her actions, or shall I say, \"lack thereof\"! I will even donate my entire deposit ONLY if they use it to train themselves in proper customer care, which I personally have been specializing in since I was 18. Otherwise, I fully expect an entire refund of my deposit as that house is now CLEANER than it was when we moved in. The grout was brown, now it's white thanks to me! If I could, I would give zero stars! We are a military family and we don't always get to choose where we move to, unfortunately we got very bad luck with this location and this horribly outrageous \"Management\" company. HOMEOWNERS BE WARE! THEY DO NOT DO QUARTERLY WALK THROUGHS AS THE CONTRACT YOU SIGN WITH THEM STATES! We lived there for over two years and they did ONE walk through 3 months before we moved out. They are liars on multiple levels. My family has been in real estate my entire life, I wouldn't trust these people with my clothes, let alone my house and if I was running that place, EVERYONE would be fired. They are breaking laws left and right and they only care about getting paid from both parties, renters as well as homeowners. This company will be extremely lucky if I decide to not waste my time reporting them to the BBB! I suggest you change your illegal ways, Alabama Rental Managers!\n\nIn response to your reply,\n\nNO! I will not waste my time calling you ever again. I will not waste my valuable time dealing with you ever again, no matter what. The only thing I might be doing is reporting you to the BBB as mentioned. You have SO many negative reviews dating back months and you still feel your customer service is at an acceptable level. You are blind! I feel it is a mistake to keep your customer service training in house, as I would currently give you a 2% rating out of 100% which clearly means your training techniques are NOT working. You choose to respond to reviews in a way that makes you look good. I have news for you, you are not good at your job whatsoever! And yes, we have been in your office multiple times, And dealt with people in person. AND FOR THE RECORD!!!! We only stopped reporting the heat issue because you REFUSED to handle it properly and I was about to rip my F-ing hair out. I have documented photos and videos of every single cold day we spent in that house. The fact that you chose to show publicly how many times we complained, actually helps my case 100% so thank you for that. I suggest you take my advice and hire someone for proper customer service and house management. It's simple, DO YOUR JOB OR QUIT, JENNIFER PS: if you would like to continue this \"debate\" about the grout, I will gladly show you the differenc in pictures!

If you don't like dealing with the public then find a new job instead of being so rude and making us feel like we are beneath you. What's really sad is her having to resort to asking FRIENDS to write a good review about her after a bad one. Very obvious too. The REAL tenants that have dealt with her horrible attitude write REAL reviews. If she treated people better then she wouldn't have SO many people mention her in their bad reviews about ARM. I also found out that Kristen lied to me about a rental being taken. I found out she lied because a friend of hers wanted it. I got my information from someone in the company and they were more then forth coming about this and about the \"friend reviews\".Maryann who answers the phone for maintenance, is rude too and acts like your bothering her when u call to report something she must be miserable on the inside to act so hateful when you call. What is up with this staff?? Most of them not all but most act like they hate there job and that they are better then the renters. Why I dont understand because I've seen this group. They have no reason to be cocky. If I owned this company I wouldn't dare continue to employe and pay people who are so rude. The president of this company needs to read these reviews as well as the ones on Yelp and other sites. This should tell you something, the neighborhood we lived in has 5 rental homes. Everyone moved out after one lease except for one family. One of the homeowners in that neighborhood is selling bc of the rentals. The price they charged us for rent you would think the house would've been built well and have nice floors and appliances instead of the cheapest linoleum, cheapest horrible carpet, cheapest appliances and crappy construction. If we hadn't needing something ASAP we would've continued to look. These homes are in Odenville off Kelly Creek and were built in 2015. One of the homes foundation was cracking and the roof was warped looking. When you move out, they make you do everything so they dont have to lift a finger. They even make you hire a professional carpet cleaner. Along with a check list of what your required to clean and the price if you don't. There is a picture of the list on Yelp. One little thing not done and they deduct it from your deposit and they will be extremely picky I assure you. They want to charge 75 dollars if the yard isn't cut but when you move in the yard looks like a jungle. Just read the reviews folks. When there are WAY more bad reviews then good, on numerous sites, then you know it's the truth. All of the bad reviews state almost the exact same issues. Almost all of the good reviews are from people who are just starting to rent with this company and the other good ones seem coheraced, almost like they asked these people to write a good review to off set the bad ones. Go read the Yelp reviews and the Gripeo review. ARM was great to us when we were moving in but just give it time and their true colors come thru. It doesn't take long AT ALL. This company has the worst reviews of any other company in the area and what I find funny is they comment back on  the bad reviews trying to discredit the person and argue the review. Extremely unprofessional. Its obvious they are saying anything in hopes of convincing the reader its not as bad as it truly is. I'm sure they will comment back on this review pointing the finger at me however my former neighbors know the truth about this company and so does alot of others. I'm sure there are some bad tenants but nowhere near as many as the bad reviews. The problem IS NOT the tenants, the problem is this company and the people who work for it. Save yourself money and distress. Rent with a company that cares about it's tenants and the quality of their rental homes.

If you owe a business, arent they supposed to send you a letter or written notice? They are so unprofessional because not only did I get ZERO letters, in the lease it stated I was to pay 45$ for late fee not 50$ so someone is not able to ensure things are consistent in this office anymore. I would not recommend dealing with this office whatsoever. They raised my rent and took three weeks to stop a huge rain water leak I had coming through my ceiling, and let me go without a working fridge for nearly a week while leaving two fridges in the tiny apartment for two weeks for storage not able to use either one. It has just been a ridiculous experience I am hoping there is a still a decent place to rent from in this area but so far this place has done me wrong totally I got two babies under 2.
