Brad put my mind at ease in the first few minutes of our consultation.  As painful as this process can be, Bond & Botes did everything in there power to keep me calm and on the straight and narrow path to financial freedom.  Their guidance and assistance in our case was the best that it could have been.  Pam also did an exceptional job keeping me up to date as our case progressed.  My wife and I are extremely excited to get this \"fresh\" start and would recommend Bond & Botes to anyone.  They provided outstanding customer service and professionalism, along with the ability to calm me down when my stress level was at it's peak.
