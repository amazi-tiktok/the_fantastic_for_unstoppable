I'm sure that you noticed, since you have been to our park multiple times, that we are not set up the same as Terminus. They are a much larger park with two full size systems that are capable of pulling 6-12 riders at a time, where we are a small operation with 2 two-tower systems that can only pull one rider at a time on each cable. With our current setup, weekends tend to be are busiest time, but I feel certain that if you were to visit our park early during the week when we are open 7 days a week, you will be able to achieve more ride time for the same amount of money since there wouldn't be as many people signed up.
