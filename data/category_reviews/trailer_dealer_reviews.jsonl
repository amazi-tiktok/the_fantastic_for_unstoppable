They were very nice and helpful and also apologized for the inconvenience. They (CM) located a local distributor for me to take my truck bed to for repair. This happened to be Jake's Trailers. The person at CM told me who to talk to and what to tell them to get my issue taken care of. So, I called Jake's trailers today and talked to the owner(or at least that's who he said he was) and explained my situation to him. His first question was, where did you buy it from and I told him a dealership in Tennessee. His response was, \"then you should take it back to the place where you bought it\". The place I bought the truck(with the bed already installed) was a car dealership, not a CM distributor was my response. You will have to work it out with them, not my problem.

During the covid trailer shortage due to supply chain problems, Stacey at Cargo Crush was the only vendor to even return an email and phone call. She was very helpful and knowledgeable and had a trailer on order that was exactly what I needed. I had many questions during the wait time for this trailer and she corresponded with me promptly even on the weekends. I found Cargo Crush to be very reliable, honest, selling only top brands of trailers at very competitive prices. The transaction couldn\u2019t have gone smoother despite the industry slowdown. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend Cargo Crush!\n\nBryan Baker", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e8ee5a4c669bb:0xb28684ac491b8df0"}

We have replaced an axle before without any problems. This one just would not fit no matter what we did. Eventually I measured the old axle compared with the new one and the new was 1.5 inches longer. Frustrated, we waited until the next business day to return the axle. Accidents happen with measuring so I wasn\u2019t terribly upset. When we arrived at Redneck trailers, we explained that the old axle was 1.5 inches smaller than the new axle. The same salesman questioned our ability to measure and measured it himself going out to our truck and measuring both axles. He agreed that they were different sizes but would not take the axle back and replace it. In fact, he did not even apologize and could not offer us any solution other than taking a torch to the axle and cutting off the U bolts and replacing them in the correct position and welding them ourselves. The only problem with this is that we had to do all that work ourselves, and the new axle will now sit 0.75 inches outside of the second axle on each side.

When looking at the different 5th wheel we had some questions and concerns, this is when things took a turn for the worst. The communication between the staff and owner leaves a lot to be desired, to the point that we were ready to walk away. After having a discussion with Mike (the owner) things were cleared up to our satisfaction and we decided to proceed with our cash purchase. It\u2019s been roughly a week since our purchase and we\u2019re currently hooked up at and RV resort. The black water tank was not clean, it was absolutely disgusting complete with maggots! We\u2019re still having an extremely difficult time getting it to drain much less empty. One of the gray tanks was completely full, the other was half full. The built in vacuum system is full, the \u201cstarter bucket\u201d had nothing that we could use. Our RV can accommodate a full size washer and dryer but we were told, \u201cwe don\u2019t have those.\u201d We went through with the washer/dryer combo install, being told that \u201cit\u2019ll work just as wet.\u201d It\u2019s just a pain and is far from working \u201cjust as well.\u201d We bought this particular 5th wheel because of it\u2019s construction and attic package.

( This was the only miscommunication between us and you because we had already agreed on a deal and you had even put deposit down.) I'm really confused why you would be complaining about the starter kit you got for free. As far as the washer and dryer combo we never told you a side by side would not fit we told you it was $900 more and you did not want to pay that much for one. As far as tanks not being clean/ full we explained to your husband the day you guys picked the camper up that you could not rely on the tank display gauges inside the camper. We took the camper to our dumpsite/ septic and showed him they were empty and even ran water and cleaner through all of them to satisfy you guys.
