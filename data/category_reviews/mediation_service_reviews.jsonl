She is organized, responsive, caring, and more importantly...she gets results! She listens and does her homework and cheers you along the way. Her paralegal Hannah is amazing as well...they tag team and get the job done! These ladies would even respond in the evening at times...well after hours if it was really important. She knows the key players in the court system which helps as well. I am so grateful to have met her. She is someone that you can tell your issue to once and she knows what you are thinking and how to fix it before you do. Nobody ever wants to go to court and I was a nervous wreck even though I was the one that filed. Kris was so compassionate, told me to relax...that she's got it and she was right. She will have your back! To achieve that level of trust that quickly when dealing with your family is priceless to me. I will forever be so grateful to have met her. Kris Sexton is definitely who you need to hire for custody issues, etc. Hopefully I will not need her again...but she offered to be on stand by if I needed anything else.

I had one hell of a battle with my ex wife over custody, visitation and of course,$$$. It took 2 years to reach a settlement(out of court) but she was on my side every step of the way. I had fallen into the deepest pit of depression and despair I'd ever been in, but she didnt allow me to roll over and just eat it. She called out the mind games that were being played by my ex.  she wouldn't allow me to get anything less than what I deserved nor be made to look like the bad parent I was accused of being. Thanks again for everything. You rock.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626bccbe9e042d:0x9efc150910bf9489"}

We chose Tim since he was  a member of our legal plan to represent us in a civil case. After telling us that the plan would not cover our case, we paid Tim a $2500 retainer. During this time Tim would be proactive and mail us copies of whatever documents he would send or file with the courts. I looked over our legal plan and found that his charges should have, in fact, been covered by our plan.Our legal plan's counse determined that this was so and advised Tim of the same. Since being notified that his time would be covered by the plan and  to not use my retainer for covered charges, I stopped getting any correspondence from his office. No copies of any documents,  no phone calls, no more updates, nothing. Tim never even told us that there was a hearing for summary judgement. The  only reason we found out was from a copy of the order from the  court, itself.  After the hearing, we found out that Tim didn't even argue our case as we had discussed. We eventually lost our case. Tim didn't even bother to notify us until over a week later. When asked about our options, Tim determined that he no longer wanted to represent us and referred us to another attorney who wouldn't even return our calls. When asked about the refund of the $2500 retainer, Tim put us off for over 6 weeks until he finally acknowledged he was trying to \"come up\" with the money. Our legal plan counsel had also been contacting him to return our retainer without further delay. Throughout this time and during our case Tim would never initiate contact with us. We had to initiate contact with him. Even then, it would take anywhere from a week and a half to a month before he would respond.  Tim eventually decided after 46 days that he was no longer going to refund our money despite knowing that his charges were covered by our plan. I have yet to get a breakdown of how my retainer was spent, much less anything else. I would never refer him to anyone. Now he is running for circuit court judge. If Tim is representative of our judicial and legal system, then we, as citizens, have very little when it comes to faith in our legal system.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889227564f164c7:0x27248d728f74b2d4"}
