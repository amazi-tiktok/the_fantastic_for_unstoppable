Overall, the cupcakes were all moist, very tasty but had slightly too much icing vs cupcake. The takeaway box had VERY little to be desired.

This was the day before Halloween, which was why i called to make sure I could get birthday cupcakes. When i arrived, i was given a box of 6 HALLOWEEN cupcakes. I dtated that i wanted birthday sprinkles and was then told \"well, its halloween tomorrow so were only making Halloween cupcakes\". I was disappointed because i had ordered ahead and was told it would be no problem. Then i was asked if i wanted to leave a tip. Which i did, reluctently (but thats on me). So paid over $20 for cupcakes, plus a $3 tip. It was not what i ordered and honestly, the yellow cupcakes were good but the chocolate ones were not, they were dry and seemed to be old. I had been there before and received great service and delicious cupcakes but this time, was very disappointed.
