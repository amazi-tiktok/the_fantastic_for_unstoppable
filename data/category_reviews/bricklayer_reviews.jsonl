What a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT!  Bryant Darby came for the initial consultation and was very thorough and detail oriented, so I could only assume the painters would follow suit. Long story short, the painters were absolutely terrible! The crew dripped paint EVERYWHERE.  Inside and outside of my house were covered in drips of white paint.  **UPDATE:  The paint drips were on a brand new deck (less than 2 years old); a new rug (less than 2 years old) and newly installed flowerbeds/rocks less than a month before the paint job.  THIS WAS NOT FROM A PREVIOUS PAINT JOB!!!!   Every time they returned to fix something, they'd leave their mark on something else.  It finally got to the point that I didn't even want them on my property any longer.  The lame attempt they made to clean up after themselves was laughable and I was ready to cut my losses** The house wasn't prepped correctly and I have fresh paint peeling already!   They broke bulbs on my string lights and not only didn't tell me, but didn't bother to clean it up!   This crew was completely lazy and careless.  I'm glad others had a pleasurable experiences with Altract, but I would award zero stars if google would allow.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1623942555535, "text": "Brian, I'm sorry you were unhappy with your painting experience.  The painters did come back to the house to clean off any drips and as we discussed with you onsite many of the drips were from the previous times the house was painted and could not be cleaned.  To my knowledge any drips or spills we were responsible for were cleaned from the house.  If you do have peeling paint from the current job we did for you please remember you have a 3 year warranty that covers any peeling, flaking, or fading. Likely this is not a product of incorrect prep but the conditions in which the paint was applied.  If any moisture gets trapped between the paint and the wood it will peel no matter how well the house was prepped.  This is why we offer the warranty we do.  Please feel free to contact us to schedule any necessary warranty work.  We are happy to fix anything we are responsible for."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889166f758133e3:0xb2e24817cff76e0b"}
