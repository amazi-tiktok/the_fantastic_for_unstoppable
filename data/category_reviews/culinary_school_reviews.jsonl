It's like Bed Bath & Beyond, but just the Beyond part and on steroids at that! All things kitchen can pretty much be found here.

Especially with the nice array of FANCY coffee machines that will gladly dispense samples for you.\n\nAlso, toward the back of the store they have a kitchen setup for group cooking classes. Again, imo on the pricey side but check the website because they sometimes have sales! The class we attended was nothing short of spectacular! The teacher was great, the format of cooking in teams worked well and ALL of the food we prepared in this particular class was amazing!
