As we heard it was busy on the weekends, we chose Tuesday to go to avoid the crowds. The picnic area at the top of the Falls does not open until 9 am, so we decided to hike the Desoto Falls Overlook Trail located outside the park first. The short, but rocky trail to the overlook was well worth the effort. At the end of the trail was a small rock outcrop that formed a smooth platform, just barely big enough for two adults to stand side by side. From this rock, you can view Desoto Falls from above. The Falls sit nearly center in a bowl of jagged rock cliffs and drop 104 feet into a large lake in the canyon below. The view was humbling.\n\nAfter our hike on the overlook trail, we headed to the Desoto Falls picnic area to view the falls from the top. The picnic area has three levels to view the falls: From the top, looking over the dam, is the historic, but now defunct, A.A. Miller Dam built in 1925 for the first hydroelectric power in Alabama. Above the dam is a lake where visitors can swim, kayak, and canoe.\n\nThere is a set of concrete steps leading down from the top to the middle overlook. Each step is decorated in colorful reflective tiles, some spelling words of a famous naturalist, John Muir, a reminder that \u201cEverybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul.\u201d In the middle  are a series of broad falls whee the water pools and channels before its final descent. Follow the path around the rocks and down to the lower overlook where you can see a ribbon-like side view of the 104-foot drop of the falls into the canyon. There is a trail that takes you to the bottom of the falls, but we did not do it this trip.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrioregL094cnWZmy803HpW3ZtDgqkqSk7SljK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrUVH4BT88KNadwcGxMsk6lG1CxVP5UKYvotAp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbe6bi_c4IgkLlIMvfjA7I6_ECgX0bzmy_6kPx=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlt52bfX35qBNmDQluwerYSVqmOZAKYdbBtDIF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo1cClcYAArpBAxoATMHVCKkAn_gEFsGy70RYc=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2Q3CAz8gYHt4Weoq7mXwb3rW3xXYP1NX5VY0n=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88602d761a4181c9:0xaa73c05bef7d7b4a"}

In 1 mile, it dead ends at one end of the trail (as of 9/17). This is being developed as a boat ramp entrance.\n\n2. On Hwy 69 in Fairview, drive west toward Cullman to the second yellow light at Fairview town limits. Turn left (south) on County Road 1662 (at  sign for Antioch Missionary Baptist). Go 1.5 miles, dog leg Left-Right at Antioch Church. You are now on Co. Rd. 1660, and it dead ends in 2 miles. Park and it's a short walk down the hill and through the wooden gate. This is less than 2 miles from the end of the trail above (as of 9/2017).\n\n3. From Holly Pond, head west on Hwy 278. Pass the white fences on the right with the sign to the cowboy church at the edge of the fence. Take a right Co Rd 1651 (not the road with the small junk yard, the next road opposite a sign for Duck River Baptist). When the road widens, you will come to the new handicapped accessible pier on the left. Park and this is the other end of the trail (as of 9/2017).\n\n4. Follow directions #3 from Holly Pond but keep  going past the pier. A couple of miles farther, the road will end at the main trailhead.

So, here\u2019s some info.  I did a just over 4 mi loop. Doubletree to Trail, walking up 20th St S, is about one mile, mostly uphill. (Don\u2019t follow google\u2019s directions to the Vulcan man, if you want to see him too, because there\u2019s some insanity to it - it\u2019s a shorter walk, and the parking lot is before the \u201chook.\u201d)  This walk will lose the sidewalk on 20th for a bit but it\u2019s just a short stretch.\nIt\u2019s about one mile from the start of the trail to the junction of 11th Pl S. (Hard right turn, downhill - you can\u2019t miss it.) You could probably shorten this up a tad if you go down the steps through the apartment complex below.\nThen, it\u2019s about 2 miles back. I walked downhill 11th Pl S to where I walked around a business to 10th Ave S past the campus. There\u2019s a ton of construction on campus right now but you can walk through.\nOverall, very pleasant. The trail is mostly shaded, with good views.

You will go nearly 1,300ft down and back up the ravine. The trail can be nearly 6-7 miles in length if you push all the way to the back of the gorge (out + back). There are also plenty of places to step off the trail and do some exploring. The stoney riverbanks were a ton of fun to pick around and added some extra joy and length to our trip.\n\nThe trailhead here has two handicap accessible portable toilets for those in need, and the gravel parking lot is right off a paved road. There are no trash receptacles, you'll need to pack out.

The trail is well marked with red blazes on trees about every 10 feet or so. If you are hiking at dusk or at night, be sure to look for them closely on the switchback portion of the trail. There are two log bridges to cross, currently being replaced with sturdier concrete and steel bridges. The trail is very steep at points and is also pretty narrow. Make sure to bring plenty of water!! The horseback riding trail crosses the foot hiker trail twice. Once you cross the second bridge, you can choose to go along the top of the Walls of Jericho or go into the Walls of Jericho. My group opted to go into the Walls. It is definitely worth the hike!!

Have at least a gallon of water per person(for the trip in) another gallon for the trip out. Very old cemetery in the valley before the ascent to the walls along with a primitive campground for tents and small campfires. The hurricane creek is teeming with different aquatic life if you venture down the creek with a fishing pole you can catch some of the best tasting fish you've ever eaten. Again this isn't a beginners trail and there are plenty of wildlife in those woods, snakes included. After your endeavor to the walls is complete the hike out is up the mountain so be prepared to get winded.
