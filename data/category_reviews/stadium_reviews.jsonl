This is what I will review..\n\nUAB set up a vaccination site at the Hoover Met recently. It is an excellent choice of venue for giving drive-through vaccines. The large parking area is perfect for streaming through cars and lining up cars. It is off any major highway or heavily trafficked roadway. The UAB team have set up several pop-up pavilions wide enough to accommodate cars and UAB team members. The process is very simple and well-organized. I made my appointment through the UAB patient portal website. I noticed that the website made me a second appointment for my second vaccination 3 weeks after my first.  Very convenient. I arrived at my appointment time. There were people out directing traffic in the parking lot. At the first pavillion, a UAB team member gathered my name and appointment time, checked my ID, gave me a short form to fill-in and sign, then directed me to pull to the next pavilion, straight ahead. At the second pavilion, a UAB team member collected the form, gave the vaccination and immunization card and directed me to pull ahead to the waiting area. At the waiting area, a UAB team member greeted me, we conversed and they gave me instructions on how to alert them in case I had an adverse reaction to the shot. They made note of the time I received the vaccination and at what time the 15 minute wait period expired. During my wait, a UAB team member check on me verbally no less than 3x, other UAB team members would give me a nod or ask loudly to a group of cars how we were doing. The wait period flew by and I was on my way. From start to end the entire process took less than 45 minutes, probably around 30 minutes. I didn't time it. Overall, they were as well-organized as any Chick-fil-A drive-through and just as nice. Shout-out to the entire UAB team and any volunteers! Y'all Rocked It Out! Thank you for your hard work! Because y'all cared enough to be there, we are all one-step closer to normal.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcpaZ7F46dAwwJcrJKUoH_CRB6rfPthUYWnJe8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921111e061de1:0xdd0f67408816698e"}
