I texted Prestige from my emergency flight from Mexico and Barry, the owner, was beyond compassionate and professional, and had a great driver waiting on me.\nThe car was immaculate but more importantly, was there early, and both the owner and driver so sensitive to my situation. The driver told me when we were nearing my Mother's house to just get out and run in and he would bring everything inside, which he did.  I literally do not know if I would have gotten all the way down to my Mother's house that night without Prestige.\nI had the same professional experience booking today for my niece's pre wedding events and look forward to using Prestige for the wedding as well.

Mr. Fields (the owner) and his team are professional, pleasant, courteous, and safe drivers. They arrive on time, are up-to-date on any possible traffic delays with alternate routes ready, and know their client preferences (e.g., unique pick-up or drop-off locations; interior temperature; music, etc.). The team also are cognizant of any flight issues whether going to or leaving the airport. Several of my flights this past year have been delayed and I have been able to text/email/call to reschedule without further delay but in most cases, as soon as I knew of the schedule disruption, I received a text from the driver that they knew of the change already and would be there waiting for me as soon as I landed. Mr. Fields also is a wealth of assistance for transportation needs outside Alabama and has a network of colleagues with whom he can instantly connect you with. For example, when trying to get back to Alabama when a major airline had multiple disruptions and left thousands of travelers stranded in Atlanta, he was able to text within minutes of my request the names and numbers of several local companies who could get me back home. I appreciate this level of consistent service. Such proactive problem-solving and communication put me at ease knowing that my ride would be there \u2013 no matter how late the flight would arrive. I have made several last-minute requests (e.g., forgot to reserve a ride; had a game day request) over the year and they were able to accommodate them. The evening before each reservation, I receive an email confirming the pick-up time which is a helpful reminder and an opportunity to make any changes. I also receive a text or call from the driver a few minutes before each pick-up. That way, I know who to expect, if there will be any delays (never have been), or other changes in my reservation. Making a reservation with Prestige is easy to do with drop-down menus on my computer or phone. Also, the Prestige transportation fleet is clean and new with multiple options for any occasion. I have recommended Prestige to my colleagues and friends. Prestige offers an exemplary array of 24/7 services of which I will continue to use \u2013 in fact I already have multiple future reservations confirmed. Prestige, Mr. Fields, and his team are a true asset to those who need quality, safe, cost effective, and friendly transportation services.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88861ca840eba2e3:0x5be2b74d18997623"}

Not only did BARRY greet me so kindly, he made me feel so at ease that my son would make it to the airport the VERY NEXT MORNING ON TIME AND SAFE. He picked my son up on time, was waiting early and even texted me that he was in the car.. I have used several other services to get my son to the airport in the past but no more. I am loyal to BARRY AND PRESTIGE LIMO from here on out. I highly reccomended him today to another mother and she too was very impressed. Their pricing is great and for a mama who is 3,000 miles away in California I feel such ease knowing my son is in great hands. If you are a parent who needs a ride or a student I cannot reccomend this company more. You will not be sorry.. I promise.. this man is a Saint! I just hope when the word spreads we can still get a ride, that he won't be too booked. Fantastic BARRY sure knows how to be professional and treat a customer.\nThank you SO much!

According to broker Sisi, she was canceling because our truck didn\u2019t \u201cfit the needs of the load because of weight restriction\u201d even though we had discussed our available equipment and weight capacity prior to procceding with booking and she still confirmed us with rate con. We received cancelation at around 6pm eastern time (most brokers stop posting around 5pm and most good loads are already booked at that time) when I brought this up to her attention her reply was \u201cwell get your ass back on the boards and book another like everyone else instead of wasting time complaining to me!\u201d She also said to me \u201cI don\u2019t know what country you are from...\u201d as to imply because of my last name that I was either illiterate or illegal \u201cbut around here almost 24 hr notice is more than enough time for a cancelation.\u201d No where in our signed rate confirmation or contract did it say they don\u2019t pay truck not in use fees if they give \u201cplenty of notice\u201d. This caused my company  loss in wages as I still had to pay my driver and I missed out on an awesome paying load from a direct customer because we were already committed to Expedited Transport when the load was offered to us. Not only did they cancel the load and refused to pay compensation but the broker used foul and derogatory language and was completely unprofessional in handling our request for compensation. I reached out to the owner Tom Cross who pretty much said that the military is \u201cwishy washy and that they have to cancel loads often because the military likes to change the items of the shipment without notice.\u201d I noted to him that had I been told this with anticipation I would\u2019ve opted to go into business with a different broker company rather than them because it\u2019s poor business to be left up in the air and asked him if they advise of this on their contract because i did not see such a thing. He said that he would review it again and if it wasn\u2019t that we could take up the conversation again. Upon reviewing it myself one more time I reached out to him because their was nothing advising the carrier that they don\u2019t compensate for canceled loads. He never answered or returned my calls instead he sent me an email saying the industry standard is the day before without TONU.

Michael called me shortly thereafter and when I explained the various car rides I would require, he was careful to check his calendar to make sure he could accommodate me.\nDuring the trip, Michael was very professional.  He always arrived early- including at the airport, at the hotel, and at the meeting locations.  He was always considerate to text me that he had arrived, but that there was no rush.  And most importantly, he did a great job planning the pickup times that would allow me to arrive at my destination in a timely manner.  There was one trip for which Michael was not available (and for which he had warned me in advance) and the person he arranged as backup was equally professional.\nI don\u2019t plan on returning to Birmingham in the near future, but if I do the first thing I will do is arrange to use Alabama Sedan again.

They text me updates for the half-hour before pickup, to ease any possible uncertainty, and text upon their arrival (which averages about 10 minutes early).  Michael and his drivers are friendly, courteous, kind, and helpful, and their vehicles are clean and luxurious.  I use them for ALL my business travel (at least one trip a month), as does my wife, and I have recommended them to numerous colleagues (whose experiences mirror our own).  I also use them for personal travel as well - even in instances where I could just drive to the airport and park - because the experience is so positive.

Both times waited over an hour and a half.  This past time, Tuesday June 30th, I had a truck reserved at 8:00 per the app.  When I arrived there were 3 customers waiting outside.  Several employees,  I'd say 4-5 were sitting inside a cubicle talking while 1 person was washing cars. Apparently they don't clean any vehicle until the customer is there waiting.  They would casually check people in as they come up.  An hour later, I was still waiting with about 20 other people.  A gentleman questioned them about this, and they told him it was always an hour minimum wait for a vehicle there.  He took pictures of the one person washing.  They did not like this and asked him not to, then 3 started washing.  I inquired several times about the remaining wait time, and was told each time I was next up.  I clearly was not because I reserved a truck and could see no trucks being cleaned.  Even though the Hertz app showed no trucks, I called Hertz (AT 9:45) in desperation due a meeting I had several hours away.  The nice lady had 1 truck just returned and said she could have it ready once she sent it to the airport Hertz to be detailed.  I explained my frustration with Enterprise, and she told me to come on and get it.  She went out and cleaned it herself and had it ready when I made the 10-15 minute drive to Hertz.  I was in and out within 10 minutes of arriving.  I would pay double and go with Hertz vs. Enterprise now.

To have these 3 in place, it is essential to provide to the client a copy of such procedures. All drivers were on time, dispatchers answered calls clearly. However on my second ride I had the unfortunate mishap of leaving medication within the van. They have no formal policy notated on site for events such as this. The following were their response: 1).\"We cannot call the transporter ( what if an appointment is canceled or their is an emergency shouldn't MTA have a contact procedure)\";2) We don't know where the driver is located , 3:) We will mail you your medication ( medication is essential to everyone's health, being that you are transporting individuals who are sick ad disabled);4) The driver will bring a card swipe to charge you for your item(s) that you left; 5) We will place it in the mail COD and you will pay for postage; 6) No we don't send the driver with a swipe cared to charge you ; How much is the charge? Answer: I don\"t know, Question: When will he come? Answer I don't know ;7), I will call you back at the end of the drivers shift to see if medication was found; 8) Can't you call your doctor  for more medication and pay. No follow-up calls were made. These were the previous responses.A Medical transport Service would have in place a CB or cell phone to contact the driver in case of cancellations, lost items, or medications such as within my case. I am not excusing my fault for leaving the medication as I have a bladder issues and was in a rush to get to the bathroom. However, It is stated on their website that a policy to have open communication from the dispatcher to the drivers is needed and are in place in all probability, however the supervisor failed or refused to use such action available to her to secure my property (medication). Drivers excellent safe, timely, customer service courteous. However those who implement any policy known or unknown to to they are in need of training, or the owner or person(s) in charge has not provided such polices, such for medications left in van, etc, and may be in violations of Medicaid and the Disabilities act. Example a person has seizures leaves medication in van, they in turn contact MTA to return medication, MTA state they will mail the medication without immediately contacting the driver who can within 1 minute find the medication ad secure it from being obtained from the next rider who may find and keep the medication. Meanwhile said rider has a seize. The question remains would mailing the medication to the ride help and stop a seizure. In my case , I called before the driver got to the corner on my block which would have only took 1.5 minutes to turn and return medication, without disruption of his route timing. I am requesting a copy of MTA polices to be distributed to all riders. This is only fair. I gave three stars for excellent customer service, excellent driver riding experience as they were wonderful, but  stars were decreased due to my allegations of lack in mismanagement either on the part of the acting manager or the owner(s). Customer service and drivers look to management for training and guidance.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e0a27a008d1b:0x4f1593e8cf0ff73"}

I paid their deposit of $150 after they first quoted $100 and quoted first $800 then $850 to do the job. My son signed the contract and then the issues started. They were supposed to pick up my car on March 26, 2021 so it could get to Trenton Tx by end of March. They never called and I had to call them. Told me the driver is running late will call in the AM of March 27, 2021. Never called and no pick up. This repeated for 2 days. No one ever called back and I always had to chase them. Finally, a supervisor called back told me they driver was AWOL, the guy John who I was dealing with was fired and now they have to find a new driver,  like that was my fault. Took them days to get back to me after I spoke to another supervisor who said she would call back and guess what\u2026 no call back. Finally, they said the had a new driver and it would cost $1400 with $150 already paid so I would have to pay the driver $1250. After my son already signed a contract for $850. When I asked for a discount for my trouble and extra cost to rent my rental car for another week they told me no.

When I asked for a replacement, I was given a vehicle with 47,000 miles on it that apparently had not been thoroughly checked. By that evening, the key fob was acting up. By the next morning, the battery was dead. After reporting to Hertz, I had to unload the car in the rain, catch a ride with a friend, and continue my meetings, then catch a Lyft to the airport. Hertz sent for a tow truck to get the car, which was picked up at 9:48 on Thu 25 Oct. Yet Hertz charged me for two extra days that I did not use, and then to add insult to injury, also added a late fee. All this after having been on the phone with Hertz 5 times that morning to get their car taken care of. I explained all this to the agents at MOB; they gave me the number of their manager, whom I called and left a voicemail for. I received no call back. When I called the corporate office about the bill, I was told I would get a $20 discount on the bill--even though they charged me for two extra days that I didn't even have the car.\nAfter 22 years of being a customer, I mistakenly thought I would be treated better than this.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb22075d6ba07:0x7da3af36f8a5bdb6"}

It made me an hour late to my destination.\n\nAfter I dropped the car off, I pulled up my receipt online a few weeks later and realized I'd been charged double what they'd told me on the phone. They have a 24-hour policy and will charge you for two days if you don't return the car within 24 hours. I was not told this was the case; when I booked, I told them my plans for pick-up time and drop-off time, and they told me the price. Likewise, I told them when I'd return the car the morning I picked it up, and still no one said it would be a two-day charge. Lastly, when I dropped the vehicle off, no one told me I would be charged for two days.\n\nI called to discuss the two-day charge with the staff and was met with rigidity, interruptions and hostility -- absolutely no care or concern for the issues at hand and, obviously, absolutely no attempts to rectify what I perceived as an intentional misunderstanding meant to charge me for two days instead of for the single-day reservation.\n\nLastly, this is a privately owned location, so any concerns you have cannot be addressed by the broader Hertz company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583289040894, "text": "James, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review at Hertz Car Rental.
