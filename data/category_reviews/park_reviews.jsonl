Shoal Bass are a Protected Species on the Chattahoochee. Please don't eat them. The Spotted Bass are good and plentyful. Eat them.\nHave Fun, be careful. Those rocks are slick and painful.\nWatch your kids. Current can be dangerous and the water levels fluctuate about 4 feet, sometimes faster than others. Call the WP Dam generation schedule. Allow 2-3 hours for the water to make getting to the dam easier, but Never easy. Wear PFDs at All Times above the Riverview ramp in boats or kayak.\nAlso Please leave it cleaner than you found it. Its just the Right Thing to Do.\nYall already have nice pix. I may add my Eagle pix later.\nEnjoy, but Respect.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cbad97b3d9253:0x90028e9d98ce1271"}

My wife went to the office to ask about a cabin. One was avail, so we booked that for the remaining 3 days. We asked since no one was in the camping area could we please take our time after\u00a0sunset to remove our tent, cooking stove, etc. Laura in the office said no problem at all. In about 10 minutes Donnie pulls up in a golf cart. He said another man was coming in a truck. When he got there, they were going to pack our things for us and bring everything to the cabin. Paul arrived in 5 minutes, told us not to do anything but tell him how we want things done. He and Donnie took down our tent, packed our things, put our coolers and dry food in their truck. They drove our things to the cabin and brought everything in for us. In 90+ degree heat, and not even being asked. These people saved our vacation, and with me being in a wheelchair, and my wife's age, made our workload very easy. I wrote several reviews, and am writing you.

They also had a fire pit with a grill top at each camp site, which was very enjoyable to cook hotdogs, hamburgers, and smores on. We were also given the opportunity to rent either kayaks or a small boat with a motor -- we ended up renting the boat with a motor. We had one of the best times out on the water although we got rained out within the first 30 minutes of boating.

There was a a softball area but it just appeared by us using that area as such...Not something really built by the city.. There was a shallow grass ditch that ran thru the middle and went out on Oak St. The grass was very nice and kept. However we never saw any city workers, ever. There was a couple of large bushes and a shade tree... We looked for 4 leaf clovers in the grass...There was actually 4 ways to enter the park....Bart Starr and family lived on National Ave. near that entrance....Everybody hung out in the park with their dogs and bicycles.....I got to ride my first motorcycle in the park...I was 13...Jerry Palmer let me ride his Harley 165... Gatewood Walden also rode his 165 to the park sometime. There was never any rules against anything and it all went great...no problems. Usually there would only be a handful of kids in the park.... No crowds...Never saw any grownups... Hope maybe some older folks comment on their early years in Ridgecrest,,,,I enjoyed my time living there...

The campground is actually a trailer park with some spots for camping. We stay in many campgrounds, some better than others, but this is the first time we have driven through a campground and left. I could not even find the camp office to begin with and everybody at the trailer park was staring us down when we drove through.\n\nWhen I couldn't find the office, I called the owner back to tell her we had changed our minds. She did not answer her phone. I got a phone call later on from a different number and it was the owner. I let her know that her park was not what we expected and that we had changed our minds. She got an attitude with me and said, \"Thanks for letting me know. I waited for you for over an hour.\" I then informed her that I had tried to call and she didn't answer. I did not bother to mention that she wasted an hour of my time and the gas that I used to drive to her disappointment of a trailer park that she is trying to pass off as a campground.

After we spoke, I did see that you had called the office number, which is supposed to be transferred to my cell phone. So I called you at 6:10 and we both missed each other. I apologize for my shortness, I have no excuse for that except that 14 hour days, 7 days a week sometimes gets me overwhelmed.   I'm usually pretty nice.

And one last thing- I was told to cancel it would take 14 days to get my refund less the 10 damn dollars !!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d2be094f2d93d:0x2468c1a3120abb57"}

Just 30 minutes south of Columbus, GA or Phenix, City (I didn't spell it wrong) Alabama Bluff Creek this weekend was very quiet. There were maybe 12 camp sites occupied of 83 available. Camp host and campers all said it was unusual for the second weekend after Memorial Day Weekend. If you use the COE website for reservations know that the camp map says sites have no access to the water / lake. Even if the map shows campsites up next to the water, understand that the campsite overlooks the lake and inlets, but from 6 to 8 feet directly above the campsite. For many campsites, you can see the water, but would have to have a rope ladder to access the water.\nThis is one of the smaller COE parks we know of on the Chattahoochee River. The property is well kept as are the bathhouses with laundry. This campground is very fisherman friendly with a screened in fish cleaning station and cleaning tables at every site. Most of the sites are separated by 30 feet of dense brush. Most sites are deeply shaded. (Ours was so shaded we needed the interior lights in the trailer at high noon.) Most sites are easy to back into. Only those along the Bluff Creek side have direct access to the water. There is only one thing that is a drawback, and that is the pulpwood mill adjacent to the park on the Mill Creek side. When we go back, and we will go back, we will camp on the Bluff Creek side and put a little more room between us and the pulp mill.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d2be094f2d93d:0x2468c1a3120abb57"}

If you use Google Maps, it will take you to this post-apocalyptic set of dilapidated town-houses.  (Seriously, Hollywood should film their next zombie flick there!). Just continue down on Northgate Drive until it dead ends.  If you look to your left, there is a car path through the grass.  Take that and then park by the creek.  There's a big water pipe that you can use as a bridge to cross into the \"park.\"  This was our first time.  There was no trail per se, just a wide area that we could walk.  We walked it to the fence on the end and walked back.  I didn't see any marked hiking trails, but agree that this has HUGE potential.  Make sure you bring bug spray and clothes/shoes that you don't mind getting dirty.

Trees line every fairway and there are no open shots. It is not super dense foliage and there is usually an opportunity to save par on an errant drive if you get creative. There are a lot of short par 4s (around 425 feet) which creates birdie opportunities. A good player could probably eagle a few. Perhaps that\u2019s why it\u2019s called the eagle!  Unfortunately the baskets on holes 16 and 17 were missing on my round. The course wraps around a large dog park and there is a nice walking trail as well.\n\nOverall this was a very enjoyable course. It\u2019s not that difficult, but there is just the right amount of challenge to keep you engaged. There are no \u201csignature holes\u201d per say and a lot of the holes are similar in style.

We love the ramp area. Plenty of room and it is maintained very well. However, we decided to give it a go and camp last night. This was a different experience. Our family was harassed and attacked by the campground attendants the entire 18 hours that we were there. The flyer says park on concrete or gravel and no more than 2 vehicles not including recreational vehicles. Well, my daughter parked in the gravel and we made sure she didn't protrude in the street but we received a notice saying she couldn't park there. We weren't even finished reading the notice when the attendant came flying through the campground on a golf cart yelling from the road that she couldn't park there. We repeatedly told the man that she is leaving. She was literally in the car and he was still telling us over and over that now we cannot park there and no more than 2 cars. My husband explained that we are aware and she is leaving. We had our other vehicle at the lake ramp all day and were simply swapping vehicles the the man couldn't understand this information. He was irrate and again, yelling from the road. The next morning we were leaving early because it was storming. My son pulled out ahead of us and pulled to the side to wait on us and the boat so he could follow us home. Immediately, the angry man came out again yelling at him that he cannot park where he was. He wasn't parked. He pulled over at the trash dumpster where we were otw to dump trash and leave. This man and his wife were horrible hosts. We didn't feel comfortable or at ease the entire day or night. We are clean and respectable people. My husband was a scout leader and highly aware of rules of the federal and state public lands. These gatekeepers ruined our evening and we will not risk returning here again for the mistreatment we received.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnN62ytyE24H9KGWQGRrSX1aghyKffoMOplZ3v=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88886cbfc92cc725:0x283f43b38cb5122f"}

The campground is very clean and check-in was very efficient, which reflects on the host's hard work and attention to details.  The campground is quite and orderly.\nMost sites are spacious and spread out from other sites. On line, it appears there are just a handful of sites available to reserve, but in reality, there are many more sites available as walk up sites. There are more back-in sites than pull thru sites, as well as a few primative tent sites. All the pull thru sites are located in the Yellowhamer loop. There is room for most big rigs.  The best part of this campground is there are full hook ups at all the sites, except the primitive tent sites. There are no water front sites and about 8 water view sites, the rest of the sites are forest view. Most sites are fairly level and partial shade to full shade. The trees along the roads are trimmed back.\nThere are 2 boat launches in the park. There is the \"camper's boat launch \" which is located between the Yellowhamer loop and the Firefly loop. This launch has enough room to launch 1 boat at a time, but no dock to load or unload passengers. The \"public boat launch \" is located about 1\\2 a mile from the campground sites. This is a  2 boat launch with a nice new shiny dock to load and unload passengers.\nOther reviewers have mentioned the remoteness of this location. These reviews are spot on. The closest store is about 15 mins away. Walmart is about 45 mins to an hour away too! Be prepared and plan meals accordingly.  There is a great marina/inn/restaurant only 5 miles away if you need a break from cooking and it also has the only bar for miles around!\nThere are only a couple of downsides to this place, but they can be dealt with with proper planning. #1 negative is TICKS! You HAVE to expect this, as this is a National Forest! SO, bring your DEET or other preferred repellant!  #2. The campground does not accept credit cards for walk-sites. Again, be prepared to use cash.\nWe have really enjoyed our stay here. What drew us to this remote, beautiful forest lake was the nationally-acclaimed clarity of the lake water. . . We were not disappointed!  We can't wait to come again in the warmer months when we can play in the water all day!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88886cbfc92cc725:0x283f43b38cb5122f"}

But at the end, you're rewarded with two really nice waterfalls. To reach them you have to know they're there. The first one is easiest to get to. After about 3.5 miles from the trailhead you'll start down a steep descent. The trail will level off briefly at a small campsite. Turn around and take a few steps back the way you came and you'll see a fork that you probably walked right by without noticing. Take that fork to the left. In less than 5 minutes you'll be at a very nice waterfall in the wet season (early to mid spring, or after a significant rainfall)\n\nThe second waterfall is much harder to get to, but worth the effort. Go back to the campsite and continue going the way you were originally going. The trail gets much steeper. Yes, I said much steeper...so be careful and watch your footing. You'll soon come to a trail crossing. Take a left and follow that for a couple minutes. You'll come to a small creek that feeds into the larger Sipsey river on your right. Turn left at that creek. There's a trail there that is well defined in spots, and hard to follow in other spots. Just keep going with that creek on your right. Keep going until you reach the waterfall", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU_uPCEzTRupN5O04srV6pliXALfYDy3L6itTO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzwFsWFC0VR1eCaMCJhhLLzaNtJnGjak2iedNd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5n4PO8R9hy0OZB_4xCpYh4Pz4wL9gNzF8aPAy=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZLWQ-aAClWnxePV98C-tVw5G35Zj4JCYKAp8j=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV4ViMH3Ei31LbOF4vncorGzaUwi63UtOzeRwX=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888808b9f2e40835:0x52bda1b6ea66bcb8"}
