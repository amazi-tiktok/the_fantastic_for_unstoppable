We decided not to go forward when we finally visited the school and saw that most of the staff and students can barely speak proper english. I do not understand the need to be secretive about the application process when students that are already accepted and attending are not even excelling. It really is sad. Upon doing further research, I saw that the reading proficiency of students is only at 50% and the math proficiency is only 47%. That is horrible. Just look at the reviews from parents and students.
