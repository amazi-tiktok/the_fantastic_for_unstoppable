Looking for a good food truck experience and feeling like I want to indulge in some carbs today, I found this little jewel on Facebook.\n\nIt's in a parking lot right off of Holcombe Ave, you can't miss it. It's next to a barbershop, so there's limited parking.\n\nYou walk up to the window to place your order. They have several pictures so you can get an idea of what they offer. I also recommended going to their Facebook page for more pictures and the menu. There's so much to choose from I think it's best to make a decision before you get there or you might get a little carried away, which is okay too.\n\nCustomer service was okay. Now let's get to the food.\n\nDecided to just go all in, so I can sample a few things and got the $18 box with  cheeseburger, wings and Big Top fries.\n\nWhen you place your order they don't get a name, they just tell you how long it's going to be, she told me 15 minutes. I waited a little longer than 15 minutes but it wasn't a big deal, when I did get everything it was hot and delicious.\n\nThe burger was small but it was very good. It had a nice sear on the patty, the bun was soft, the tomato and the lettuce were fresh, it was great. The wings were fried just like I like them, crispy. The sauce, I'm not sure what it was, but it was fantastic. I could have sucked the bones on these wings, they were absolutely amazing.\n\nBut the star of the show, definitely,  were these Big Top fries. We're talking smooth, creamy cheese, shrimp, bacon, and some type of steak.  Baabee, woo, so good.\n\nLet me tell you something, make your way to Holcombe Ave,  get a plate of deliciousness and tell me all about it. Shoot, if you let me know 24 hours in advance, I might even meet you over there.\n\nThose fries though. The flavor was delicious.  The cheese kissed every single fry.  The fries, soaked with this creamy deliciousness, we're still crispy enough to handle it.  \"Muah\"\n\nCheck these guys out if you're ever in the area!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4facdffbd27b:0xf18fd7e30b7fdfb6"}

I've been here for 6 months now.  The first few weeks, I came here to eat several times but each time it just kept getting worse.  Now, it's almost the last place I'll go and eat at.\nThere were times when I walk up to order, only one ordering, and it's like I'm not there.  They keep talking to each other, though they saw me walk up.  It's like they have to finish up on talking about their lives or other people and then they can help you.  it's my lunch break...I don't have time for you guys to finish.  I need my food so I can go back to work.\nAlso, when they cut up my steak, then cut up someone else's raw chicken, then go back to fixing up my steak...I'm pretty sure that's a health violation and dangerous.  They preach that you never cross contaminate but these folks do.  I just pray that the spatula they are using is super hot and kills the salmonella.\nAlso, if I get the special fries that come with ranch on it...I don't need 80% ranch, and 10% fries.  I like ranch on my fries but not drowning in ranch so much it comes out of the to go carrier box.  Then I have to toss them in the garbage.\nThe folks here need real management or a better supervisor.  Cause at the moment, I know myself and others where I work, will not go back.  Places like this need to get away with hooking friends and family up.  That's all I see on Ft Rucker and probably why most things go down hill.
