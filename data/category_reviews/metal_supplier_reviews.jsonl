Glynn(who\u2019s family owns the business) was my\u201dLow Pressure\u201dsales person,who remained completely calm as I changed my mind 3-4 times.LOL I ended up with building with regular looking eves with overhang. I ended up having 3 sides closed in. I had contacted 3-4 other places and was left with little reassurance that they would even show up,and they all wanted the spot to be level within 3-4 inches,my spot was sloping at least 12 inches,I explained this to Glynn and he compensated for it\u201dno problem\u201d. So far a\u201dsmooth talker\u201dcould have led me along,now it\u2019s time to actually build something. The crew,Alben and Richard showed up early with a nice\u201dbusiness looking\u201drig:a nice heavy duty pickup with a nice trailer,not a\u201dRag-Tag\u201dlooking outfit. All of their cordless tools were Milwaukee brand and neatly stowed. They snapped a chalk line for the screws and did a great job\u201dboxing in\u201dthe corners and enclosing the the far end.

I was transferred to a salesman. After I explained what I needed, he repeated three times: we have (name of product). No more, no less. I was not encouraged to ask any more questions about the product he named. He then advised me to check Google, and after I did that, to call back and tell them whether what they had was what I needed.\nI was driving, so I pulled over and Googled the product he mentioned. It looked good, so I called back. He was on the phone so I drove over to the business.\nA gentleman with a radio met me outside and was very cordial. He called the same salesman on the radio and, per my request, asked what the price was. I could clearly overhear the salesman on the other end.\nHe said \"we have to get these customers to start calling in.\" He stated the price, then asked for my name and I gave it. He asked if it would be cash and I relayed that it would be my debit card. He could not find my name in the system (I have done light business there in the past and last time my name was in the system.) He then told the gentleman on the radio that I was not in the system and would have to call in my order and credit card information, then I could come back and buy the single item that I needed.\nI left and found the product I needed at a steel supply in Montgomery.\nI'm not a huge commercial contractor, and I don't represent much money to these businesses. But I'm still a prospective customer. I have always had a great and pleasant experience at Alabama Steel, pre-Covid and during Covid. Today was .not typical but it sure made me feel that it didn't matter if I took my money elsewhere. Kudos to the outside sales guy, though.\nBut there is a silver lining: because of this negative experience,  I found an alternate steel business which displays professionalism, great customer skills and makes me feel valued, no matter how small my purchase may be.
