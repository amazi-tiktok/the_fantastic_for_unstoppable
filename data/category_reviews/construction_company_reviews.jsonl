The next day Keith (our PM) came back to make sure things were done as he expected followed by our original \"salesman\" (that term is so inadequate) Kyle coming out the following day to walk the roof and the grounds and write up a final \"punch list\".

We settled on what we wanted and got on the schedule.  The materials were delivered a day before and I noticed that the supply company sent the wrong decking (I asked to special order a specific type), Kyle and the job foreman, Keith, came out first thing the next morning and swapped out the decking in their own trucks before the roofers even needed to start using it.  Finally, after it was all done Kyle came back for a post inspection. He found some corners in these uncommonly-designed window wells I have that needed a bit more flashing to make sure water would never get in there again.

Our screen patio is structurally extremely sturdy and completely leak free even in the worst of our downpours and it looks fabulous and adds so much curb appeal to our home. I can not say enough good stuff about this company and its people other than they are totally awesome and in my opinion build an extremely high quality product. Other companies were going to charge extra for several things that were included in our bid. They were not the cheapest bid for our project but we did get everything we paid for and then some.

The backyard was approx 110 ft and open to all, no privacy. I watched the crew scalp the old lawn and graded down to a more level surface. Then they planted about 20 trees which served as a privacy fence. Mixed in a variety of bushes and plants. I could only imagine how it would look when all planting matured. They laid new sod and it looked like a picture from Home and Garden magazine.\n\nThrough the years I have visited my brother and his family and he\u2019d take me on job sites with him. I was amazed to see the complexity of installs he was undertaking. The attention to detail David gives to each install is second to none. I could write a few pages just on that subject. (But I won\u2019t) His new store AquaScapes was an overnight success. I tribute this to David\u2019s insight of products as well as knowledge of the industry. Offering fountains, fish ponds, fish of course and swimming pools from the store, has only broadened the DSLD complete landscape portfolio.\n\nI have to tip my hat to my brother and his team of professionals. His sons Zachary, Miles and Cole play a major part in this well oiled machine as they each have a part in most every install. They are dependable, punctual and treat each job as if it were being installed on their property.\n\nRather you have DSLD perform their expertise on your yard or not, you have to admire how far they have come.\n\nWishing you all continued success!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893e19213388e5:0xeb3f3999b720c596"}

They are professionals in every sense of the word.\nThey have done multiple projects for myself and my wife. They are what I would call...outdoor wizards!\nThey have installed amazing landscape lighting for us, completely redesigned our shrub and flower beds, and installed the most awesome landscape masonry borders I\u2019ve ever seen. I have a large fountain in one of the shrub beds in the front of my house. Mind you, this thing weighs like a bazillion lbs. I was recently trying to clean it out and get it ready for Spring and Summer. I accidentally let the bowl tip off the pedestal. Well, I tried to lift it up and get it back on the pedestal. I suppose I\u2019m not as young as I used to be, because I couldn\u2019t budge it. I really didn\u2019t know what to do, so I called DSLD and asked if they could come by and get this monster back on the pedestal. It wasn\u2019t more than a day later, when I got in from work when I noticed that my fountain was sitting upright, filled with water, just waiting to be plugged in. When I called Zach Sharp, ( a great young man by the way) to ask what I owed them, he absolutely refused to take a cent, saying it only took a few minutes and I could not get them to take anything for their time and trouble. In today\u2019s world, qualities like that are rare. If you ever need any type of landscape architecture, a pool, anything \u201coutdoorsy\u201d,\nThese are the guys.

The project involved demo of some existing kitchen cabinets, replacement of a cook top and stove with a range, replacement of a vent hood, installing new kitchen lighting, laying tile, painting cabinets and bookshelves, painting trim, and painting walls.  All of this was handled by David's crew without having to sub out any work. The quality of the work done was really top-tier.  We used David's decorating consultant, Lindy, to help pick out colors, and the result has significantly brightened and beautified the two rooms where we spend most of our waking hours.\n\nWhen you undertake a project that takes this much time, you quickly realize that you have invited some strangers into your home for a lengthy stay.   Well, the guys David sent did not stay strangers for very long.  They were cheerful, friendly, and helpful to us.  They added, without cost, some features to the project at our request, even though these features were not in the original contract-- for example, installing a dimmer switch in the kitchen, replacing flood lights in our dinette area so they would match the color put out by our new kitchen lighting, cutting out the trim along one wall of our living room so our bookcase could lay flat against the wall, and installing wall outlets in our bookcase.  They cleaned up after themselves every day and hauled away their own trash.  When they moved furniture around to do some painting, they always put it back where it had been.  It got to where we enjoyed having the company at our house.  At the end of the job, we were glad it was completed, but we were sorry to see the guys leave.\n\nAll the work was done with great attention to detail.  They found and installed tile to match our existing kitchen backsplash tile.  They worked on our project every weekday for three weeks.  On some days, they worked on our cabinet doors and bookcase at their shop, but on the days when they did not come, David always called us to let us know they would not be there and what they would be doing that day.\n\nWe will certainly call on Lisenby Construction if we undertake new remodeling projects.

{"user_id": "106281876022532132920", "name": "Betty Pierce", "time": 1624154500227, "rating": 5.0, "text": "Some years ago we needed some significant waterproofing and structural repairs done in our basement home. We contacted a few different companies to provide an Inspection and estimate. After some discussion we decided\nOn a company that was not on the higher side of the estimates. We felt like the fix would be pretty much the same no matter who we chose\nAnd saving money was in our interest at the time..One company we called was a fairly well known local company A.F.S. We were familiar with them because they began here in Decatur\nSo we would see trucks around town. FYI,  I wanted you to know, we should\u2019ve called AFS from the start. Today I\u2019m here some 7 odd years later, after spending thousands of dollars with the low price alternative and my\nSump pump and drainage system doesn\u2019t work, our walls are blistering and cracking up, down and horizontally, water is seeping thru the wall cracks and the concrete blocks are shifting and cracking our exterior brick and interior block walls. I have limited mobility and couldn\u2019t go check on these things easily and things kept getting worse. Considering what we received from the lower priced company, we decided to call AFS to provide their opinion on our basement situation. At this point , the only thing working or effective was a dehumidifier. It was time to seek experts advice. We had previously used AFS in a limited capacity for our cracked pool deck and they performed that repair just fine and although that repair is not inexpensive,\nIt was much less and more quickly usable than any other options we looked at. So from there we felt we could allow them a chance to tell us (what )was happening and (why )was it happening . When the day came for the inspection, David Flamm , the inspector called our home in advance and let us know his arrival time and asked if we could sit for a few questions before beginning the inspection. He felt we would have something of value to help  determine the cause of the damage. We felt he was sincere and listened to what we had to say and even wrote down the answers. We watched as he went room to room with his big light and something like a laser . He was very thorough, and  took  pictures as he moved around the house.\nOne thing he did,  that most never do, is David removed his boots before walking on my clean floors. Not a big thing but it got my attention.\nAfter the inspection inside , he explained what he would be doing outside and that my husband\nWas welcome to tag along if he wanted, so he did. He was rather impressed with David\u2019s knowledge and ability to explain the plan of repair. After our experience with another company (who did almost nothing) and David\u2019s attitude and attention to our concerns, we were very relieved that we called AFS. He took pictures and put them on his laptop for us to clearly see the issues, he asked our opinion and waited for our response. Never did he act pushy or lacked any uncertainty about what he would do to help us. He allowed us to view video software of the repairs needed, and even priced the project as he went thru the videos. Needless to say,  we were very comfortable with Dave and could feel he really knew what the problems required. Before we had to ask, David explained AFS Warranty, Service and maintenance program and how they return and maintain the eguipment so we didn't have to worry. This was very helpful considering my physical limitations and my husband is very busy with work. We felt very reassured after spending a couple of hours with David Flamm, we had called the right company. AFS must invest a lot of time into the people that work for them, it was so smooth . We had no trouble connecting the dots. David explained the project review process they go they prior to arriving to our home and how the foreman on the job has already seen the project and all of the pictures as David and the foreman discuss the ins and outs of it. It seems every concern we had initially was addressed before we had to express it. AFS, should be the first and only call you make for your home today.\nWe are glad we did.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624291512896, "text": "Hello Betty!

They were very prompt and courteous.  We had a small problem that Nathan brought to my attention after he and his crew started the prep work in the area which resulted in them having to remove 2 additional (early 1930's) brick support columns and level the dirt foundation under them.  Had Nathan not brought the potential problem to my attention, even with the work they were doing, I might have had more collapse in that area in the future.  Now I won't have any concerns about that.  I was very impressed with how well these 3 men worked together and also independently while completing the job.  AFS has turned an old damp 1930's basement crawl space area into a bright, clean space my grandkids could play in at my house.  The crew cleanup in my yard was spot-on.  They even hauled off those brick columns for me.  I'm looking forward to the follow-up visit in about two months to see how much more lift they can get in my (had been) sagging floors.  There was some immediate improvement when they tightened all the floor jacks and after that new dehumidifier dries up my floor rafters for a few weeks we should see even more improvement.

It had to be stabilized or I was going to have to totally redo the carport.  I did not know who to contact but a friend had AFS do some foundation stabilization work for him. I asked him about AFS.  I had seen the TV ads but know that anyone can do a slick tv commercial.  It turns out, the friend was positively impressed with AFS on his project. So, I made an appointment for their rep to visit.  I was still a little skeptical.  The field rep arrived on time and looked at my issue.  He suggested their concrete stabilization product.  He described how it would work and be installed.  He was not at all pushy nor did he give me any slick sales pitch.  He knew about the product, how it was installed and what it could do.  I agreed to do the project with them and made a down payment on the project.  We scheduled the job and on the agreed upon day, the installation crew arrived.  They were a little later than initially planned BUT the office called to say they were running behind, so that was not an issue.  They were maybe 30 minutes later than planned. The installation guys checked over the carport and talked over their plans with me. Then they went straight to work. They were clean cut, totally nice people to have at my home with no smoking or foul language - just hard work! There was an obvious difference to the carport when they were through.  So, I really felt good about their work.  They also cleaned up any mess that they made (a little concrete dust) with the tools they brought to the job site.

Over the last 2 years, it has flooded during the heavy rains in January and February.  I did some research to evaluate this issue and decided to go with a reputable, established, and known company.  I was not disappointed.  Mr. David Flamm arrived at my house promptly for my initial appointment.  He was professional and personable.  After a few minutes of discussion, he understood my concerns and started his investigation.  Once he completed his investigation, he sat down my wife and I and went over his findings. His presentation of what could be done was easy to understand and follow along using the video clips on his computer. All seemed logical, but me, being the ever skeptic, asked many questions about how the system would work and why it seemed the water was infiltrating my living spaces after 7 years of no water. He answered all of my questions and his explanations made sense.  After it was all said and done, we had the Aquastop Control groundwater seepage system with Aquastop basement air system,  EZflow  tubing with the triple pump action installed.\nDay of installation:\nThe team showed up on time for the install lead by Nick.  It had been raining a lot AGAIN and i had my makeshift sump-pump system running to dewater the area where it was building up.  The team laid down plastic tarp so as to not get my finished basement dirty and commenced to working.  It took them 2 days to complete.  What a job. When they laid in the pump system and started the pumps, the water buildup that i had my makeshift system in for, drained and did not come back.  EUREKA!!  Since this system has been in place, we continue to get the storms and flooding but my basement/crawlspace remain dry.  The system works as described and projected.  I cannot thank Dave and his team from AFS enough.  Their professionalism and concern to provide a solution to my problem was genuine and their work is top of the line. Dave's evaluation of my needs and his concern to present me with different options was genuine and without company profit in mind. I highly recommend this company and team for any issues you may have in basement or crawlspace area.

Due to hydrostatic pressure my walls were caving in slightly. I don\u2019t remember the terminology  AFS uses but they came in and put what looks like a tarp over the walls.  It\u2019s to prevent moisture and mold buildup. Life time warranty. It might be working but since my walls are covered up I am only guessing it is. After I removed everything from the walls in the basement, yes, everything, including taking out my bathroom, they jackhammered around the edge of the walls about a one foot trench. AFS then put in place , what I call a gutter. Rocks were placed around this gutter along with a moisture barrier and then concrete poured on top. Supposedly, they put holes into each concrete block on my wall and place  a pipe that goes from block to gutter. As you know, these blocks have cylinders inside where water can build up. The purpose is for water to drain from block(my wall)into the gutter then it\u2019s to flow to corner of house where there is a sump pump.\n\nShort story is that it\u2019s been two years and no water has touched the sump pump. As you know the last two years have been like northwest Washington where we are getting tons of rain. Now I\u2019m having moisture, called efflorescence, coming up where they jackhammered. AFS came by several times and put a sealer on floor. Never worked. Had another man come by and look at system to see if water was flowing properly; it was. I spoke to one of the managers and he stated there was nothing else they could do. I thought about legal action but statue of limitations had expired. $13k pretty much wasted and I\u2019m left still trying to fix the problem.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1579289402562, "text": "Mr. Simmons,\n\nWe are sorry for your  frustration.

We found this out after we notified them we had a quote from another company.  This should throw up major \u201cred flags\u201d to anyone reading this. Why not give you their best price up front? Now read the rest if you would like.\n\nStay away from AFS if you plan on getting multiple quotes.  I LOVED everything they told me and was completely impressed by their upfront professionalism.  The representative came out, did a thorough inspection and gave us a detailed layout of what needed to be done.  Where things went bad was when it was discovered that we also had another company come out, providing comparable services for a moderately better price.  As a decent human, I felt it important to contact the AFS rep to inform him of our appreciation but we were going to go with a competitor. At that point he became a high-pressured salesman and became somewhat belligerent.  To top things off, we had filed a coverable insurance claim regarding a busted drain pipe and the insurance company contacted this AFS rep and the rep told them the problem was due to an issue that is well-known not coverable by insurance.  Had I not called the rep to inform him, man-to-man, of our decision and simply \u201cghosted\u201d him (a cowardly way of handling things), we wouldn\u2019t be in the predicament.  Through this behavior and revengeful tactics, he reassured us that AFS is not the type of company we want to take care of our home.  My wife and I are teachers and work on a limited budget...we would be silly to not request more than one estimate for a job this size.  A company such as this should realize that.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578440362389, "text": "Mr. Milam,\n\nWe appreciate your kind remarks regarding the professionalism of our inspector.  We do try to be extremely detailed and responsible with both our inspections and repair plans.  Obviously we are disappointed when a homeowner chooses to use another company, but always want folks to make a decision that they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nIt sounds like there was some confusion regarding a possible insurance claim that you filed.  When asked by homeowners whether a crawlspace scenario is covered by insurance, our standard reply is that \u2018it depends on your policy, it\u2019s best to contract your insurance provider\u2019.  While we\u2019re not an insurance company, the trend that we have seen is that acute issues like a plumbing leak may be covered, whereas issues that develop over time, like ground water seepage are typically the homeowner\u2019s responsibility \u2013 similar to hail damage to a roof vs a roof just wearing out.\n\nThe inspection photos of your crawl space showed a pattern of mud lines on multiple walls of your crawlspace.  This is consistent with a ground water seepage challenge and why our repair plan called for drainage and a sump pump in your crawl space.  If asked what was found in our inspection, our policy is just to be candid.  We can\u2019t really speak to causality, but just to current conditions noted.\n\nHope this clears up any misunderstanding and we wish you the best with your repairs."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621663b63fdbf9:0xecb0ee1e38d7cfea"}

When it rained the water would not drain properly in both of these locations.  AFS said that their injection program would fix both of these problems; in reality it was the start of making things much worse.  They drill a bunch of holes in the concrete and inject some material that is supposed to raise the concrete; unfortunately the whole concept is flawed.  They cannot control where this material goes as it is injected under the concrete and they are unable to correctly monitor the pressure as it goes in.  AS a result my walkway in back and my driveway ended up cracked and tilted in such a way that the problem was much worse; the water was now more directed towards my house.\nAFS tried to fix the driveway by cutting a 25 foot trench in my driveway and installing a drain; unfortunately this was also done incorrectly.  The slope of the drain did not allow the water to drain out, the drain was installed with large screws going into the drain pipe, which caught leaves creating a barrier.  Additionally, the cracks they created in the driveway and improper injection of the filler material caused my driveway to sag creating a lake that does not drain at all.\nAFS tried to fix the drainage problem made worse by their injection program in back by digging up part of the walkway and replacing the concrete; unfortunately, again they did not get it right.  They did not provide the proper slope to the new concrete and as a result the water make another lake immediately up against the side of my house.\nSo now I have worse drainage problems, my driveway looks like hell and as a result of the drainage problems the corner of my house at the garage is sagging.\nI would have been much better off if they had done nothing.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558126613083, "text": "Hello Mr. Ballard, we can certainly understand your frustrations.

What my Inspector did was gather just enough information about my crawlspace to fit into his sales pitch. It\u2019s probably best to do your own crawlspace inspection before you even call them out, because you may have to perform repairs before their crew comes out. They DO NOT employ plumbers, carpenters or electricians to handle possible crawlspace issues.

In accordance with the contract I was responsible for making sure there was power available in the crawlspace for the dehumidifier. When I go into the crawlspace to take care of this I see a wet spot from 15 feet away and realize I have a water leak. A closer look revealed I had water damage. I point blank asked that Inspector if he saw anything that required immediate attention and he said \u201cNo\u201d. There\u2019s no way he should have missed this. The \u201cInspector\u201d did come out and look at it and he did put me in touch with a carpenter, whom I did use, and I was able to get a plumber out quickly.

I\u2019ll give the Inspector a break here and say he may or may not have discovered this if he had performed the type of inspection I expected. This turned into yet another unexpected expense on top of the carpenter and plumber. It would have been nice if the Inspector had caught all of this.

So it was decided I would have the work done.\nOn the two days the pier crew arrived, the crew chief Javier greeted me and we discussed the work progress and what they were doing each day.  Javier was ready to explain anything I was unsure about, with a short discussion on my expectations he and his crew was ready to get started.

It was great to see a crew that was self starting and knew their job so it could be accomplished with little delay. The second day the crew members changed a bit, but still  Javier was the crew chief, and again they started work soon after they arrived without delay and some conversations occurred at times to make sure what they were doing was the right way, because the situation of this repair was a little unusual, but they adapted to keep the work on time and with a professional attitude.\nThe third day the poly crew chief,  Dendy and crew arrived on time and immediately Dendy greeted me and explained what they were here for and ask to be shown the work area.  We discussed what he was going to do and how it would be accomplished and without delay, they got started preparing for the job of the day. They were always willing to explain the procedure and the expected results, and also how they would attempt to prevent any unwanted results.\nI want to commend all the personnel for their excellent work and their professionalism and accepting my sometimes unneeded suggestions and allowing me to express myself.\nThank you AFS for having happy crews, apparently they like working for AFS and proudly say so with a strong sense of belonging to a company who apparently cares about their employees.\n\nRobert Hendrix\nA  Satisfied Customer.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509053963738, "text": "Mr. Hendrix, we greatly appreciate your feedback, as well as your trust in AFS to complete your repair project!

I've have tried calling their sales office, I was told to call corporate, I called corporate and got voicemail.\n\nMy house is about 4 years old.  Well out of warranty.  But, most of the poor workmanship appears after the warranty period has ended.  My master bath and entrance to our master bedroom has severe structural problems.  The cracks you see have been re-plastered and painted more than once.  Forget about doors closing properly.  The doors have been trimmed to such an extent that a new door will be required for the bedroom.  The framing issues you may have will not be covered by your warranty and will not appear until a few years after you own your home.  Once they do, you will find yourself spending a lot of money to repair.\n\nIf framing were the only issue, I probably would not write the review.  I never do this kind of thing.  But the electrical was done so poorly that it nearly burned the house down.  The left exposes copper to aluminum high voltage line exposed in a junction box.  The result was blowing out the double oven's control panel.  This resulted in an expensive repair to the ovens, but could have easily resulted in a fire.   Again-- the kind of thing that happens well after your warranty period has expired.\n\nThe problem I have with Woodland, is that their \"quality\" is only skin deep.  They have a great marketing staff, but once your in your house and a year has passed you are on your own to deal with the poor workmanship that lies just below the surface.  No builder is perfect.  But, it would be nice if they built to code.  I have more pictures if you are interested.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT8zwmpAC3GkSnyz5fh7pHe6nft9vFSBqVFrbz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNdMsaikoMSIPpj8V7A3YgEQdultklz5NkCyiN=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9IJry-J1cEmt8J3SaY1us6WX50ZBCBtMjryXr=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF18tSq8ZTFuuuPef1xabDX0zFOAP3Pts6KJxW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626897a1fd8d25:0x85114f992ebfd966"}

The sub-contractors don\u2019t keep up with their warranty repairs and Woodland doesn\u2019t follow-up with you after closing unless you are constantly in contact with them. Check my review of Custom Interior Trim to see just how their subs act and treat customers.\n\nTheir warranty team is an absolute joke. They don\u2019t follow-up, they don\u2019t coordinate, and if you aren\u2019t keeping them in line, they just let your items slide off the radar.\n\nThey have shown a complete lack of professionalism ever since we closed. I will admit, we love the house itself. It\u2019s good quality, the design process was fun, and we felt like the options they had to choose from were exactly in line with what we wanted, but the worst mistake I ever made was trusting that they would continue their great service after having closed on the house. If you don\u2019t listen to anything else, just hear me when I say do NOT let them close on your house until they finish everything. It has truly been bad enough that I regret ever choosing them as a builder, no matter how much we do like the house itself.\n\nAnd again, if I\u2019m being completely honest, the staff that they have are nice people. I mean I have legitimately enjoyed dealing with most of their staff, but I\u2019ve also had to do their job for them. I have to do all of the follow-up to make sure people are showing up to do their warranty repairs. I\u2019ve had to coordinate with the warranty department and the subs to make sure they had all of the correction items listed.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting dealing with Woodland and their lack of support for Warranty customers. I\u2019ve told them this multiple times, but if they would put just as much care into how they treat and deal with Warranty customers as they do with new customers still in the building process, they would be a nearly flawless business. Until then, they deserve this negative review and more. I\u2019ve spoken with multiple people in my neighborhood who can corroborate this story and would say the same thing themselves. We have warned people we know away from Woodland specifically because of this and away from some of the specific sub contractors they use. Horrible customer service, dismal professionalism, and a demeanor that says \u201cyou as a customer don\u2019t matter to us as much as the new build customers.\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617991364735, "text": "Blake,\n\nThank you for the kind words regarding your home building experience with Woodland Homes. We are happy to hear that you had a fun experience and enjoyed our process of building. Next, we would like to say that we understand your frustrations with warranty. We are in fact struggling with time lines and subcontractors. At this time North Alabama and surrounding areas are experiencing a housing boom. This combined with the struggles of building a product in the midst\u2019s of a global pandemic have made it difficult to obtain products for some of our customers warranty requests.\n\nIt is also difficult to keep subs motivated when they have so much work to choose from in front of them. This is just the honest truth, and the reality of the world we are living in.  That said we understand it is frustrating to wait on your items to be completed. While it may take us a little longer to complete a warranty item we are getting to all of our customers and completing their warranty requests. In fact, we have even extended specific warrantable items past the agreed upon 1 year term in order to ensure our customers are happy, and have their items completed .\n\nSince we don\u2019t know your full name there is no way to reach out directly. We would encourage you to call your onsite sales person and get them involved to assist you, or even call our corporate office and ask for the president of the company. He will be happy to work directly with you."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626897a1fd8d25:0x85114f992ebfd966"}

The personnel in the home office were welcoming and professional. During the build I hired a home inspector who found major errors with the home. This information was relayed to the site manager and many of the errors were overlooked and I\u2019m still dealing with them. Upon walking through my home I found basic issues with the craftsmanship that should\u2019ve been addressed by the site manager, if he had completed a walk thru of the home. Once the home was complete a final walk thru was scheduled. I found the same issues as the last walk thru. At this point, if you don\u2019t address the problem it\u2019s often overlooked. I refused to sign for the keys. As a buyer I felt rushed to sign for the keys to the home, that wasn\u2019t ready. I was promised the issues would be addressed in a timely manner, \u201cI\u2019M STILL WAITING\u201d. I still have a page of outstanding issues with my home. As a premier builder I expected more. The subcontractors provided poor quality of work. No disrespect, but the attention to detail lacked, for my home. I hope no one has to go through what I did. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s due to the number of homes Woodland is trying to build or is this the standard issue with Woodland across the board. I didn\u2019t want to come off as a complainer, so I asked around my neighborhood and many of us shared the same problems. This is not to bash Woodland. The homes, cosmetically looks great, I think more effort needs to be made to build a better quality home for the price and oversight of the subcontractors is a must. If this doesn\u2019t happen hold the site manager accountable. The warranty department shouldn\u2019t make people feel like they are the problem. The subcontractors need to do their job and provide a quality product. If I had to do it all again I would definitely ask around the neighborhood where I\u2019m buying and meet one on one with the builder.

It actually defies logic that I could desire so much to live there, be impressed with what I saw, and have the experiences I have had. Maybe it is coincidence but I don\u2019t think so. I will simply state what happened and let the reader decide. I have seriously looked at Woodland homes 4 times. The first experience was positive but I was afraid of the road in and out of the area so I decided not to buy. The last 3 times I had resolved that fear and wanted to purchase a house from Woodland homes. The first of these three, I spoke with an associate. He showed me a lot and gave me a price for a home on the lot. He said we had to see his boss. I did so and she literally panicked. She said he gave me the wrong price. I said ok and left. The second of these 3 times, Woodland homes sent me an email with an advertisement for a house already built. It was priced in the range we were looking for. We made an appointment with the aforementioned realtor and spent 30 minutes looking at the home. It had one feature we did not like but we were about to make an offer when she said oh no, this house has been sold. She added, but we can build you one like it on another lot. We spent a couple of hours looking at lots and found 3 we liked. She said she would send us the prices on all three. The result was that the lot we wanted was not available for the house we wanted to build on it and the other two had prices that were 40 to 50 thousand dollars more than the one we looked at. Not exactly the same price...The last time my wife met with a different realtor and got prices for several models one of which was built and the other almost completed. You have probably guessed what happened. I showed up with the checkbook only to find that all of the homes with quoted prices were much higher than documented on the plans provided to my wife. The one we really wanted was about $70,000 more. The other home already built was about 40,000 dollars more than documented on the plans.We left and will not return. The neighborhood looks great and maybe our experience is some kind of odd anomaly. Just wanted to share it.

However, if you are looking for top quality and attention to detail, you would be better off with another builder. They build homes quickly - maybe too quickly as evidenced by some of the problems we have experienced.  After living in our home for two years, a light switch in our dining room which was not in use at the time suddenly sparked and popped and caused a breaker to blow.  I called an electrician who discovered that the wiring was barely connected which caused arcing and sparking.  He then checked a few more light switches and outlets to find that about half of them were loose and sloppily constructed.  I ended up paying for the electrician to inspect every light switch and electrical plug in my home. I have also had to replace wiring in the electrical box because of a humming noise.\nWhen you build a home with Woodland, they schedule you for a one day marathon of dealing with the contract staff and their design team.  You must be prepared to make ALL decisions in one day.  Their design center has a limited number of choices and you have no time to research products. Don't assume that they offer quality products, either.  Price Pfister products were their plumbing choice at the time I built my home. Huge mistake.  If I had known how crappy this brand was, I would have insisted on Delta products. That goes for wood floors also.  I chose a \"premium\" product for an additional cost only to find after it started denting and scratching immediately that it was made out of a soft eucalyptus based engineered wood.  I have already replaced half of it with a nice Hickory engineered wood that has held up beautifully- even in high traffic.\nI was not happy with either their ceramic tile selection or carpet choices but had no option other than to pick what I disliked the least.  Apparently, most of my neighbors did the same because we all have the same back splash.  I have already replaced carpeting in my bedroom because of poor wear.\nThis is not the first home that I have had built so it is not like I was expecting perfection.

We paid for it months before it was installed -- keep this fun fact in the back of your mind -- and seemed super easy and hassle free. Walked in the store, told the salesman we were looking for the largest above ground pool we could get that would be about 5 feet deep. He was super helpful, because we also admitted we knew nothing about the specifics, dimensions, or details; just what we wanted. We ordered and paid for a 27 foot round, 52 in walled, extended liner package.  We were also, originally,  getting a hot tub.  However 2 months after the purchase we found out we were having a baby, so we opted out of the hot tub, and stayed with just the pool.  3 months after that, pool installers brought the pool and did their thing.  My wife was concerned when they finished because the over lap liner was 6 inches from the ground in places, but they convinced  her that was what an overlap liner was supposed to look like. It took her about 3 weeks to actually get in the pool (when it was finally warm enough) and then she just cried. It was 3 and a half feet deep at its highest point. She drove her very large, pregnant self down to johnson pools and spoke with the original salesman.  He very shortly told her they have no affiliation with the installers, and there was nothing Johnson Pools could do to make it right, because it wasn't their fault.   Wife said her blood pressure got so high she thought she was going to have the baby at their store. Fast forward to the end of the first summer -- when we ordered a winter cover (obviously from a different place, the last time to step foot in the showroom she almost birthed a baby on their floor and swore them off for good)  we learned it was a 24' pool. \ud83d\ude32. Now, here we are, over a decade later, ready to replace the liner and find out THE WALLS ARE 48 inches tall. How much did we over pay for what we have?!! I'm still disgusted with the whole thing,  and have gotten in the pool MAYBE 5 times in 10 years.  My wife says every year we open the pool and the kids are taller she just gets angry all over again.

The Service rep said no worries she would take care of it ASAP get back to me on delivery... several days went by and no call. I contacted her again and stressed we were having a Birthday party and needed the pool up and running. She promised to get back to me. I called her two days later... She isn\u2019t there has gone on a mission with her parents. So I start all over with someone else. He calls me back! It gets delivered early! Yeah we are going to have time to get it up and running and won\u2019t have to have go with plan B for the birthday girl. The installers are great guys and get the new liner installed! Yeah!! They leave and we start filling! It now Saturday and we have lost two months of Pool time! We go get salt to get this thing going... Monday I call her back and let her know we are looking good and ask about the chemicals and the expense. I explained we had already gotten salt. No worries she says, bring in a sample we will get you what you need and give you credit. Ok that seems fair. I take a sample down, they give me algaecide and other chemicals, When I go to check out hey have to get her since I should be credited.  She has the cashier comp the stuff, I ask her what about the salt I have already purchased? She says she will give us store credit for the qty we bought. Ok that works for me!  Fast forward to last week. I go to the shop and get algaecide and shock to get the pool up and running for the year. I explained I should have a credit and the tech finds my account so he goes to talk to her... a few minutes later they come back. She bellows at me \u201cYou don\u2019t have any credit with us!
