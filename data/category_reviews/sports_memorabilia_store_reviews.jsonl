Very reasonably priced, unlike some of the other boutiques around. They were making way for football season, with cute clothes and accessories for Alabama and Auburn fans, alike. They had great deals on jewelry and accessories like sunglasses. The owner was very friendly, and even offered me a quiet space for my fussy baby. She even had a little room set up with a chair and wooden changing station for breastfeeding and changing babies. She even had spare disposable diapers stocked. That was so thoughtful. I will definitely be going back, and will add photos next time. This place is worth checking out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cbc0be85a9f5:0x6cc5cb494559b4a"}
