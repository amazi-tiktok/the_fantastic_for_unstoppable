I\u2019ve only had the car 5 months and here goes the motor just gone out..\n\nwhen we recall all the problems this car had and I was fixing it every time something happen the mechanic and I agreed that it\u2019s been a problem with the motor he also told me Chevy Cruze\u2019s had a recall on their motor!!\nThe dealership never told me this! The mechanic did , now here iam 2 week later without a car , a rental , no communication from the dealership or warranty company just nothing I\u2019m paying to get my car looked at  I\u2019m missing work and I have to do everything alone every time I call GENE HE TELLS ME TO CALL TROY!! Finally I called TROY just wanting to get help with my car getting fixed by this 2 year warranty i supposed to have  because once I sent it to real good mechanic they told him I didn\u2019t have a warranty!! That  I was supposed to have & they don\u2019t know anything!! I had to find the warranty number alone and when I get Troy on the phone he\u2019s \u201csick with COVID-19\u201d so I guess that means hang up in my face because he\u2019s not feeling well BUT NEITHER AM I!! I\u2019m a 21 year old women who pays her bills on time and have to get to work!!  I really need my car due to me having two jobs and was responsible for getting myself to work. I feel like I bought a lemon!! Well proofs in the pudding my advice to upcoming buyers... TAKE A MECHANIC AND LET HIM TEST DRIVE IT !! It\u2019s only one person at Langston motors that tried to help me during this process and that\u2019s Troy daughters she\u2019s a angle and I thank you so Much for trying to do what you can to help me!!! I really appreciate you the most!! Thanks for everything!\n\nSincerely, A angry black women.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888925d27e10c40b:0xcd531219c197cc25"}

After speaking with Devon at length, we ended up buying the Q5 same day.\n\nDevon simply makes you feel good.  You sense his honesty right up front and there were no questions he couldn't answer.  We truly felt we were in extremely competant hands.\n\nThank you to Devon, the auto group, and for making it easy to jump the Land Rover ship and become a member of the Audi family.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4dcbea473dff:0xc79a4b79a21641d6"}

We have been exhaustively searching online and at local dealer lots for a late-model mini-van, low-mileage at a competitive price.\n\nIn doing so, we honed in on the year, make and model, as well as the accessories we wanted.  And our lengthy search also gave us a good feel for the price that the market was asking for, for a well-maintained Sienna.\n\nSo when Dylan Freeman met us on the lot to answer any questions, we were ready to dig into the details in short order.  He was much more than helpful and we immediately felt at ease as he shared his insights into this particular vehicle and how the pre-owned car market worked.  He was never pushy and gave us the space to ask honest questions we had accumulated in our research.\n\nWe opted for a fair price on our trade-in SUV and after a brief ride in the Toyota, we were coached through the loan process with Jason Grier's help.  HSTM staff were professional and respectful, friendly and helpful, and offered a quality used car for a very fair price.\n\nMany thanks to Hoover Southtown Motors for a great find and a smooth transition into our new van.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a3809e4193:0xbf0129d3d8be45bc"}

They have also been there for us when we were blessed and wanted a nicer vehicle.

Their people are always there for us even helping us with a car we didn\u2019t purchase from them.  Through our first purchase knowing nothing about Southtown to just yesterday when purchased another car from them there is no finer dealer in Birmingham.\n\nYour looking for someone you can trust and know that they are looking out for you when it comes to used cars.

One day I, just googled the type of car I wanted and the year and car guru showed me different options. I saw the car I wanted and price was great! Therefore, I inquired about the car and encountered David Cooper. Nice person. I went down to view the car and test drive as well all went perfect. However, they should really watch what they say and how they say it. The day I went back to purchase, it was stated by David C. they found an extra key, ( that made me wonder suppose it may have went another way but, sometimes used cars come with two keys and sometimes not its gamble.) I have worked at a dealership before, and I know how sales representatives do (it is optional they can give you both sets, but they really do not have to). I over heard him say since I paid cash he is going to let me have the other key, but I didn\u2019t say a word about it because it is what it is. When I got to the final stage and had to do paper work I forgot the young man name, but he used a very horrible analogy when he got to the repossession page. The car I purchased was decent thank god had a few issues before I left. The tire sensor would not go off come to find out there was a nail in the tire it was in there before I left Birmingham and the blend door had gotten stuck on the passenger side but they agreed to fix it. My advice to others do your background check and research and when buying a used car pay attention to small and big detail. Overall, everything else went smooth. My name will not be in your system as N. Richardson it will be listed as N. Walker.\n\nI purchase a used vehicle from this place in February and it\u2019s only been two months for me, but now I have to replace brakes, rotors, 2 tie rod ends, and I had to purchase a spare tire. I know the vehicle is used and all, but at least check the cars out completely before selling them. I just thank GOD those tie rods didn\u2019t come apart on me while driving. I didn\u2019t get to go a good test drive so I couldn\u2019t really get the feel of the car. Overall motor wise the car is good. Guys just please check more into the vehicles used or not y\u2019all selling cars and not thinking completely about safety. God was truely with me.\n\n(05/06/2020)-*Just an update they did not even try to reach out to me after posting that review they don't care, just wanted to reach their quota and get a commission.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a3809e4193:0xbf0129d3d8be45bc"}

By \"looking at it,\" they just ripped my CD out and ruined the CD without fixing anything.  Then I noticed when I was towing a trailer, something was seriously wrong.  I originally told them it was a transmission issue or engine misfire.  Long story short, they \"can't find the problem\" and 6 months later I'm still stuck with a broken truck.  They always acted like they were on my side, but this dealership is nothing but a group of crooks.  I dealt with everyone trying to get it straightened out.

They found one and it was nothing like what I wanted, so I passed and they told me I could look for one on my own and they would check into it.  I found about 10 and never got a reply from them.  They put around 3k miles on it.  And one day I went to pick it up and it had a broken side view mirror.  They said \"Wow.  Didn't even notice that.\" and it took them nearly two months to fix it.

Our car at the time had transmission issues and due to poor credit we came to The Driving Factor because of their decent ratings on Google. We bought a 2008 Chrysler Town and Country.  I rarely drove it as my car was being constantly fixed,  and only used it as a backup.  I owned this van for 3 months and didn't even put enough miles on it to get an oil change.  Then one night,  I wake up to the police pounding on my door at 2am. Why were they pounding,  you ask? Because the minivan in my driveway had burst into flames.  The reason? Shoddy electrical shorted out and caused a fire near the gas tank.\n\nI lost valuable camera equipment and a vehicle I had a 375 a month payment on.  To top it off this happened around the time my cars transmission went completely.\n\nWe went to TDF. They informed us there was no warranty for the electrical system.  They would,  however,  \"kindly\" give us a loaner car to drive until the insurance finished their claim on the van.\n\nThe loaner was an old Impala that absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke and was constantly overheating and breaking down.  When my husband complained,  the older lady told him we should be thankful to have a loaner vehicle at all because that's not something they do.  They also wanted us to continue making the $375 a month payments on a minivan that was burnt to a crisp.\n\nThere were no apologies.  When the insurance claim was finished they said we still owed $2000 (they were making us pay all the interest on top of what the van cost) and in order to get another vehicle,  we would have to pay that $2000 on top of a down payment.  They literally sold us a POS and then wouldn't work with us at all.  Great business practice!\n\nWe took our business to High Country Toyota and got a minivan that lasted 3 years ( and a shorter loan of 18 months vs the 3.5 years Driving Factor had us roped into). I went back to High Country when that van needed to be replaced and bought myself a brand new Corolla.\n\nLong story short,  don't go here,  ever.  Not only did I get sold a Lemon but I had to replace $5000 of camera equipment that was burned up inside the van, and this dealership did not care one bit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889f917f3a2026b:0x6d970a9fce4b1299"}
