I was being told that I\u2019d have to work a few more years by every lender I spoke to. It took me 10 months of lender hopping to find home town lenders. I closed about 30 days later with a conventional loan that I was told was impossible to get by other lenders.

Also their underwriters are in house, so there are less excuses for stuff not getting done, it\u2019s not some slimy credit union **STAY AWAY FROM CREDIT UNIONS FOR LOANS** credit unions are professional time wasters, if you are batting a thousand, they will keep you on the hook then tell you that you don\u2019t qualify.\n\nAnyways, Home town lenders is the way to go. They have set a new standard for a lender to me.

However, in short, if you value your time and sanity, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GET A MORTGAGE FROM INTERLINC.\n\nOur loan officer was Jerry Brown, referred to us by our realtor.  Jerry believes that he is an excellent communicator, which could not be further from the truth.  Additionally, he has no interest in listening to his customers -- when he interrupted me on the phone (which was a frequent occurrence) and I interrupted back to say, politely but firmly, \"Jerry, do not interrupt me,\" he immediately HUNG UP THE PHONE on me.  He then emailed me to say that he \"would not allow\" me to speak to him like that and that all further business would need to be conducted via email.  This, because I spoke up to tell him that I was not finished speaking and wanted my concerns heard before he blew them off again.  There is truly no excuse for hanging up on a customer, in my book.\n\nWhen the time came to transfer us to a closing officer, Jerry did not introduce us, tell us what was happening, or in any way orient us to the situation -- which, again, was typical for our experience.  Once the closing officer took over, Jerry just stopped answering emails.  At no point did we really have any idea what was going on, what was next, and where we were in the process.  To be told that \"your approval is on my desk\" and then asked for more documents and verification does not make sense.  Either we are approved, so we are done, or we are not, and further information is needed.  Once again, Jerry showed no interest in listening to my concern and confusion as to where we were in the process.\n\nIssues with Jerry aside, the fact that we were doing a \"mail away\" closing -- since we obviously could not travel 900 miles just to sign some documents -- seemed to present a major problem for Interlinc.  We were not informed as to the timing of the process, and though everyone involved knew when we were signing the GIANT stack of documents, it was only almost a week after the closing that we were informed that, due to federal regulations, we would have to re-sign the ENTIRE PACKAGE (some 92 pages) with a new date.  Once again, communication among various Interlinc employees was atrocious, as we were essentially bounced around like a hot potato, never knowing who was supposed to be organizing things for us.\n\nIn fact, our experience was so poor that I emailed a complaint to, among others, the CEO, requesting a refund of some of the absolutely ridiculous fees (1% origination fee, plus another $1,000+ in additional garbage).  An attorney for Interlinc contacted us, investigated the situation (whatever that means), and promptly issued us a check for the amount we requested.  The fact that we received that refund tells me that they know how badly they screwed up...and yet, we then had to deal with the date issue I mentioned above, with more of the same bad communication.  Clearly, they did not actually LEARN from their mistakes with us.\n\nSo if you want to, like me, suffer physical anxiety at every email and phone call, worry about approval on a \"slam dunk mortgage,\" and generally undergo a severe amount of stress because, for instance, you keep thinking your mortgage is DONE, and aren't you just wrong as heck, please, get a mortgage from Interlinc.  Otherwise, take my advice and stay as far away as possible from this company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aad3ea036f:0x699712e10636db4c"}

With this group, you're not simply numbers or bank account transactions on a spreadsheet. Josh Winn & his team have set the bar - much higher in fact than I could have imagined through the process. Lenders don't have a role at the the table on closing day and with the busyness of the peak real estate season, I was floored when Josh walked through the door.

They made what was such a frustrating process, into an extremely easy and efficient process.\nI was working with another local lender for months and getting nowhere. They weren\u2019t making any effort to make me or my home buying experience a priority and I missed out on a handful of houses that I\u2019d loved to have put offers on because they wouldn\u2019t get back to me with pre approval letters or actual numbers of what I qualified for. When the numbers finally did come through, I would update them with promotions at work and pay increases which somehow made my amount of money drop by $70,000. When brought to their attention, they simply told me that there was nothing they could do because I was a single father paying child support and the only option I had was to somehow workout a deal with my ex wife where I was paying her off the books and there was no record of me having to pay child support. Obviously that was nowhere close to being an option. We wasted 6 months with this company and finally decided to go another direction. Because I was using the VA loan, my realtor suggested I contact Joe Meadow and said he had a good reputation in the community for working with veterans. I thank God I did. Literally from the first phone call, he put me at ease and promised to take care of me. He followed through with that promise and within 3 days of working with him and his team, they had a pre approval letter in my hand for a much more realistic number that would allow me to get into a nice home in a good neighborhood so I could feel that my child and family will be safe and taken care of. I am sure Joe takes care of all of his customers but guys, if you are veterans who are using the VA loan, trust me and go with Joe and Kristi. They will work their tails off for you and you don\u2019t have to worry about tracking them down or having to leave a bunch of messages begging for them to call you back. The process was so much more efficient and productive with them. This was the 4th house I\u2019ve bought and by far the best service from a lender out of all of them.

My fianc\u00e9 and I were first time home buyers and after doing our research we decided to try TJC. Danielle was the person who helped us and from the bat I had an uneasy feeling. Should have walked away then. For starters, she kept getting our application information wrong. We were given a different explanation anytime we spoke to her about what numbers to expect. She would repeatedly say things like, \"going to call you at 2:00\" and would either a) call at 10 at night or b) not call at all. She texted everything. Which I normally would be fine with but with it being such confidential info I felt like it was super unprofessional. The day that we got our pre approval letter she kept telling me that we would not qualify for the particular one we were going for, I asked why because she had been telling us we were approved for 3 weeks. She called my fianc\u00e9 by the wrong name and I corrected her in the next email and she then informed me that she had sent me the wrong information and that we were approved. She had not only gotten me confused with someone else but she had sent us someone else's information! I then knew that persons name, financial information, had their application, etc. She immediately texted me and said something along the lines of \"omg like so sorry, someone else has a similar name as you please disregard those emails\" And then proceeded to tell me WHY these people were being denied, telling me even more information about their finances. I was so thrown off. She begged for us to still use them for our mortgage and like a dummy I said ok. Only because we were so far into this. I told her my concerns of her never answering my calls, getting us confused with other applicants, etc and she promised to do right. FOOLISH ME. So we find a house on a Saturday, very competitive house. We decided to put an offer down on Sunday. I called Danielle on Saturday to tell her we would need some info for our realtor to finish our offer letter the following morning. After HOURS she texts me (of course, no call back) and was said she would get right on it. Well we go to our realtors office the next morning and she tells me that she tried contacting Danielle three times, all in different forms of communication and never heard back. We went on a limb and used another mortgage lender that we had been recommended from friends and she did everything for us from start to finish in about 20 minutes. I called, texted, and emailed Danielle that we were not using them anymore and why. Danielle texted our realtor that next WEDNESDAY our information that we requested that Saturday. She ignored my messages of us saying we were giving them the boot. Had we stayed with TJC we would have lost our house that we were wanting. Danielle Charlnoes was easily the most unprofessional person I have EVER worked with and I am so thankful we went a different route.

As far as employment goes, most applicants are examined on a case-by-case basis, and employment is only one piece of the total borrower evaluation. Lenders will look at how long you've been employed, the types of jobs you held and how many periods of unemployment are in your history. That being said, the \"gold standard\" of employment for lenders is 2 years of stable, reliable, full-time employment.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your frustration. Our teams are passionate about helping veterans and service members use their hard-earned benefit, and we are sorry that we were unable to provide financing.
