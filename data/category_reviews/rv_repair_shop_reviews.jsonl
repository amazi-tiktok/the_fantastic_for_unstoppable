Although I had towing insurance,they said I had to come pay a hundred and fifty dollars first.\nHere i was with no,vehicle,beat up and bruised up by wreck.\nI told them I couldn't tell i could get a way.

That's another seventy five dollars.\nI wait all day for delivery.\nI call towing company around four.\nThe lady said my truck is on the way.\nI walk out to end of my drive and see the tow truck with my truck coming my way.\nI only live a short ways down. The road is a dirt road with some low places.\nBut pretty solid. A little water in some.\nBut drivable without getting stuck. Just yesterday I seen a rollback come through easy.\nThe lady driver stopped about fifty yards before my drive. I kept motioning for her to come on.\nShe set there for like twenty minuts.\nI'm standing there with a badly injured leg .\nI call the office. The lady there says the driver is refusing to drive to my yard because of fear of getting stuck.\nI tell the lady the holes aren't deep, its not soft. It's full of cement.\nThe driver still refuses.\nThen she backs up into my neighbors yard. She sets there. I walked down there. The blond rolls down window and started talking 90 miles an hour. I say,hun..Please just listen. I know this road. I promise sweety,you won't get stuck.

The lady says the driver isn't gonna take it to my yard.\nShe also said they were bringing the truck back and would have to wait tell the road was better.\nThats when I lost all patents.\nI told the driver,hell no your not. Drop it right here. I payed to have it delivered to my place  and you are refusing to deliver it. My place is right there.\nThats my property,I need it and your not leaving with it. The bill is payed and you are not holding up your end of the agreement  !\nShe says,the bill isn't payed. I said, oh hell yes it is. I was standing there when my insurance agent agreed to it ,plus the hundred and fifty I payed.\nShe got all cocky and rolled the window up.\nI stood there waiting for my truck to be unloaded in someone else's yard. Not knowing how to get it to mine..\nAfter about five minuts she got out running her mouth threatening to leave with it.\nI dial 911. She shut up.\nThen while she unloaded it,she in a smart attitude said,I bet your not gonna sign the delivery paper too.\nI told,her, yes,ill sign it because unlike you I try to do what's right.\nShe dropped the truck. I went checking my truck waiting to sign. She got in the tow truck and left.\nNow I'm hurting bad. My BP is up ,I can barley walk and don't know how ill get my truck out of these peoples yard into mine.\nAfter about an hour of talking to people.

I gave them the verbal to proceed and they called back an hour and half later to tell me that their original diagnosis was incorrect and that they found the problem.  A beach mouse/rodent chewed the fuel line to one of the cylinders and the bill would be $136 parts and labor.

I was told 89 cents a lbs and that I should have a 20 or 30 lbs tank on my RV. I should have known better than to choose Bankston at this time since the manager on the phone acted like it was such a hassle to give me the total price for both tanks. (After all the trouble he went through for the total.) I was told it was 19.28 for a 20lbs tank and 28.32 for a 30lbs tank. Which sounds reasonable, so I didn't bother to check anywhere else in town. When I arrived today, I was greeted by a professionally dressed man asking if I needed any help. I responded I need to get my propane tank filled and to get my brakes checked. I then pulled around to get my tank filled and was told it would be next week before they could get to my brakes. No big deal I thought. so I go inside to pay and the total came to 53 and some change. I confronted him about the quote I was gave over the phone and he immediately got defensive and started to explain why I was being charged more. Since I was interested in doing more business with them with my brake problem, you would assume that he would do what was necessary to make things right. He might have took a small loss on the propane but would have simply made it up in the outstanding labor charges. When you quote someone a price you stick with that price to make your customer feel valued. I really felt like I was nothing but in the way and a hassle to them as soon as I pulled onto the lot. Bankston Motor homes is less than a mile from my house. However I will make the drive to Coldwater RV center in Muscle shoals for any future service or maintenance I need for my RV. Last time I was there before I made my RV purchase they were very helpful and took the time that was needed to explain to me the different types of water systems I Inquired about and what would better suit my needs.

I live in Nashville TN and my search for an RV took me to Bankston Motor Homes of Warrior, Alabama!  While there is a Bankston Motor Homes in Nashville I'm thankful to have met and did business with the great folks in Warrior.  I'd make that journey 1,000 times over!  Daryl, Janet, Johnny, and Paul are the most caring, thoughtful, and thorough people I have encountered in a long time, even well after the sell!  This was my very first RV purchase and Johnny spent hours with me going over every detail of my new RV.  Johnny made recommendations on proper maintenance and intervals in order to enjoy my purchase for years to come.  Johnny and Paul made sure all systems on my RV were operational and performing optimally.\n\nUnfortunately, when I got my RV hooked up and went to pull off the lot I had some mechanical issues on my truck.  Johnny was there to help me get turned around and back on the lot.  Being late in the evening and after closing they allowed me to set up my RV on the lot and spend the night until I could get a tow truck the next morning and find a rental truck to pull my RV home.  Johnny was very helpful during the whole ordeal.  They made sure I had the necessities I needed to get through the night.  The next morning Johnny came to me and offered to take me to get breakfast if I wanted.  Daryl personally stopped what he was doing to give me a ride to pick up my rental truck.\n\nThe entire experience at Bankston Motor Homes of Warrior was top notch!  I left feeling like family.  I left the lot to go spend the weekend camping to break in my new RV.  Johnny called me Sunday evening to check on me and make sure I made it home safe and that I didn't have any issues with my RV.\n\nI cannot say thank you enough, nor say enough good things about these folks!  Daryl, Janet, Johnny and Paul I am truly thankful for a great experience!

We ended up buying what Daryl called a mom and pops camper because it was just me and my wife that would be using it. Any time I need something for my RV, Daryl has always taken care of me in an honest way. I recently needed some work done on my RV and Johnny in service got me fixed up in a week and the price on parts and labor was more than fair.

I tried to buy from this dealership, had my financing in order, drove two hours to the dealership.

I live in a RV full time to travel for work.  I am very familiar with the maintenance and  operation of a RV.  I even accepted they wanted to keep the RV for a few days to make sure everything worked properly.  They still would not sit down and complete the paperwork with me but wanted me to give them a down payment.\nFYI then person who walks into your dealership is your CUSTOMER.  You are not doing them a favor to sell them a RV. When I asked about ordering a different RV,  which was the RV I really wanted they said oh it will take 6 weeks.  in fact they had two coming within the following two weeks.  They would not even discuss with me ordering one for me.\n\nBUT I went to BAMA RV in Dothan Al.

We have set in place a very strict set of Company Policies that we follow to ensure each and every customer receives a camper that has been  thru our Service Department for a complete pre delivery inspection which consist of more than 75 items, including appliance checks, plumbing checks, electrical checks, sealant checks, proper slide out operations, installing a 12 volt battery and many more in depth inspections. This takes the better part of the day but insures that the customer can leave with confidence that everything is in working order. ( the prospective buyer  does not have the option to waive the inspection, it is required by the Manufacturer and Paradise RV Sales) We also like to walk thru the camper with the customer  after the pre delivery inspection to make sure the customer is satisfied before departing with their new camper.  ( this ensures that the customer has no surprises when they get home) As with any business we ask for earnest money to engage into a transaction and start the process, taking the camper off the market for sale, doing a pre delivery inspection and ordering Loan Contracts from a Bank. If  a prospective buyer refuses to sign an agreement to purchase with a minimum deposit for earnest money then we cannot move forward with a purchase.As a Company whose goal is Customer Satisfaction we Reserve The Right Not To Sale to any Prospective Buyer that Refuse to abide by our Company Policies.\nSo to all of our Customers and Non Customers Paradise RV Sales would like to take this opportunity to wish  you good luck in all of your camping adventures."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046c6bd8ab1b:0x11963b5991c52291"}

A HOLE in the shower! They didn't even do the work on the sway bar/tow area, stating, \"Uh, I didn't know what to do, so I didn't do anything.\" But, of course we had to pay for whatever labor cost they assigned to the undone work. (3) After getting our camper back (a few months into the year they had the camper) we discovered 2 new things had broken while at their facility (kitchen pin lights and kitchen ceiling fan) and of course we were responsible for the repair.\nWere they capable to do of the repairs? Yes, I really think so. But I have to conclude that they have no motivation to complete the repairs in a timely manner, no pride in their work, poor communication between customer service and the technicians...

We do the very best that we can to go above and beyond to take care of every customer that comes through our door. We could get your interior lights to come on, but the way the interior components are straight wired to the battery and not to a fuse or power distribution panel creates a fire hazard. You and your family\u2019s safety is the most important thing to us. That is why we recommended an airstream dealer.
