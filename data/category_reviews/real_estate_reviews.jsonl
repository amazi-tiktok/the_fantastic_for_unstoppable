We contacted him on a Friday morning asking if he could arrange cabin tours around Weiss Lake on Saturday (yes, one day later!).  He agreed, asked a series of questions around the type of property we were looking for and developed a large list of properties that fit our needs exactly.  We met him the following morning and he spend most of the day with us reviewing several properties.  His translation from our brief discussion to the types of properties he showed us was absolutely perfect.\n\nDuring our tour day, he continued adding homes to the list including contacting other realtors and owners that day asking for time to show us properties.   Finally he made one last minute appointment that he had been working on all day.  We saw the property, fell in love and decided then and there to make an offer.  There was no way this would have been possible without Tyrone.\n\nFirst, Tyrone knows this area and people there very very well, so he could show us many options and manage our ridiculously tight schedule. Second, he was very honest about questions we asked about the various properties, value, water depth, comparisons to other properties he had sold, and price . Third, he is very punctual and efficient.  Even through the obstacles of our our distance, crazy schedule, and our very specific needs, Tyrone made us feel part of the community throughout the process.

I knew about my relocation about 4 months before leaving my home and decided to get into contact with a realtor to get the ball rolling. I called about 4 or 5 different realtors before I got ahold of Liz Smith at Century21. She made our process smooth and efficient. Liz took the time to cater to all of our needs and wants. Over the course of our move she corresponded with us by email, over the phone and in person once we reached our destination. The time and commitment she took was paramount to our success. I believe she really takes all aspects of her clients situation into account and really makes it work in their favor with her ability to knock down walls and build bridges to achieve the desired outcome.
