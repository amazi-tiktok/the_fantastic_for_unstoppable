We will never be back and will tell everyone not to go.\n\nWe were called on our first night and was told not to drive the golf carts off the gravel for the first half of the day the next day since it rained. Okay, fair enough. So at about 11:45, we drove our cart off the gravel and onto a trail close to one of the first ponds in the place. It was about mid day. The ground was dry. We get our keys taken away while out on the water. We watched the security guard take them. We went to the office to complain and he called us liars saying the owner said the full day.\n\nWe had dogs there and where we were staying, there was a fence. We let the dogs out of the car and into the fence, and we got yelled at by the security guard because they were not on a leash. We asked why because they were in a closed fence? His response\u2026 ON A LEASH!!!! No explanation. A stray dog came up to us later that day and he came up red in the face screaming at us because she wasn\u2019t on a leash. We explained that it wasn\u2019t our dog and he didn\u2019t care.\n\nThis is the most backwards place to stay. It feels more like a prison. Do not go here ever. You couldn\u2019t pay me to stay here.

In short, a couple moved in wanting our spot. They kept calling the owners on us with untruthful accusations. The wife kept talking to me one morning while I was trying to load my car for work. I asked her to please just leave me alone. She would not stop. I just kept loading my stuff and asked again to leave me alone. The next day I get a call from Mindy, the owner while at work and she let's in on me with several slanderous accusations. She tells me my dog must be removed from the property by that night and if we do not comply, she will call the sheriff. Not once did she ever discuss anything with me prior to this day. I tell you Mindy is the most unprofessional person I have ever met. Talk about accused, charged and found guilty without a trial. We never had words with anyone or were ever warned by the owners. I assure you, the ones who did what we were accused of is still there!!!! My husband did have a civil conversation two days before with the owner's husband and thought they had an understanding. ????I must take this moment to thank Mindy because I did not like her from the first time I met her. We LOVE our new home. We have LOTS of water pressure!!!! I mean my Dawn makes bubbles in the sink!!!! FREE WI-FI!!!!!!! Mindy advertises free wi-fi.  What a joke. We have a foot more room inside our motorcoach. The power was so low there we couldn't get them to slide completely out!! Every time I cooked there I flipped a breaker. We can use all my appliances at one time now!!!! We have grass and a picnic table. Clyde, our service dog, is welcome and has a huge field he can run in. The owners are so kind and welcoming. Our first night here in our new rv park  the owner said they close at six but come on back, he'd be drinking a beer on the front porch and so we joined him!!! The good lord has blessed us with some great friends from Kick Back and I hope we never lose touch. Thank those who loved and accepted us and Clyde. We will never forget your blessings on us.\n\nI failed to mention the owner, Mindy showed up on our lot as soon as my husband got home from work (the same day i received a call at work from Mindy with her accusations)with the park manager and the security  guard carrying an assault rifle!!!!!
