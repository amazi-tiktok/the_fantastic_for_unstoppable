We set a high standard for ourselves in serving our clients & we're sorry that this was not met in your interaction with our business.  We strive to be as clear & transparent with itemized pricing on our service envelopes detailing parts, labor & totals along with a detailed description of work to be done as to remove any chance of surprise at pickup.  Regarding your visit, we created two separate envelopes because we provided two different services, one pair of earrings with 18k protector backs & specialty posts & one pair of earrings with 18ky screw posts & screw backs.  On each envelope, we included an in-depth description of parts & labor needed to complete your job along with the total.  Each envelope had a total written & differing totals ($257.10 & $300.70) due to different mechanisms.  We DID obtain your signature on each envelope as acknowledgement & confirmation of the details regarding the services BEFORE we proceeded.  We understand that your complaint is that our 10 yr. sales professional, Santana, did not give you \"the grand total verbally\".  It is very typical for a client that may want to pick up their services independently from one another, i.e.:  $257.10 one week & the $300.70 the next week.  Although we may have fallen short with \"verbally\" providing you with the grand total, we were completely transparent with our detailed written description & totals for each signed envelope.  We do value you as a new customer as well as your other family members & hope you will reconsider visiting Jewelry by Design in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

I walked into Jewelry by Design with my custom made, one of a kind engagement ring. It has 4 bands that meet in the back. My engagement ring had cracked where the bands meet and one of the bands had broken off. I still don\u2019t know how it happened but I was devastated so I took it in to get it repaired. I took it to Jewelry by Design because of all the great reviews and because the original jeweler was now retired. When I took it in, the service was great and I also asked to resize down 1/4 size because it had been fitting loosely. My first indication that something wasn\u2019t right should have been when they didn\u2019t check to see if they agreed that I needed it resized. When I came back for my ring, I could no longer put it on my finger after only going down a 1/4 size and they had bent the bands causing the halo for the diamond to be out of place. It no longer looked like the same ring and the setting for the diamond was crooked. I went back to them the next day and explained that I believed somewhere in the resizing process/repair that some of the bands looked a little out of place and asked if they would be able to fix it. I also brought a picture of the ring to show how it looked originally. The jeweler at this point was incredibly rude and even asked if the picture was of the same ring. I then explained to him that it was and stated again that this was a one of a kind ring and that it did not look like the picture and also didn\u2019t fit. He then proceeded to tell me that I had not needed to get it resized in the first place and didn\u2019t understand why I had gotten it resized. He also said that he had only done work in the back so anything that was messed up in the front was not his doing. He walked away at this point and his sales rep picked up the conversation asking if we wanted it resized. I said yes and that I would like it fixed to look like the picture. She relunctantly asked me to send the picture to the store email. I was charged more for the resizing than I had been originally and they told me it would take a week to resize it. I should have at this point taken it elsewhere but I wanted to give them a chance to fix their mistake. A week later I got a call in which the jeweler said that he had gotten it \u201cas close as humanly possible to the picture.\u201d He also said that the ring was unstable and that it needed additional structural support insinuating that it was poorly designed. My fianc\u00e9 picked up the ring and much to our disappointment and frustration it looked nothing like the picture. The 4 bands had originally been crossing and now they were parallel to each other. On top of that they removed the 14k gold stamp from the inside of the band. I hope that doesn't mean that they used some other metal when they resized it. I don\u2019t know how he thought that it looked like the picture. I have shown several friends and family members the before pictures and what it looks like now and they all agree that it\u2019s not even close. To make matters worse he added tacks to the ring saughtering the bands together. This was not part of the original design nor had we asked for it and he never called to ask before he modified the ring. The jeweler was again very rude to my fianc\u00e9 when he picked up the ring making comments about how the design was unstable and insinuated the damage to the ring had been some how done by my fianc\u00e9 between leaving the store and giving it back to me 10 minutes later. We believe that our poor treatment was due to our college age and that the piece was from another jeweler. The jeweler who had created our ring had designed most of my family\u2019s engagement rings, had been in business as a family for over 80 years, and was highly respected as a master jeweler for his unique design and pieces. So to anyone who has jewelry designed by another jewler or who is young do not go to this establishment because they are extremely arrogant and have no respect for you or your jewelry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

They have a beautiful high quality selection. We worked with Stephanie and she was so sweet patient and professional.  We purchased a new setting for my engagement ring solitaire while we were vacationing there and my solitaire fell out(after 10 years). They helped me select the perfect ring. We put it in layaway as our 10th anniversary was in December(this happened in June). I forgot to snap a picture of it while we were there so I called Stephanie and she happily got it out of the safe and put it on her own finger and sent me pictures via text message. She went above and beyond! We were shopping with our kids and they offered them chocolates and water. We called to have my diamond placed in the new ring on Wednesday of this week and they placed it on the same day we called and overnighted the ring to me for free. I live 6 hours from Gulf Shores. It was at my door the next morning. It is so beautiful! I am so thankful we went there to see about getting my original ring repaired and ended up with a gorgeous new ring that has special meaning since it was purchased at one of my favorite vacation spots.

I was very impressed with the professionalism shown towards me and my wife to complete the work and take care of her ring! They even had the ring done two days ahead of time!

I brought my fianc\u00e9 with me on the first visit just as a \u201clooking around town\u201d type of visit. When we met Read he was genuinely excited that we had been referred to him and took a lot of time to explain the types of bands and diamonds available. We left with a few solid ideas on the band (this was big progress!). I came back to see Read by myself and selected the band. He then helped me shop for the right diamond, something I was still unsure about. Read has access to diamonds from all over the country of varying qualities, sizes, and cuts. He gave me some parameters of the size and cut he thought would look good in the band. Once I selected a few options we discussed price. All I asked for was a fair price and I truly believe I got it. The other thing that was important to us was for there to be service after the sale. Read Kloss has a great reputation and the times I was in his store return customers would stop by to browse, drop items for repair, or just to say hi. There was a relationship. Bottom line-my wife loved her ring. She bought me a watch from Klos Diamond Center as a wedding gift. I have been back several times for anniversary and birthday gifts.

I'm a newly engaged man in my 30's and having never purchased any jewelry before.  Naturally I reach out to my family and my Step-Dad was quick to say \"Go see Read. He'll take care of you.\"  Read has been my Step-Dad's jeweler for years so I knew who he was but had never dealt with him first hand.  He definitely took care of me to say the least!  From the moment I walked in Read and his staff were extremely helpful, had a great selection to look at, listened to what I was looking for and what my budget was, were extremely patient, and helped me find \"the ring\" that has had people asking my fianc\u00e9e where I got that beautiful ring from!\n\nNow keep in mind that I had actually picked out two different rings and due to certain circumstances had to change my mind twice before finding \"the ring\"!  The response from Read was always the same, \"hey that's fine, not a problem, now let's find the one!\"\n\nAfter that Read, knowing what I was looking for, based on our conversations, found exactly what I was looking for in a ring and then found a great deal on a beautiful diamond in the parameters I wanted and in my budget!  And did I mention he did it quickly!!!  His communication with me the entire time was quick and easy and constant between the phone calls, texts, and emails.\n\nThe customer service didn't stop after the purchase though.  He set up a wonderful, private, jewelry soir\u00e9e for my Fianc\u00e9e and her friends which they thoroughly enjoyed!!  Next, when she went to go get the ring sized, her Facebook post read \"When you walk in to have your ring sized and your jeweler greets you by name and offers you wine. He gets me.\"  The fact that he takes care of my Lady when I'm not there, speaks volumes and is greatly appreciated!!!\n\nIf you're looking for a jeweler to be YOUR JEWELER, that will learn what your style is and more importantly your Lady's style, take care of you both every step of the way, with great service...

We timed it out where I would be able to pick up her ring before I left school after graduation and that time passed. We figured it would only be a bit behind schedule, but after 4-5 months of waiting (on a 6-8 week purchase) we had to buy a new band from somewhere else. We didn't receive a single call or email from them regarding the delayed shipment and we had to call every couple of weeks to hear that it was on its way. They had apparently ordered it from overseas and instead of getting us a new ring when ours didn't show up they just sat around and waited for it. it got to be a month before our wedding and we knew we couldn't wait any longer so we had to call them up and demand a refund (because they didn't offer us one even after all that time).

Since our 10th anniversary was approaching, I asked Benjy to help with the redesign.  He asked me to give him an idea of the style I like. I printed out a few images online and we looked through the cases for similar styles. The diamonds from my original bridal set were princess cut, and I wanted them to be the focal point in the new ring. I found a setting in the store that I really liked, but it didn't accommodate my diamonds. Benjy went to work measuring and configuring a new setting based on all these different components. A few days later he showed me a digital image of the proposed new ring. We talked about it, tweaked a few items, took more measurements, and he had an updated image of the design a few days later.  I was very happy with what he'd come up with, so we moved forward with having the mounting casted. A couple weeks later they took my diamonds to be placed in the new setting. My husband and I picked up the new ring this past week. I'm blown away!  It's breathtaking!  Far better than I imagined.

We had an engagement ring custom-made and it took us almost SIX months to finally get the ring back.  We never got exactly what had been promised, but finally got close enough and gave up.   During the stressful course of events, many things happened that were unprofessional and just poor business. Some of the lowlights include:\n\n-the staff repeatedly forgot that we were using our own gems (the whole reason we had a ring custom made)\n\n-staff seemingly just forgot about us multiple times.  they were supposed to send a design and a week, two weeks, three weeks would go by and then i would call to check and they would make up an excuse about their e-mail system crashing or their daughter had accidentally deleted their e-mails.\n\n-Had the ring made a completely wrong size (even after telling them repeatedly in person and through e-mail the correct size)\n\n-After ring had been made the completely wrong size, we were told they would fix it as soon as possible.  I received a phone call two days later saying that everything was taken care of and the ring had been resized.  We came into town the following day to pick up the ring and it had not been touched.  It was still the same wrong size it had originally been made.  Then the jeweler who would have to resize was out of town on vacation for a week.\n\n-When it finally was resized, the bands did not fit snugly against the engagement ring like they had before, and the staff was condescending to my finance and tried to make her think it had always fit that way.\n\n-The staff lost our extra diamonds and gold from the ring then tried to act like we had traded those in, even though that had never been discussed.\n\nThe store looks fancy and the staff looks professional, but it is all a facade.  If you just need to walk in and buy a ring, they could probably get that right, but I would NOT trust them with any custom work and will not be using them again for any of our jewelry needs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b79f4c74e39:0x817d54d1b05f7541"}

I have had a sorted history with this watch over the years with other jewelers in TN who have gouged me and taken upwards of six months to complete a job so now that I am a local here I wasn't sure what to expect from my local jeweler. Well these guys did a quick turnaround at a very reasonable price and not only replaced the stem but my  watch was so clean and polished that I did a double take because, at first, I thought they had given me a brand new watch by mistake. Nope, it is my watch and I could not have been happier.\n\nNow as for the business, they have a wonderful selection of what you expect. Rings, watches, bracelets, earrings, etc. but they also have beautiful local artist pieces that are absolute stunning from inexpensive ocean themed pieces to a gorgeous diamond piece we just saw that range in prices into the thousands. They also buy gold and make custom pieces of your own design right in house.\n\nWe're here to yesterday to get my watch band repaired and they did it in minutes at no charge! That brings me to just how friendly, professional and all around terrific that everyone here, that I've encountered, are.

She lives in the condo complex where we were renting for the week. So I asked her if she could recommend a nice place to eat and if she knew of a good jeweler. She right away told us of some places to eat, then she called her jeweler friend Glenn Manning and got me an appt with him. She told me that Manning Jewelers\u2019s has been in business for over 70 yrs. and how awesome everyone there is. And she was so right about that. And she showed me her beautiful ring that Glenn made for her.\nGlenn took my old wedding and turned it into the most beautiful wedding ring I\u2019ve ever seen. My husband and I were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary in Gulf Shores. Because our trip to St Lucia was canceled due to Covid! And we had been planning to make some changes with my ring anyway, so this was the best time for us to do that. I believe God puts people in our life path for a reason. So meeting Pepper, then meeting Glenn was a huge blessing for us.\nMy husband was very impressed how Glenn designed my ring on his computer then made a resin ring to hold my stones so I could see how it would look and feel on my finger. I wanted to use my existing center stone as a side stone to represent our past 35 yrs of marriage, then added a new larger center stone for the present, and another side stone to match for the future. Then we decided to add a two sided ring guard using my existing ring guard diamonds. So not only did Glenn design a beautiful ring for me, he also saved us a lot of money. And he recommended a great company to insure my new ring with, which had a better price than our home owners insurance co.\nI was very nervous about having my new ring shipped to me once it was done, just a few short weeks later, but Glenn put my mind at ease letting me know it will be insured and it came over night at my convenience. The whole process was Awesome! As well as the entire staff at Manning Jewelers. So if your heading to Gulf Shores, Al, or just looking for an Amazing  jeweler in that area, be sure to look up Manning Jewelers in Foley, Al. They are worth the drive from anywhere.\nWe also bought a really nice \u201cflip flop\u201d neck less for our daughter while we were in Manning\u2019s  and she loves it. Plus Manning Jewelers\u2019s also has a beautiful pendant called Stray Love that Glenn designed himself and he donates 20% of each sale to their foundation to help save stray animals. Best company to work with for all your jewelry needs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598110336782, "text": "Wow! Thank you Dena!

The plentiful selection that Griffins offers is top notch and is sure to delight the toughest of critics. Best wishes for my upcoming proposal left me feeling confident and relieved knowing that I made a purchase from the best people in the industry.\n\nMichael Abernathy and the knowledgeable staff at Griffins remain a vital part in our lives even after our wedding.

Don't get me wrong, those rings were beautiful, but they seemed overpriced and all looked the same. Even after showing the employees of those stores pictures of rings that I did like, they would still come back with the same ole ring I just looked at. Some of those employees remained professional and would tell me that they didn't offer anything else, while some became very rude and seemed to take it personal that we didn't buy the ring immediately. It was becoming a very stressful and unenjoyable venture.\n\nHowever, we luckily came across Griffin's Jewelers in Pell City after I searched for related images on Google. I had never been there and assumed that they probably had the same handful of rings all the other stores had, but was more than willing to give it a try.\n\nI couldn't have been more wrong! We were very pleasantly greeted by Michael and Stephanie when we entered the store and they remained helpful and attentive without making us feel pressured to do anything. They have a large selection of rings and most of the rings were already unique in their own ways; meaning they actually have a large selection of Different rings! I showed them pictures of rings and because of their knowledge of jewelry in general, as well as their own inventory, they were able to quickly locate rings that had the features I was looking for. It definitely felt as though a weight had been lifted.\n\nI ended up finding a ring that looked even more unique than the style I had originally been looking for and I love it! My fiance didn't complain about the price at all either; he was given a more than reasonable price and would have paid so much more for this ring elsewhere.\n\nWe're very grateful for Michael, Stephanie, and the everyone else at Griffin's Jewelers!

My husband had purchased my ring and I brought it in to get resized. That was my first visit and it was okay. They said to give them at least 5 days but I should receive it back sooner. 2 days later and they called back! I was thrilled! I was surprised how quickly the turnaround was. I left but the ring was too snug. I brought it back and the entire time the young lady was assisting me she seemed like I was a nuisance. Very unpleasant and I just couldn\u2019t wait to get the heck out of there. Again, they had a very quick turnaround and when I walked in not one word was said to me. I walked up and I almost spoke first but I wanted to see how long this would last. FIVE employees there and not one spoke a word to me. When I got up to the counter still nothing was said.

Whenever a jeweler sizes a ring, they then have to follow up on their work by checking each individual stone and tightening it, which can become very labor intensive when you are dealing with rings that have a large number of tightly spaced stones down the shoulder and onto the shank.  When it's all said and done, our objective is to make sure that when you get your ring back, you can wear it with full confidence that everything will remain where it belongs, from the ring on your finger down to the smallest stone on the shank.\n\nAgain, thank you so much, and I hope that helps clarify our policies a bit for you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888dd4d29378307f:0x3fa4cd5e97e0d99d"}

They insist they have high standards for the diamonds they select, but they do not. Lastly, I believe they profiled my Latino boyfriend during our shopping experience.\n\nTo give some context, I sold high end jewelry for several years and helped with buying pieces for my store, custom designs for my clients, and sold many different watches and jewelry pieces from my store. I have a strong knowledge of diamonds and jewelry. I shopped at Bromberg in two capacities - both looking for an engagement ring as well as a simple bracelet repair. I'll start with the repair.\n\nI brought my simple 14k gold bracelet to be shortened. The jeweler probably spent about 5 minutes to measure, cut and solder my bracelet together. I was charged $40. I also asked to be returned my spare gold. When I went to pickup my bracelet, they did not have the spare gold and told me the jeweler wasn't in so I could wait for a call. When I didn't receive a call, I called them. They said the jeweler knew about it and would find it for me. It took 4 days total and they then left me a message that \"they think\" they found it, but aren't sure, and asked me to bring my bracelet in for them to verify. I came in and the piece they had did not match, so they took my bracelet upstairs to go look, and did eventually find it. Overall this was a negative experience and the repair was much more expensive than either of the two jewelers I worked for personally.\n\nSecondly, my engagement ring shopping experience. An associate (not Lemka) explained that they have a high standard for the stones they carry and the custom process if I were to go that route for the setting. The 2.01 carat D SI2 I looked at in store was priced well over $20,000, I can't remember the exact price but somewhere between 20-23k. When I went home, I pulled the GIA certification info on the stone and found there to be a massive cavity inclusion on the bottom of the stone that they failed to disclose to me. That cavity would get dirty over time and make the stone look worse. I'm disappointed they would even carry such a stone, let alone peddle it for such an incredibly high price. That stone was wildly overpriced as such and I wouldn't have purchased it, even at a deep discount due to the cavity.\n\nDuring this visit, my boyfriend was with me looking at settings and diamonds, and briefly walked over to the watch counter to see what they had. When he started walking over there, one of the male employees shouted across the store for the security person to go over and stand by the watches. I felt awkward and insulted that they felt the need to call security over to babysit the area when we were already considering giving them our business on such a major purchase. I don't feel they would have had the same reaction if he was white and in a suit. Disappointing for it being 2020 and to still have such an experience.\n\nAfter that event, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and went back to meet with the jeweler about a custom solitaire setting. He quoted me between 3-4K for a simple solitaire setting that I had handmade elsewhere for around $1550 from a well known local Chicago jeweler with a lifetime guarantee. Between the profiling incident and everything being wildly overpriced, I chose to take my business elsewhere. I love my 2.5 carat oval and custom setting I chose, and would not send anyone I know to Bromberg for any reason. If for some reason you insist on going there, be prepared to shell out extra cash simply for the mountain brook location, and be sure to work with Lemka.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607632559320, "text": "Elena, we are so disappointed that you had a less than positive experience at our store. Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. I have passed your message along to our store manager.\n\nWe hate there was some miscommunication with your repair but are glad everything was resolved for you. As you can probably imagine, our jewelers see hundreds of repairs each week and occasionally slip ups do happen. Unfortunately yours involved an extra trip to the store to correctly identify your chain. We appreciate your patience with this!\n\nWe do regret we weren't able to find the right diamond and setting for you. All of our diamonds come with GIA certifications so we can be clear, upfront, and honest about every stone we sell. We try to keep a variety of diamonds in stock to fit all budgets and dreams, but we do sometimes have to order in more stones if we don't have exactly what you are looking for. You seem very knowledgeable about diamonds, and if you would like to discuss our stock and exactly what goes into the pricing, we would be more than to chat with you over the phone, in store, or by email.\n\nAs far as the profiling issue, all our staff members are trained to be aware of potential threats, and it sounds like this was not a threatening situation. We certainly do not make blanket judgments based on race or attire.  We make every attempt to make sure every customer feels welcome in our stores.  Please accept our apology for making you or your boyfriend feel uncomfortable in any way!\n\nWe are appreciative of your kind words about Lenka. We value her great customer service skills, and I have passed your positive comments about her along.\n\nWe are glad you found your dream ring even if it wasn't from our store. You are always welcome back to either of our locations anytime, even for free cleanings and prong inspection for your new ring. We sincerely hope we can help you again in the future with a better outcome!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888919865357154f:0xd2e56d05d10d3842"}

I read their reviews and decided that they were the best fit for what I was looking for. I am so glad I chose them.

We corresponded via phone and text and he really made me feel at comfortable and made the transaction very easy. I wanted the baby\u2019s name and date of birth engraved on the necklace as well, so he waited to complete the necklace until she was born. By the way I threw in a key chain for the dad at the last minute rather than wait for Father\u2019s Day.  Baby girl was born 05/02 and I had both the necklace and keychain by 05/08.

Meffords was the first place we visited.  My fiancee lives two hours away from Florence and I was not in the habit of visiting jewelry stores, so I asked friends and coworkers who they recommended.  The number one answer I received was Mefford Jewelers.\n\nWe could not have been more pleased.  Toddman Thompson, the manager, spent a considerable amount of time talking with us and making us feel right at home.  He even encouraged us to visit other jewelry stores to see what they have to offer in terms of products and services.  I'm so glad we did.  We saw a lot of nice jewelry and met a lot of nice people, but none that came close to comparing with Mefford.\n\nMy fiancee decided she liked a ring at Mefford best of all.  Ironically, we found a ring just like it at another Jewelry store in Florence, but Mefford had a much better price as well as service.  I was thrilled to purchase the ring from Mefford Jewelers because my fiancee and I both know it's top quality at a great price from a family owned business right in my hometown of Florence.\n\nI would say to anyone looking for a jeweler to do business with in the Shoals area - visit Mefford Jewelers.  They will treat you right.  And I believe you will be so glad you did.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1575601400935, "text": "Hi Russ.  Thank you for the review.

The salesperson, Taylor Schweighardt, was extremely nice and told me they generally did not do watch repair, however he asked me what I needed. I explained that the clasp kept opening while on my wrist and I was unable to wear it for fear of losing it. Since the repair was not on the watch itself but only on the band he attempted to repair it right then but was unsuccessful. However, he offered to call Citizen and find out if he could get a replacement band (witch he didn't have to do). He called me the next day and said that Citizen had discontinued that specific band and they had nothing comparable. Since that was the case, I told him he might as well just dispose of the watch since there was nothing else that could be done. I thanked him for going out of his way to do everything he could to salvage my watch. At home I got on line and considered purchasing a new watch but changed my mind since I had another less expensive watch I could wear as a replacement until I could purchase something better. Two days passed and Taylor had called and left me a message to call him.  When I did he had good news.  He and the owner of the shop (Billy) had put their heads together and figured out how to repair the band. I was so surprised, I was speechless!  I went to get it the next day and asked  how much I owed them and they said no charge.  I insisted on paying them but they said no, but any referrals would certainly be appreciated.  They specialize in stunning hand created top of the line diamond and gem jewelry, and I might add, thoughtful, top of the line service as well!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559342193217, "text": "Thank you for the kind words, it was our pleasure to be able to assist you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x887d485e73215c41:0xf87e913e61a9a851"}

I cannot explain what sets Goldstein\u2019s apart until I share the negative experience I had at another jewelry store in Mobile, so I will share that first.\n\nLike I said, I had a ring repair somewhere else first. The other jewelry store not only sized my ring down (when I didn\u2019t ask for it to be sized down), but failed to claim fault for it.  My diamond had fallen out of my setting and I asked the other jewelry store to reset the diamond and also solder my wedding band and engagement band together. When I got my rings back from them, my ring was a size 5 3/4 which is 3/4 smaller than the original size, which was a  size 6 (rings also fit tighter when they\u2019re soldered together, so it fit much tighter than before.) I want to also note that their store never sized me in store either, but rather had the ring repaired with no size listed in their system. Goldstein\u2019s makes a practice of sizing you and placing the size in the system, anytime you come in for ring repairs so that it is never your word against theirs.\n\nWhen I came back to the other store, not only did they not apologize, they did not want to take apart my soldered rings and resize them individually (so as to protect the integrity of them) , but they recommended making the two rings into one. The sales associate also sized me as a size 7 which is A LOT larger than the size 5 3/4 ring they had sent me home with just a few days before!\n\nI felt something was off with how everything was being handled, so I decided to not have my repairs done there but instead have them done somewhere else...which would be how I ended up at Goldstein\u2019s a few days later.\n\nWhen I went to Goldstein\u2019s, they measured my finger and reassured me that yes, the other store had sized my ring incorrectly. The rings wouldn\u2019t even fit on my finger without redness and swelling (which the other jewelry store associate said was due to having large knuckles, or perhaps even the humid weather.)\n\nGoldstein\u2019s assured me they stood behind their sizing methods. The other jewelry store actually told me they didn\u2019t guarantee their fit and scoffed over the phone when asked if they guaranteed the fit. Goldstein\u2019s on the other hand, said that they do guarantee the fit they size you with in store. They didn\u2019t make me feel like I was being unreasonable at any step of the way, like I felt at the other store. They affirmed me, as one should do when providing quality customer service.\n\nGoldstein\u2019s measured me as a size 6 1/2  and I noticed they had a careful attention to fit, and also that their ring sizing methods seemed more legitimate than what I was offered at the other jewelry store (they used individual rings to size me at Goldstein\u2019s, and the other store used a keychain of sorts full of various sized rings. I was more impressed with the Goldstein\u2019s method because if you\u2019re getting rings soldered together, you want to see how the two stacked rings will fit your finger and that they come off easily, versus what was offered at the other store, with only one ring being placed on the finger to determine fit.)\n\nIf I had gone through with the second round of repairs at the other store, I would have been paying for extra gold that I would have had removed anyway because they sized me as a 7, and my true size is a 6 1/2, as determined by Goldstein\u2019s (my rings fit beautifully now!) Goldstein\u2019s got it right the FIRST time versus the other store which didn\u2019t get it right the first two times.\n\nAll this to say, Goldstein\u2019s did everything correctly and professionally. They even texted me to see how my rings were fitting a week later. I call that excellent customer service.\n\nIf you want a correct fit the first time with no back and forth issues that make you second guess yourself, and if you\u2019d rather have extra money in your pockets (unlike I do, since I had to pay for correct repairs that the other store failed to provide) then please, go to Goldstein\u2019s!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601480386580, "text": "Thanks so much for the great review.

If only I knew my experience with them later will be so emotionally and mentally traumatizing, I'd have never stepped foot in that store.\nI had insisted I'd rather patronize a local business rather than purchase online contrary to what my boyfriend wanted. In the store, I chose a ring that was in the showcase. It wasn't my size so I was told they'd order one in my size, also the diamond for the ring was not kept in the store so i had to wait for over a month for it to come in store. Unfortunately my wedding was called off and so I decided to return the rings for a refund 6 days after purchase was made and three days since receiving it from the store. There is a 15 day return policy for a full refund. I was denied a full refund because as the store owner stated; \" Its bad for my business\" and offered a 50% refund instead, which i refused. I don't understand why I  should bargain for a refund I'm  entitled  to. When I insisted to be treated fairly and given my refund,the store owner  Richard Frank Jr,  made comments suggesting bias and racism against my color and country of origin.Insinuating I'm ignorant and stupid because I'm a foreigner from another country and had an accent.  I have never been treated like this in any other store environment and urge any other potential customers to beware and steer clear of this rude and racist  business.

Most recent I was in the store looking for a replacement chain, sterling silver for my granddaughter, who has struggles with speical needs, Angela found the perfect little affordable chain to fit our needs, and even added a little piece of chain, so she could adjust it on her neck, didn\u2019t charge us for her quick fix of placing the small charm on the necklace, that met so much to my granddaughter, I only paid for the small chain and we were out the door, as I was leaving she offered me a water for the road. That is such wonderful service, the kind you don\u2019t get anywhere else. That charm was left at another store for over two weeks, just to be placed on a chain, when it wasn\u2019t ready for my granddaughter\u2019s flight, the jewelry store had a hard time finding our ticket and never seemed to mind, because we were only spending less then fifty. If ever I spend thousands, and I hope to do that one day soon, I will spend it at Goldstein \u2018s.

She then proceeded to show us settings and told us if we wanted to use my diamond they could put it in one of the settings, made a \"joke\" that I could have two sets and decide which set I wanted to wear based on the outfit I was wearing. Showed us countless settings then informed us to draw a picture of what we had in mind and bring it in.  Throughout the experience, a price point was never discussed.  We feel the store manager made a judgement call on what we could afford based on my current wedding set.  Needless to say, we left feeling very disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1502309582161, "text": "We apologize for your experience, Ashley, whilst an apology will regrettably not alter the outcome or your experience, I do extend it will all sincerity.

The owner changed my battery and then admitted to me that he had broken the watch crystal (clear glass over watch face). He reassured me that he would fix my watch. He is a liar, thief and con-artist. In the almost two months that they were \u201cfixing\u201d my watch I went 3 times to try to get any information. Finally I just gave up and told them to give me my watch broken. The owner was rude, impolite and intimidating.\nWhenever; I informed him that I wanted my watch immediately regardless of the fact that 2 months later it was STILL BROKEN. He said that he had tried to \u201cmake it right\u201d and that he had been looking to buy me another watch from EBAY. The watch I have is a limited edition Android Prism watch that is no longer being made. He said that he had been unable to find any watch similar to mine. While I do not watch a watch from EBAY; I would like to point out that in the last 4 minutes I have found over 5 watches currently for sale on EBAY with the exact same crystal. These are not cheap Wal-Mart watches; he simply did not even try to find a similar watch.\nThe owner stated that since he had been unable to find a similar watch on ebay (lie) that he would have to send the watch out to Las Vegas to have a crystal custom made. If that was the case then why after 2 months was my watch still sitting on the counter? Why had they not already sent it to be fixed?  It does not take 2 months to drive to the post office. It is apparent that they had no plans on trying to fix my watch.\nWhen the watch was originally broken by the owner, it had a tiny chip in the upper right corner. The watch has received even more damage since it has been in their possession. The original chip has spread to 3 times the size along with a new crack on the upper left. The back is covered in DOZENS of scratches and the hands do not seem to be functioning correctly.\nThe owner did not even try to fix my watch. He did not even offer a replacement. Under no circumstances should anyone ever go to these people. Now all I have is a broken piece of crap, and no way to have it fixed or repaired. They broke my watch and refused to fix it.

First my fianc\u00e9 (now my husband) and I were living in Washington, DC when we saw a piece that Mr. Davis created! I loved the lady's ring some much that I had to know where she purchased the ring. She referred us to Mr. Davis at Davis Fine Jewelry. We flew down to visit with him about 6 months before the wedding. He was very direct and straight forward about cost, delivery time and steps that would be included in fruition to the finished product. He was true to his word. From the moment he finished casting the mold for my unique one-of-a kind ring, he called to allow me to see the size, demensions and make sure I was comfortable and satisfied with the direction the project was going. Even in the middle of the business's move from the location near Eastdale to the new location now closer to the Montgomery Mall area, he kept me abreast of each step. By the time I saw my ring, even without the stones set, I was estatic! Mr. Davis IS a \"Master Jeweler\"! He will even pray over your ring and marriage! I was equally excited to have Mr. Davis create my ring; since my grandparents met at Maxwell Airforce Base in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nI feel blessed to have such a unique, gifted and spiritual man create my exquisite and beautiful wedding ring ..... that has more substantive meaning for me.

I went in for a new battery for my husband's Movado watch. I inquired about a piece being welded back on a gold hoop earring that I had brought in on a Saturday back before the pandemic. The owner was not there but a young man was with an unkempt appearance. He quoted me $45. I told him that was more than I paid for them so I guess I would just sell them for scrap. So currently while in the jewelry shop, I inquired with the owner who informed me they have a $30/minimum. I was not told of that the 1st time I inquired. The owner began chatting saying, \"You know, I went to the dealership the other day, they told me my tire was going to be $150, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" Then he said, \"I went to the grocery store, they said my groceries were $100, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" While putting the battery in the watch, he stated, \"You know this watch has the wrong size battery?\" \"The battery is too big.\" I informed him it was purchased at a pawn shop so I have no clue who put the battery in but it worked for a long time. He said, \"Well, that's what you get buying from a pawn shop,\" in a condescending tone. I never requested a lower price on the earring repair. I will not pay for something only to be spoken to in this manner. His level of sarcasm was ridiculous.

Sorry you had a bad experience this time around. Hope the battery that we put into your watch stays working longer than the one you got from the pawn shop. As for your earring. You came in the store without it and you did want a price on how much it would cost to fix it. But we can not give a price on any item unless we actually see it. You said you talked with me before the pandemic and I told you it would cost 45 dollars apparently. And like you said in your comment \"that was more than I paid for them\".\nWe don't do any repairs on earrings for free and we do have a minimum price we charge on basic repairs like those. I know you wanted a cheaper price because you complained to the owner about it. That is why he gave you examples of other scenarios like the ones you posted in your comment. Hes by no means trying to upset you or offend you in anyway. He just wanted you to understand that we don't barter with prices and we can't just give you a price without seeing the item. The owner also is very honest and upfront with any problems with repairs. That is also why he was concerned and wanted to let you know your watch already had the wrong battery put in it. As for me, I am the young man replying to your review and I do reply to all reviews that concern me. I do believe calling me unkempt was rude and uncalled for especially since I never said anything bad at all to you and barely talked with you in our store.

The guys are very helpful and take their time to ensure you get the right fit to accommodate your finger.  I was very pleased with the outcome of the ring being sized.  They sized the ring down. The guys were finished with the ring and it was ready for me to pick it up in less than two hours. It cost me $55.00. Considering this was same day service,  taking less than two hours and AMAZING costumer service,  I consider the charge to be very reasonable. I can't stress how helpful these guys are when helping you.\nI will definitely return and as of my first experience today, I  have become a costumer for life.\nPlease don't let the other negative reviews prevent you from giving this business a chance. I read the reviews from others before going to this business. I went ahead and gave them a chance despite the negative reviews from others. The good reviews out weighed the bad reviews. I understand that each individual may have varying experiences when dealing with your jewelry. With that being said,  I quickly determined today that this business is costumer oriented and cares for their costumers satisfaction. I can't imagine if someone does have a problem with their work,  these guys would be more than willing to make it right. That's the impression I got today from them. They have very strong work ethic,  take pride in their work,  and are very knowledgeable.\nOh,  one more thing.... today when we were trying to determine the right size for my ring because this ring was a gift from my husband and is an addition to my wedding set, the guys examined the size of my wedding ring which is now the middle ring in my set. He discovered that my band was a little bent. He asked if I would like him to straighten it. He straightened it,  no charge! That's a real,  professional,  costumer oriented jeweler!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2652292ca55:0x21841c55b0c7bb0d"}

They replaced my watch battery which wasn't a normal sized battery, sized and polished my ring, and welded my broken necklace. They suggested I buy a new chain since it was just a simple Walmart one and more likely to break again. They also advised me not to wear it to sleep or in the shower like I have been. I've never had a decent chain for my necklace and the pendant was a gift from my significant other so I broke down and bought a box chain. I don't regret it at all. This new chain has lasted me over 6 months. As far as the work I've had done, it was all done within a few minutes (battery) to hours (ring size). The prices are reasonable for the work you get done.

I had a ring I got for our 2nd Anniversary that had gotten to small.\nSeveral other Jewelers told me it could not be sized. So it sat in a special case hoping one day it would fit. When I spoke to Amanda she said she thought they would be able to size it. Just bring it in and they would see. I found out that the reason my ring didn't fit was because I was sold the wrong size. Amanda sized the ring, sized my finger and checked to make sure none of the stones were missing. She was so polite and professional. I felt so comfortable with them I even gave them my engagement and wedding ring to be cleaned. Amanda did the same thing checked to make sure I wasn't missing stones or had loose stones. I got my rings back today and I am so happy with them. Diamond Depot is definitely where's all my jewelry will go in the future. And I already have my eyes on my next Anniversary present.

Didn\u2019t seem right so I decline and they didn\u2019t charge me for the new battery they gave me. I left with a bag full of watch parts. Later, I realized the gasket was damaged, I was missing parts, and with a battery that doesn\u2019t work. This watch is a standard Tissot, and doesn\u2019t need \u201cspecial\u201d parts to change out batteries. I will send my business elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595683816573, "text": "Hi Joseph.  In the 1000+ Watches we work on yearly, we do occasionally have a watch repair that requires a higher level of service than our on site Watch Repair shop feels comfortable offering. In those instances, we send the watch to our repairman in Texas, whom we have worked with for years, and they will repair and send back to us. The service is excellent and the pricing is very affordable for our customers.\n\nOut of all the watches we have replaced a battery on this year, yours was the only one that we needed to send off for further inspection. The reason was because of a damaged gasket (so it appeared) - but certainly it was beyond our comfort level of repair locally. Rather than continue to work with it locally, we felt the need to move it to a higher tier repairman so that we could offer the best service on your watch. Your response was that you had someone in Georgia who has worked on it before and could put the back on with the gasket, no problem. You seemed as if it was no problem and we assumed that was the case.\n\nIt appears that there your repairman in Georgia saw a similar issue that we did - that there was still a problem.   Our repairmen would have had no issue providing the service that was needed to complete the task but I understand that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with us taking care of the problem for you further. I\u2019m sorry you felt that way.  We certainly do everything we can to provide a level of service that makes people feel comfortable with allowing us to take care of them from start to finish. I believe, as you can see by the reviews, that we have always done our part to make things right and offer a service that ends with satisfaction.  While you may have felt uneasy about letting us finish the repair for you, I do not believe we have any type of reviews or history that would warrant that feeling from you. Instead, I believe it\u2019s just the opposite - that we have a proven record (shown on reviews) of making sure all of our customers are fully satisfied and we work hard to maintain this level of service.\n\nEither way, we are sorry you were unable to do business with us and see our service through to the end. But we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0xdc319865b7fa1df6"}

Frustrated and disappointed after our third meeting, I decided to scrap the whole project.\n\nWhen explaining the bad experience to a friend, she mentioned that Terry had recently designed an engagement ring for a relative which turned out beautifully. Since I live in Oxford, I figured I didn\u2019t have anything to lose so I dropped in one day to check it out. During our first meeting, Terry really took the time to listen to me, made notes and offered suggestions when I asked for them.\n\nOver the course of the design process, I completely changed what I wanted, but Terry and Amanda were very patient and encouraging. When I decided that I wanted side stones, they arranged to bring in three sets for me to view with my diamond to find the perfect match.  After I received the original CAD rendering, I realized that there were a few things that I wanted to change. Each suggestion was promptly incorporated into the design and a new CAD rendering sent.\n\nI was able to pick up my finished ring on Christmas Eve, and it was more stunning than I had ever imagined. Even though this was a custom design that involved a lot of personal service, the price for the setting was very reasonable.  I have worked with various jewelers on other projects and I can say without a doubt that Terry and Amanda\u2019s design capabilities and professionalism are the best I\u2019ve experienced. Thank you guys for a beautiful, one-of-a-kind ring!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592333188435, "text": "Michelle thank you!  I hope you're enjoying that beautiful ring!

I took it, along with the wedding bands she & dad wore, and her \"lucky\" ring. (The \"lucky ring\" was found on a trip to PCB some 25-30yrs ago. She spotted something shiny in the water and fished it out.) They took all the gold from the rings, plus some old necklaces and earrings, in as trade, and actually gave me $ back!

Much closer than Atlanta or Birmingham.  Amanda our diamond consultant was INCREDIBLE!!!   She has an awesome personality and was so patient with listening to our needs and wants.   Amanda\u2019s knowledge was also helpful.  We ended up special ordering my ring and could not be happier. Just WOW! LOVE IT!  The Oweners were there as well and adds the nice family atmosphere.   I think it is important to support small local businesses, but We got to do this and get the best service and quality we were looking for.  Their prices and customer service are not beatable.
