The company needs  be more organized and and clean. Staff are everywhere and rude to the people whom are trying to get assistance, Anniston, Alabama has barely no notary in the city and they make it mandatory to get paper notarized knowing that the customer are lacking financial support to do so; in need of service for their  family. Community action  is time waster and make no sense in how they operate their organization. If they government is funding this company I will be doing farther complaints of this company. I feel as if the people in Anniston does want to improve but the government assistance that the city offers belittle the people who are in need of help for the family, or growth which makes Anniston one of the most poor city in the USA it how the people use the income that the government has given to help the community but belittling and making something easy as 123 into 50 steps. Honestly 1 \u2b50\ufe0f is overly good for this company they should be shut down and let DHR deal with all the assistance including utilities assistance on the city of Anniston. I\u2019m new to this city with no family or friends but I do have a caseworker whom I deal with on the regular basis who knows my financial aspect of my life they would not let her make a statement Knowing that she works with the government they wanted the government employees to go with the client to get a paper notarized knowing the staff are not able to leave the building to do such and even if she it very very hard to find a notary. In pain I sat in the office for assistance with all that they have asked of me. I gave the company the only income letter that\u2019s a monthly basis they refused it and told me they will call me back; before leaving I talk to the staff on the fact that I really needed doctor assistance in my condition but had decided to come to the office as told instead of going to the ER so that it maybe complicated for them to contact me but can I get an appointment for another day. They told me they will call me; when I got home I had to go to the ER and since my lights were off I was unable to charge my phone. When I did charge my phone I called the company to still get assistance the customer service still nasty and rude on the phone. I mean if you don\u2019t want to help the community to be better quit cause is a lot of people who does want to help people that may need help time from time with gladness of helping others. The staffs of this company are not happy with their jobs and not trying to help the people; seating among the crowd of people the rudeness of the staff is really not fair they acting as if they have never needed a hand by belittling the customer in a very uncomfortable way. I saw elderly women standing on their feet, I saw pregnant women standing on the feet cause the company has no organization structure whatsoever. They said they open at 8 but had the customer in the breezy cold weather standing outside of the building after the company was supposed to be opened. I hope the government see this cause being new to this city and this being my first time I feel discrimination on single mothers like myself that really has no friends or family support they make it harder on someone that I\u2019m my position. I gave the company everything they had on the list including the only type of income that my family was receiving. They said that TANF is not a income for my family but for my kids which even now I\u2019m still puzzled on how when it clearly states \u201cTemporary assistance for needy family\u201d meaning a income for my family. If this was child support I will agree but this is a assistance that I\u2019m receiving from the government and they refuse that as my income.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb3958b7ea693:0x52db6f63f5ca7a60"}

If they think you will cave, they will threaten you with a Safety Plan and make you think they are putting your kids in Foster Care, if you do not sign it. Do not trust DHR. If DHR contacts you please get an attorney before you go see them. BEFORE YOU TALK TO DHR, PLEASE HAVE AN ATTORNEY.\n\nIf you do cave and sign it, they might tell you its only 45 days and its all over, but thats a LIE. Its 45 days for the case worker on the Safety Plan to create a petition against you that an Attorney has and presents to a judge against you. There is actually 60 days till they decide to drop it or make charges. They may say they will get you a free attorney, but get your own before they can cause any trouble to begin with. Also the attorney that is free is for your children so that DHR can make sure the children are safe. Safe against who, well that is you of course. You are getting a free attorney to prosecute you. Thanks DHR.\n\nBut wait there is more. During your so called Safety Plan they are going to want you to come in after 30 days and sign a ISP. That is an Individualized Service Plan. But you are on a Safety Plan already, so why do you need a new plan.  Well its so DHR can threaten you again. We were told they could have Foster Care there that day to take the kids. So you still don't have an Attorney and they scare you again into signing a new plan.\n\nWell its 2 months into it now. DHR will make you take Classes. Any class they can to prolong the case and assure they are making more money. The longer the case is open, the more cases they can show they have and get more money from the state. You will have attended another ISP and most likely through out all of this DHR will have told you very little and you half of what they told you is a Lie. They might say they were super busy and sorry I sent you the wrong document. Sorry I never said that time, and change you visitation times. Sorry I meant you both need to take these classes now, but you said only I had to.\n\nWell by now, you have finished your Classes and after trying really hard to have DHR get back with you, so your kids can come home, you finally get your kids back. Its been 3 to 4 months now.  Things are getting better.\n\nBut wait there is more. DHR can still investigate you another 90 days. Or so I was told. Maybe it is 90 days until she says my carpet is to dirty and adds on another 90 days. Who knows but they will continue to investigate you and your child's school for months, to a year, or even years.\n\nHopefully if you get Attorney before you ever speak with DHR. Your attorney will tell you what to NOT SAY and what to NOT DO so that DHR doesn't have any AMMO against you.  Get an Attorney to go with you to meet DHR. Do Not Go Alone like me and get abused by DHR. I am still paying for it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b41ab08b873:0xfe4d5b6d2bee2ce7"}

They give you a license, after they have been through your life, your home your extended family, and with recommendations from friends and co-workers paid babysitting and other fees to go to classes, this license that says you are clear to be foster parents, teaming up and working with DHR working together for the good of the children. This happened about 10 years ago in Madison County, DHR in Madison county stood by us when the CAJA worker and birth grand parents tried to press charges against us. They stood by us as we had to take our foster kids to CAC to talk about serious abuse that happened BEFORE they came to live with us. All documented in court, the  CAC and  DHR in Madison County.  We got a copy of all this when we adopted the kids. fast forward to 4 years ago we were able to do a private placement adoption, after we moved to Limestone County and were not longer licensed foster parents. Things went smoothly. This was a second chance adoption. this child had been in and out of foster care, and was adopted, but  it just didn't work out. Fast forward to about a year ago. We were asked to renew our license to help out some people who were loosing their kids to foster care. Once again the DHR social workers were good, and took time to make sure all was well and safe in our back ground and current home. These beautiful children were placed in our home. One of these kids started talking about a lot of serious abuse that happened BEFORE they came to live with us. My own adopted kids were still in therapy because of their abuse, so I started to make sure these kids were getting the help they needed to get the support they needed to understand boundaries, and what is safe and what isn't ok, and that NONE of it is their fault. Well as life opened up, and some things happened, DHR in Limestone county didn't believe us, they didn't even try to look into what happened in Madison County. They kept saying they would talk to me and my husband. NEVER happened. but all of a sudden, these beautiful children are removed from our home. one of my older sons was removed from our home, and labeled as a child sex abuser. His name is on the central registry.  No due process, just bam and a letter so brutal, and labled as fact as if and investigation really did happen. Something that happens and it's just so unreal, you have a hard time believing this is happening in America, where you are innocent until proven guilty. (btw you only are allowed any type of due process if you are a child care professional so some sort foster parents and their families aren't considered professional)  We are now being stabbed in the back, in the most cannibalistic way.  DHR comes into every aspect of your life and family and says \"Here take these broken abused kids, oh they have problems, too bad\" Not only did they not help, they totally threw us under the bus. My younger son still wakes up a year later hoping to wake up to a day of fun with his foster brother then realizes that bed on the other side of the room is empy. DHR Limestone county took our broken family and family we were trying to heal, build and make lasting relationships with. and just threw us under the bus, and didn't even look back. NO DUE PROCESS!  What hurts the most I loved being a foster parent. I LOVED these kids, we as a family all worked so hard together to support them and help each other. Yes I would do it all again, and yes I want to do it again if we ever get this mess cleaned up and find some kind of due process for our son. I don't want to turn away any foster parent but be prepared, document EVERYTHING.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b5f95127461:0x709a947dcfa12a72"}

Someone(supervisor or someone higher up) should b there to handle a case).

So to me it seems like they make up rules as they go because I had to end up contacting another caseworker in a different county to kindly help me understand what was going on with my case who seemed very surprised when I told her that the staff at this facility informed me that the case workers in Lee county only took calls on certain days, even she said that didn t sound right.\n\nClearly these staffs who are employed there thinks that my situation was hilarious.

A representative did recommend The St. Lucie Appraisal Company who was able to use my list of donated items to prepare the personal property appraisal I needed.

It is not a \"charity,\" it is a federally contracted facility. They use their Non-Profit Status as a way to avoid paying income taxes on all the money they get from both you and the government.\nIf you have ever been to any county or state work release you'll know exactly what to expect. All they are worried about is getting you in the door, you finding a job, and you paying 25% of your gross weekly to them.\nIf you are genuinely interested in any form of help I would suggest that you go out and get it on your own.There is one particular agency in town that is willing to offer help, The Family Guidance Center, and they will not allow you to go there.\nIf you are coming from Federal Prison, I would suggest you get insurance. Should you not do that, expect typical Federal Healthcare.\nIf you are trying to remain sober I would figure out a way to get out of there ASAP. You may be able to pull off a meeting here and there, but you are basically allowed one. If you want to get high, just go to the bathroom.\nNot all of the apples there, aka staff, are bad. Some would actually like to see you progress in life. For the rest the job is nothing but a paycheck. The rules vary from shift to shift, person to person, etc. There is no leadership whatsoever, every most all employees think they are the boss.\nThey forget that the only reason they have a job is because of us.if you are going, bring a pen. Take my advice, just remember that you can write them up just like when you were behind the fence. Also you can call the Dismas Corporate Office and speak to the Regional Supervisor, or you can call the Resident Re-entry Manager at Maxwell.\nThe choice is up to you!\n\nSincerely,\nSADIII\n\nPs.

I know this for a fact since I took the volunteer classes but quit because I wanted to offer my time to a service that was about helping find solutions. I also wish they didn't give canned support. When most people are in a crisis situation they would appreciate feedback with optional solutions rather someone on the other line simply responding in a patronizing voice and manner because they really  are waiting for their shift to be over. Crisis center should seriously consider getting wiser,lived experience volunteers who can actually relate to life situations that affect those who aren't mostly focused on getting college credits. Crisis center has the potential to be a great service to folks in need but they should restructure their program. Millinials who can't relate to pass due mortgage,raising teenagers as a single parent, domestic abuse in long term marriage,40 year trauma,and robbing Peter to pay Paul while living off of limited income are not who I want to talk to when I need someone to talk to at 3am on a Saturday because my anxiety won't let me sleep.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891a4e9e5dfca7:0xa29c1dbccd283e03"}

Trying to understand the other without arrogance was what made me understand that they are open to dialogue and that if a person has any complaint or claim they can communicate with them directly, from this small situation we all learned so I feel satisfied, they managed to change my perception without forcing so that says a lot of good things about the type of human resources management that they have.
