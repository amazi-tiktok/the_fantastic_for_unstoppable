My three old son was a teacher's pet and loved his teacher dearly, and she was a fantastic teacher.  After she left the school over some sort of dispute with another teacher we not even informed.  Our son came home deeply upset over the loss of his teacher and began sucking on his shirt while at school (never at home) to cope with the loss.  After about three weeks we begin getting reports that our son was biting and hitting other children, which he has never been aggressive before.  Upon having a meeting with the pastor we were told that there have been multiple situations (which we were never informed of before nor received incident reports) of our son being aggressive. The pastor even said our son had hit someone the previous day, even though the teacher had report that day that he was perfect all day long. The teacher that was assigned to his class has a  daughter who also works there whose son frequently bites and pushes other children.  A friend of ours whose son no longer goes there was catching the blame for the other child's biting. The daughter was suspended (I am assuming) and after her return with her son in our son's class our son now suddenly has a biting problem (which he has never had).  My son's father has walked up upon the boy pushing our son down and after the third time our son went to hit him and his father stopped him, though the teacher was there the whole time and did nothing. After making the decision to change daycares our son came home crying and upset because the teacher would not let anyone play with him do to him going to be going to a new school.  It is deeply saddening when a three year old must stand up for himself because his teacher will not stop bullying and misbehavior to cover up for their grandchild.  It is absurd to let adult teacher to teacher drama be taken out onto a three year child.  If you want a daycare that actually watches what the children are doing, provides a safe and loving atmosphere, and a model environment this NOT the place.

We loved the teachers and that class so much. One morning when he was in the guppy class I was dropping off my son and the lead teacher of sea turtles was opening that class. My son had a blow out so the teacher was changing him and I was standing there helping her. As I\u2019m talking to her she is taking his clothes off and then begins to use his outfit to wipe his stool off his entire body. His outfit ended up having to be thrown away because after three washes it was stained. I mentioned it to the admin and the director and nothing was done. Everything was great until he moved up to the sea turtle class. We did not want him moving up to that class because he was only about 7.5 months old. He wasn\u2019t even crawling, but was attempting to crawl. They kept pushing me to move him up even though I expressed my feelings towards it several times. They stated he was \u201ctoo big\u201d for the guppy class and he couldn\u2019t fit in the swings anymore. He was a 7.5 month old who couldn\u2019t even crawl, in a class full of 1 year olds who are walking. After he moved up to the sea turtle class we started having issues instantly. The lead teacher would tell me what to do and not to do with my son. He came home with three knots on his head over the period of time from when he moved up until this week. Nobody called me to inform me that he had hit his head either. When I picked him up the teachers or admin staff would state they didn\u2019t know how he got the knots and bruises on his head. Also, every day when I pick up my sons nose is crusted with snot. It clearly hadn\u2019t been whipped off all day. His clothes would be covered in the foods they had eaten that day too. Several times I would have to change his clothes and clean him up before leaving because he looked so bad. On many occasions he came home with 3 out of 4 bottles still filled with formula that I had pre made that morning. The teachers would state he refused to eat. Let me mention that my now 10 month old is 27 lbs, he doesn\u2019t miss a meal. When I would pack his bottles up to leave he would get so excited like he wanted one, so I would give him one and he would drink it so fast like he hadn\u2019t eaten all day because he hadn\u2019t. They only gave him one bottle for an entire 10 hours. When my son was close to 9 months old he came home for a week straight throwing up randomly and having bad stools. I finally took him to the doctor thinking he was sick. I came back to the daycare the following week and told his teacher that his doctor said he was fine. That is when I find out that his lead teacher had been giving him whole milk with his formula without asking me or even telling me for an entire week. What if my kid was allergic or I didn\u2019t want him to have milk? The doctor even recommends children not have whole milk till they are a year old. I expressed my feelings towards her stating all my concerns about it and she states in that class they train the children on whole milk. I told her not to give it to him anymore but I would find out from the other teachers that she continued to give it to him. One day I had to pick my son up during nap time for a doctors appt and she told me to shhh that I would wake the children up. Let me mention I was whispering asking how my son was that day. The same teacher has gotten a stern tone with two of the other kids in his class while I was in there talking to her during drop off, so it makes me wonder how she is talking to my son without me there. These are only a few things that have happened. The director was aware but never did anything about it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923c63d1e68f1:0x3f6222559ce30c38"}

I was small and not that tough when I got there but absolutely nothing happened to me like that. I learned so much about life and how to be a person that people would look up to and how to be a leader and live life responsibly. I was there with Col. Bill Jenertte who, even after I Graduated stayed in contact and anytime I was in a fork in the road after I graduated I could call him and if he didn\u2019t answer he would call me back or if he was busy another staff member would call me back and they all remember their students. They saved my life. I graduated as the Battalion Commander and I started there like everyone else, a scrub. I went through leadership trading and left at the top of the ranks. I loved that place so much some weekends when we had the opportunity to go home for open weekend I would choose to stay on campus. And I\u2019m from Destin Florida where it\u2019s warm and I could go on my dads boat and jet skis and have a great weekend but LWMA became a family to me too that some weekends I would want to stay there. If I could say one thing with 100% certainty is that if I never attended LWMA I honestly know I wouldn\u2019t of been able to have the life I have now and I sure wouldn\u2019t know how to live life with character. I live by a cadet code. That is\nTo be faithful, honest, and sincere in every act and purpose and to know honorable failure is better than success by unfairness or cheating.\n\nThat cadet code has made it possible to now own a house and own two charter boats and I also have a 500 Ton captains license. I have a baby on the way and I was just telling my wife that I would love to drive up there this year to visit the campus.\n\nLong story short: Every teenager should go because it would save their lives and the education they would get with the sports and the more one on one with teachers can not compare to any other school in America.

Some reviews were bad and a few were good.  Well, I have decided to share my experience as a parent.  I have been very impressed with the people who help run this school.  I have visited the school and engaged cadets there in open and honest discussion.  I agree, the school can be very difficult for students who are very determined NOT to make an inner change and correct incorrect behavior.  There is a chance that your child may not change, but I feel it is very slim.  Many of the students will tell you that it is not helping them and they have not changed but that is just so that you will bring them back home.  If you stick with it, you will notice a change in behavior regardless of what they will try to tell you.  The school has been very open and honest with me.  Even when the biggest misfortunate event took place this past semester, they kept every parent informed continuously and immediately.  The price is somewhat high, but if you can somehow afford it, even one semester is worth it.  I wish the school was somehow more affordable because there are many young men out here whose lives would be saved and changed for the better.  If you have a troubled teen, you can either do nothing (which can eventually lead to jail or the grave) or you can make an attempt to correct their path and possibly save them.  Sending your kid here does not promise to save your child, but if the worst is eventually going to happen(fate), you would rather look back later and know you did eveything you could have done.  Even though it was a difficult decision to make, I am glad that I sent my son here.  I will more than likely enroll him back into the public school system next semester.  He may not be perfect, but I feel confident that after going to this school this semester, he will not get anywhere close back to the person he was.  If he does, I know the doors of Lyman Ward are still open and the people there will be willing to help.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c633de0bee293:0xb7186d4ccab73737"}

Most of the good ones come from parents who have seen their sons change and learn discipline and respect and attitude and improvements in their grades. Most of the negative ones have come from the cadets themselves though some of these are also positive. I am an alumus of Lyman Ward. To be truthful, I didn't like it when I was there. I hated being uprooted from friends and family and stuck in an all-boys school 100 miles from home. In my case I was sent there because my dad had always wanted to go to a military school when he was growing up so he gave me the opportunity that he never had. (Thanks Dad.) I don't know to this day whether Lyman Ward helped me or not. I was not a bad kid, I didn't get in trouble and I made decent grades. But I know that it helped the vast majority of boys that I went to school with, most of whom had a choice of military school, reform school or juvenile hall.\n\nWhat I know about Lyman Ward is that it's hard. It's hard being taken from everything you know and placed among strangers. I also know this. There are many young men who would not be where they are today if it were not for their parent's courage to send them to Lyman Ward. I also know young men who would not be alive today if not for the discipline of Lyman Ward.\n\nLWMA is an extremely hard experience but most students come out of that school with a love that is hard to explain except for the pride of what they endured and accomplished and the men that they have become.\n\nIf you have a son who is struggling with his life, Lyman Ward may be the answer that you are looking for. I disagree with those who would put their son here for a semester or a year unless they only have one year left. The longer they stay, the more they will grow into young men that you can be proud of.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c633de0bee293:0xb7186d4ccab73737"}

Sometimes we have kids who go here from sixth grade to twelfth. Some of the kids have even been here longer than me.

To make a long story short it was partially my desicion to go . The first day I hated it so much you couldn't understand it was like I was beaten and locked in a room but a few squad leaders and the patlion leader told when you start your a scrub for 28 days and it was honestly horrible i was beaten l. And i kept getting in trouble and wanted to leave. After my 28 days it Sort of mad all sense it was ment to break you down see how much you can take. There was actually very fun memories there it gives you oppertunities to try new things . I played football on a team for the first time. Took tactical tranning and weight lifting. Met some friends that were very nice and still talk to till this day. I was expelled 4 days left for being a dumb ass and picking a fight with someone whom did not deserve it. I was expelled . But the point is last week I thought about it. And you don't realize it while your attending but it was one of the best things to ever happen I didn't realize till a week ago. The on istinct didn't act like a dumbass, didn't do drugs, didn't hang with the wrong people. It was just natrul it just came became a good way of life. I am now 20 years old work as a armed security officer. Starting college in a few weeks and enlisting in the military after college. So again it is a good desicion at the out come.

The decision to enter him into a regular kindergarten program was a big one for us, and after considering several options we chose HCA. Some positives for us as outsiders to the school were the smaller class sizes, education from a Christian worldview, AdvancedEd (formerly SACS) accreditation, location and opportunities to continue his education through high school if desired. The end of my child\u2019s second year is approaching, and all of us (including him) are pleased with our decision to select this school. My son has progressed so much over the last two years, and he is still excited about going to school every day. It is great to experience his teachers\u2019 dedication and love for him and his love for them. He regularly talks about school even after finishing for the day.

It is not necessarily something that can be expressed with words, but must be felt with the soul. The atmosphere was buzzing with energy, enthusiasm, and love. We had found our new home. We were so excited to find out that not only was Stonecreek \"ok\" with parental involvement, but they actually encourage it.

The learning experiences provided by this school, in a small school setting, are remarkable.  There are a couple of things I believe make Stonecreek unique.\n\nFirst of all, its toddler - high school classes are taught using Montessori philosophy and draw on current cognitive research.  The majority of teachers either have IMC or AMS certification.  It is unlike any school I have ever seen for level of attention by the teachers to knowing my children as individuals. My kids learn not only their subjects but also strategies to balance short and long-term projects, study skills, etc., all while being surrounded by high level students performing well in class and on standardized tests. Furthermore, students advance at their own pace although they are pushed as well.  Both my daughters finished algebra before the end of the year, and then they started right into Geometry while in middle school. This allowed them to earn high school credit in 8th grade.\n\nSecond, I have appreciated my daughters coming home and discussing Socratic conversations they have had in class.\n\nThird, my daughters have loved the unique learning opportunities that go well beyond the classroom. Stonecreek students have excelled in these...\n* participating on robotics teams, winning awards all three years\n* earning Duke TIP recognition,\n* winning poetry competitions,\n* receiving regional/national writing awards,\n* being invited to leadership conferences,\n* earning state level debate awards.\n\nMy girls have created meaningful and fun memories from overnight school trips:\n* Cahaba Environmental Center\n* Montessori Model UN in NYC\n* Yosemite\n* Yellowstone (high school trip this spring)\n* Puerto Rico\n* Dismals Canyon\n* Dauphin Island\n* Huntsville Space and Rocket Center\n\nIn short, is Stonecreek going to have the fields and facilities of other private high schools that cost nearly twice as much? No. However, that isn't my main concern for my girls' development.  What they have gotten has been perfect for them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917feeece9269:0x50cdd0f40b0d52b2"}
