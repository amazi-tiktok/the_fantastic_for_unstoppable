They take the time to explain what it takes to fire at the range with ease, and have a cushy waiting area to view a quick training video. The whole process was smooth and easy.\n\nThe range safety officers are well on their game. I felt safe the entire time on the range, and they were able to quickly explain the touch screen track interface, and further explaining that safety is a top priority.\n\nI signed on for 30 minutes, and decided to fire my .40 before testing the shotgun. The touch screen interface has me sold on coming back to bullet and barrel. With just a click, the target goes the exact distance. Takes all the guesswork out of the experience.\n\nI fired my pistol, and was pleased with the range itself. The design is new and clean. And with the RSOs keeping an eye on everything, it's a great environment to enjoy your firearms.\n\nI tried the 88, and it performed beautifully. I added some extra cushion due to a shoulder injury. For those that would ask, you can't shoot bird shot here. But you can fire buck shot and slugs. But I'll tell you, it's fun firing a shotgun at this range.\n\nAfterward I wandered around and struck up conversations with some of the staff, and showed me a selection for sale. I was impressed with the inventory, as well as pricing. I see myself buying my next firearm from here.\n\nFor me, it's a bit of a drive from Madison. But good business is where you find it, and Bullet and Barrel is my newest one stop shop for all things firearms. Plus, open on Sunday!\n\nDont take my word for it, stop in and check them out today! I'll be back soon, keep up the good work guys.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvuz95o_d6-D6-jouQmBd1MO6aeWVF21SXCr48=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1621814100195, "text": "Thank you for coming down!

I always had to call or email them to get any status and the answer was always the same...it will be ready Saturday, it will be ready next week, it will be ready \"sometime next week\".

They never reached out to me. Very frustrating. Now that it is in Jan I have given up working with them and I am now taking the project somewhere else.\n\nI get the feeling that they want to work on things when they feel like it, have no obligation to provide status or time estimate to the customer.

That was indeed the case, but when she came to these shirts, there was some confusion as to which patches were to be applied. As a result, the shirts were not complete when the customer arrived. I have personally spoken with this customer and explained that there was a misunderstanding that resulted in his impression that the shirts were not here and that he had been misled. My offer to him was and is to do whatever I can to make this up to him, including immediately applying these patches at no cost to the shirts he is purchasing online. Understandably, he is quite upset, but my offer will stand and I sincerely hope that given time, he will allow me to rectify this issue and regain his trust as a customer."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626ca3ef951fd1:0xde96c18e5773d091"}
