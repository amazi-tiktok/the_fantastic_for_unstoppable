My thyroid had been killed and I was taking thyroid replacement medicine but my eyes continued to bug out. The pressure was causing headaches which I did not know I should mention. My endocrinologist did not know you could have Graves Disease without double vision (which I didn't get until later). He sent me somewhere for dry eye and that doctor hurried me to Dr. Brown. Brown called in Dr. Ron Swain Jr, who uses 3-D mapping to guide him as he opens a pathway for Dr. Brown's work. They did decompression surgery on both eyes; Brown recommended 12 weeks of I.V. steroids, a therapy that was showing promise at the Mayo Clinic. Three years and several surgeries and procedures later I am reading at 20/20 in both eyes and seeing in full color. So far, so good!

The technician seemed to do a thorough audio test, had a nice sound proof booth that was her office actually.  Told me of a couple of units that would work for me so I tried the cheapest one thinking they are all the same basically sound amplifiers with the ability to amplify the frequencies you have trouble hearing in. Anyway took those home wore them daily but it was not pleasant to wear. I called it an edgy sound that was not natural to me. So I went back trying to tweak them to make them more bearable. They kept falling out of my ears. Didn\u2019t fit properly, and I still missed a lot of words. So I quit wearing them regularly. Finally went back to Costco and asked my technician are these the right ones for me. Did I buy too cheap a pair?  Should I buy a more expensive ones, etc. never really got a clear answer. Always seemed to be these are typical and should help me.\n\nSo after a couple of years suffering with the hearing aids from Costco, I finally went to McCool & Bhuta and met Rachel Lynch. Rachel is a very well trained audiologists. Right away I could tell I had found a true professional that was very knowledgeable concerning hear aids and audio testing. Rachel fit me properly the first time with the right length of in ear speakers that no longer fell out of my ears.  When I first put them on they were not edgy and the sound was very natural. I almost didn\u2019t think they were turned on until she demonstrated how much better I could hear by walking out of site down the hall outside her office.\n\nNow these were more expensive than the Costco but why I ever considered cost to be such an important factor for something that was so critically important, I feel foolish about that.   The ones I have now are rechargeable, can connect to my phone through a Bluetooth connection, and have a nice phone app to change a lot of the setting myself. Thanks Rachel!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197a025ab27b:0xb233d960f87cb84c"}

I was having vertigo attacks, ringing in my right ear along with pressure, and I explained I was having problems listening to people on the phone with my right ear. I took a hearing test at their office before the doctor saw me. Dr. Brocato walked in sat down and told me there was nothing wrong with my hearing and it must be allergies. He prescribed me the most expensive nasal spray on the market and sent me on my way. I suffered for a while and just tried to take different allergy medicines. I then started having more frequent vertigo attacks. A year later I decided something must be going on and asked to be referred to a different ENT.\n\nI have now been diagnosed with Meniere's Disease. In the beginning of the disease there is a period of fluctuating hearing loss. If caught in time there is a chance to save the patients hearing. Thanks to Dr. Brocato overlooking my complaints and not scheduling a follow up visit for me, I now have permanent hearing loss in my right ear at the age of 29.\n\nIt was the worst medical experience I have ever had. He was very casual and treated me like a hypochondriac. We rely on doctors with \"specialties\" to be able to help us when things go wrong.

There's not enough floor space for 5 and nah I'm not going to sit on a dusty carpet floor inch to inch with folks hacking just to see a Dr. for sinus issues. Counterintuitive. Common sense would tell you that anyone good at their practice or caring and about their oath would not subject patients to a space that will literally worsen the conditions they're there with and willing to pay someone to help fix. If this is a purely for profit practice with no sense of compassion I understand business is business; my advice is to work on office space and hire some hard working smiling individuals. Customer service is the beginning and end to all business and if you can't understand that you will never multiply in profit or resources. Simple. Plenty of offices about 30 minutes South, East, and North of here that aren't a scene from an 80s episode of SNL.

I originally went in to see him about sinus issues that were making me miserable. He suggested that I undergo allergy testing. I did and my results revealed that I was allergic to 90% of what I was tested for, and I was severely allergic to most of those. I have started Rush Immunology and I look forward to feeling better in the future! Due to my anatomy (as found on CT Scan) Dr. Robertson recommended surgical intervention, and he performed a Septoplasty on me as well as addressed several other sinus-related issues during the procedure. Yes, post-op pn is never fun, but I am hoping to reap the benefits of the surgery in the near future.\nI cannot thank Dr. Robertson enough as he has been so knowledgeable and helpful in explaining exactly what he feels is going on with my allergy and sinus issues. When I first met him, he came in and sat down and took plenty of time speaking with me...even after being in a long day of surgery. He is never rushed in my appts, and spends a good amount of time explaining things. His staff has also been so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable as well. I appreciate Dr. Robertson and his awesome staff more than they will ever know! Thank you ALL so very much!!!\n(*FYI regarding another review below, the blood test used for allergy testing is NOT AT ALL considered to be the most effective at finding accurate results; research this)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917e64c8d3ea7:0xdc28d0f45952accf"}
