The judge asked me exactly 1 question which was \"do you have anything to say?\". I had a whole list of notes with answers to the prepared questions but was barely given the opportunity to speak. It was never communicated to me that there was missing information or a particular time frame of evidence needed, so I didn't have the opportunity to even try to dig those up. Considering I have been medically neglected my entire life and never able to qualify for insurance when I did attempt employment, of course there are only a few records, and I should have been given the opportunity to find them. Ultimately, I was denied, even though the vocational expert and my medical records confirmed my disabilities and I was ruled medically disabled. I'm all out of options now and resigned to living with my abusive parents until I die old, single, sick, and penniless...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286a6e504acf7:0xab58b2bbe9186190"}

It was an uncontested divorce except for the fact that my ex wanted child support. Well, I didn't know any better, and I knew she wouldn't sign the papers if there was no child support so I agreed to give her what Mr. Campbell had come up with: $400. My ex originally wanted something like $650 per month so I looked at that as a win. Well, after talking with different people who have joint legal and physical custody like I do, they wonder why in the hell am I paying my ex ANY child support, since I have her week on and week off. And, after talking with two different lawyers, they wonder the same thing. The lawyer I have now told me if I'd taken our case to court, the judge would NOT have awarded child support to my ex. We will be going back to court needless to say, will definitely not be using Mr. Campbell who screwed me over.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1450297464686, "text": "Dear Mr. Kemp, I appreciate the opportunity to have assisted with your case, but I do wish you had taken an opportunity to follow up with me about these concerns.  I did leave a message for you to call me concerning this matter, but I have not heard back from you.  I can address your concerns here.  As you might recall, you came to me to fix the agreement that you had tried to file on your own and that the court had rejected.  Without going into the details of the numbers involved with your case (which details are a matter of record) I can confidently say that you would likely have been ordered to pay around $400 per month in child support if you were awarded true joint physical custody after a trial.  If you had tried your case and been awarded joint legal custody, with your wife being awarded sole physical custody, you would have likely been ordered to pay around $650 per month.  Note that there is a difference between joint physical, versus joint legal, custody.  In Alabama, child support must still be calculated, and the judge still must state whether or not Rule 32 has been followed, even in joint physical custody situations.  This means that one party who makes significantly more than the other may still have to pay an amount of child support, and the method used to calculate $400 per month in your case is one that is accepted by the courts.  If two people make the same income, or have an agreement to deviate from guidelines, it is possible to have an order without child support.  Those conditions were not present in your situation.  The alternative would have been to pay me (or another lawyer) much more money to take your case to trial, and make an argument for custody and support, the result of which would not have been a certainty (and could result in less favorable terms of custody and having to pay more support than your agreement).  I'll be glad to explain this to the other persons that have provided feedback to you, as I fear that they must be either misinformed as to the facts or the law.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to assist you, and I will be happy to follow up with you concerning any questions that you have about this matter."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b54406e816d:0xec1834fe93991c53"}

Everyone has the right to post something negative online so this is a safe space for you to vent.  I\u2019ve been doing this for almost 20 years and have seen most everything and dealt with all different types of people.  We tried to reach out to you three times by telephone to figure out what it is that you were upset about but you refuse to answer the phone and actually talk to us.  I guess you are busy working on your complaint to the attorney general\u2019s office and the Alabama State Bar (both of which we welcome you to file by the way - that is your right).  So, let me get this straight - you were visiting Alabama from Texas and you received a speeding ticket. You waited about a month and contacted our law firm to ask for help in handling the ticket.  We responded immediately, gave you the care and concern that you were seeking, went over the process with you and your options.  We quoted you a very reasonable fee and told you what we could do in order to resolve the case.  You told us that was too much and you were going to pay the ticket and move on - obviously that would not be based on our suggestion because we ALWAYS try to avoid a conviction for our clients (and we are a traffic ticket defense law firm... that you contacted for help).  Presumably, before you paid the ticket, you attempted to communicate on your own to try and get the ticket resolved (which every defendant out there has the right to do - only most people would do that first before contacting us but I guess that didn\u2019t occur to you).  You then called us back and were upset because you resolved the ticket on your own\u2026allegedly - after checking, it is clear that no resolution has been entered into the state system.  We love you man - but whatever it is that is troubling you has nothing to do with us - we hope you get whatever it is straightened out.  As for the frivolous complaints you have tried to threaten us with to the Alabama Attorney General\u2019s office and the Alabama State Bar - bring it on.  We fight like hell for ourselves just like we fight like hell for our clients.  And another thing you may want to keep in mind - the goal of resolving a traffic ticket is so that you have no conviction and presumably no public record of it.  But, you sir, have done a great job of creating a public record of it for whatever reason and for the entire world to see.  Best of luck to you.  Joseph C.

We always love and enjoy any type of feedback. We \u2764\ufe0fpublic criticism of our firm because it allows others to see how we handle our business and how we respond and most of all, it causes us to step back and fully analyze a problem or situation to see what happened, where we can improve and it gives us a valuable opportunity to reach out to a client who is clearly hurting and offer support in whatever way we can.\nThe only issue in reaching out to you is that we do not know who you are and this is the first we have heard of any problem such as the one you describe - unfortunately, we do not currently have and have never had a client by the name of Butch Pinkston.  If I personally have an issue with a business, I usually contact the business directly and try to resolve whatever it is that is going on.  Businesses don\u2019t get to make things up or hide behind fake names on the internet - I am as transparent as it gets and all of my actual clients know this.\n*I have been practicing law for 16+ years and have successfully resolved 17,000+ charges for clients over that period of time.  I am a man - through and through - if someone has a problem with me, all they have to do is explain what the issue is and if I have made a mistake, then I am glad to admit the mistake, apologize and fix it.  That is the measure of a man.\nAnyone that knows me and that I have helped knows that I am not a hack, a liar or deceitful - far from it.  If only a successful law practice could be run with a paralegal through text messages - but as you would know if we actually represented you, when someone hires us they are able to text us (and our clients LOVE this option), email us, they get a link to schedule an appointment (at a time convenient for the client) to talk with my staff, they also get a link to schedule an appointment (at a time convenient for the client) with an attorney and also, get our direct dial so all they have to do is call us with a question or issue or to schedule a call with anyone that works for me or an attorney (myself included).\n* You don\u2019t get to the level we are and have the impeccable reputation across Alabama and the country that I have by \u201cpromising everything but delivering nothing.\u201d  Close to 100% of our charges we handle are ultimately dismissed - if that is \u201ccookie-cutter law\u201d then so be it.  Apparently, our clients love having their charges dismissed.  We have the utmost interest in defending cases - our actual clients know this.  Every single time we speak to a potential client or go over case resolutions with our clients, our goal is to develop options with the ultimate goal of having the charge(s) dismissed.  Once we have options on the table, we go over those options and our clients get to decide how to proceed - we don\u2019t force anyone to accept any offer on the table and are always available to continue fighting, take the case to the next level or have a trial.  It is our client\u2019s case and they get to decide.\n* Wow - in your review you said, \u201cI expect this kind of lying, duplicitous BS from the cops and the government but not the people you pay good money to represent you.\u201d  Really?  You expect the cops and the government to lie?  What a sad, sad worldview you have - which explains the many false statements you made while hiding behind a fake name.  I practice law to relieve human suffering - period.  No other reason.  I love people - even the people that choose to post random diatribes attacking me on the internet.\n*I invite anyone reading this or looking for a lawyer to Google my name (Joseph Kreps) and review the info about me and my law firm and all of the great work that we do throughout the State of Alabama for clients located all over the world.

I blew a .11 once I got to the station. What further proof  would they need to charge me with a DUI? How could I possibly get out of that? A  month went by and I still hadn't hired a lawyer. I got to thinking about it and I figured I  would try and find a good DUI attorney to at least provide some good advice before  entering my case single handedly. I then did some research, and happened to stumble  upon Attorney Joseph C Kreps' YouTube videos online that explained what would  happen if I were actually charged with these convictions. They were so enlightening that  I couldn't help but give this guy a call to see if he could help with my case. I gave him a  call & after getting my information & case details\u037e one of the first things his secretary  mentioned was that they may be able to get the sentence reduced to a public  intoxication. I was astounded, thinking there's no way. I was caught dead to rights. I'm  going down. No doubt about it. I then decided to pay the fee and to hire Attorney Joseph  C Kreps' as my DUI Defense Lawyer (not NEAR as high as what I was quoted from  other firms). His very helpful team then guided me through the process of completing a  series of tasks that would help my case. I completed a questionnaire and a few other\nsimple tasks that would, in fact, turn out to help my case tremendously. A month later, I  was scheduled to arrive in court on a Wednesday. On a Monday afternoon prior to my  court date, I received a phone call that explained to me that I wouldn't need to show up  in court on Wednesday and that there was a high possibility that my case was going to  be dismissed. I was absolutely thrilled. How could this happen? I was caught dead to  rights! Two days later I received a phone call and an email from the firm saying that if I  completed a level two CRO, 20 hours of community service, and paid a $600 fine plus  court costs, that all charges were to be dismissed! My entire future was left in the hands  of Attorney Joseph C Kreps, and I couldn't have put it in a better place. I now have no  DUI charges and no open container charges on my record. I'm telling you from  experience, this man and his firm are the absolute best DUI Defense Firm you could  possibly hire for your case. \u00ad If you have a DUI pending \u00ad Stop what you're doing \u00ad Call  this firm.

The cases were not DISMISSED, they were  NOT PROCESSED.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1531931236940, "text": "Brooke:\nThank you so much for removing the false information from your original review.  We don\u2019t want any trouble with you - you know that - but if a review is posted with false information then that is not fair and everyone would agree with that.  We certainly appreciate your comments and your feedback. We always love and enjoy any type of feedback.  We \u2764\ufe0f public criticism of our firm because it allows others to see how we handle our business and how we respond and most of all, it causes us to step back and fully analyze a problem or situation to see what happened, where we can improve and it gives us a valuable opportunity to reach out to a client who is clearly hurting and offer support in whatever way we can.\nWe never claim to be perfect and certainly don't want anyone to think that we are perfect.  As you know, Brooke, we did not represent you. \u00a0We represented your partner who is going through the immigration process in the United States of America. We take great pride in the knowledge and the experience that we have over the last 15+ years in handling and resolving 13,000\u001e+ charges all over the State of Alabama. When I was made aware of these issues, we reached out to you to try to resolve it within hours and on the next business morning 7-18-18.  When we did reach out ASAP, you went on and on and then hung up on us before we could even talk.  We tried to call back to no avail.  I personally tried to call back to no avail.\nThe first and most important thing that I would like to point out is that BOTH of the actual client\u2019s charges were DISMISSED.  And it wasn\u2019t just a \u201ctraffic ticket\u201d.  He had 2 charges one of which was failure to obey police/fireman.  Immigration is a difficult process and who knows how this could have seriously impacted his immigration issues - that process and system is ALWAYS CHANGING as everyone knows\u2026 but it shouldn\u2019t impact him now because we got BOTH OF HIS CHARGES DISMISSED \ud83d\ude09!\nAs to the class that was required of him, we are sorry that his time was taken from him in order to do that - our main concern was and is his immigration status and getting the charges dismissed.  His completing a class while his lawyers worked through issues beyond anyone\u2019s control seems like a small price to pay to continue the long and difficult process of becoming a legal United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Citizen.\nIt is important for anyone reading this to know that we did email you the DISMISSAL disposition of BOTH CHARGES back in March 2018... and heard not a peep out of you until this review surfaced almost 4.5 months later.  It is baffling.  We love deeply and dearly every single one of our clients and their friends and family including your partner and also you, Brooke. \u00a0We still love you no matter you might post about us.  This is the truth because our love for our clients and our love and passion for our work and the system is not dependent on how others think or feel about us because we know the truth and our love is our love no matter what - it\u2019s just who we are.\nI invite anyone reading this or looking for a lawyer to Google my name (Joseph Kreps) at any time and see all of the great information about me and my law firm and all of the great work that we do throughout the State of Alabama. \u00a0I stand by my work and the work of everyone who is on my team.  We love what we do because we love people and we love to help people - it\u2019s why I am alive and why I was put on this earth and called to do this type of work.\nMuch love to you, Brooke, and your partner.  If you change your mind and desire to speak to me then I am always here and always willing to talk.  If you or any family members need our help again in the future, please let us know as we would be honored to assist and help you with anything that comes up.\nJoseph C.

But this is the behavior that is typical of many businesses in the north central region of Alabama. Once the better business bureau is contacted, however, maybe they will change their tone.\n\nIf she had not contacted the actual courthouse to get her court date, she would not have even known of the impending court date. After calling these people several times, they refused to give her any of her case details.\n\nSo with regard to the other negative review this institution has received, I do NOT agree with the owner that \"it is the work of a competitor.\" I have seen these practices first-hand, and I am far from a capital seeking adversary.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594754666809, "text": "Because we don't recognize your name and you don't appear to be a client of our firm, based off your screen name, there's no way for us to address this issue without knowing the exact name of the client.

Over the years, the lawyers and staff of our firm have also volunteered countless hours of their personal time participating in charities and outreach programs that benefit all segments of our community.\n\nAlthough we're respectful of your opinion, the assertions you've made about the issue of race are reckless and inaccurate and thats clearly proven by 17 years of close relationships with people of all genders, races and socio-economic statuses that are repeat clients. Many people leaving reviews on this very site are \"people of color\" and would strongly disagree with your statement and actually take offense to it. Writing a negative review about a business that's never represented you is one thing but making baseless accusations of racial unfairness about people you don't know and who have spent their careers representing underprivileged segments of our state and communities is something else.\n\nIf your mother is dissatisfied with any service that any lawyer or staff member of our firm has ever provided, then please have your mother, personally, reach out immediately and ask for the head practice manager so that we can rectify this matter.\n\nWe take any client dis-satisfaction very seriously and want every client to be satisfied with our efforts.

This harrowing experience began for my family and I around the end of August of 2018 when my beloved uncle died unexpectedly. We began paperwork for me to administer estate by which this process has been grossly bumbled through and fumbled 95% of the time. Mrs. Shoen didn't keep my family and I updated as to the status of the case and judges wishes at any point in time. Nor did she even bother to let us know that court dates had been canceled due to heirs requests for extension. Nor did she return our phone calls or emails in a timely manner despite being paid $1000 up front to get started on our case. Then she all of a sudden calls me hurriedly around Thanksgiving black Friday  to request the remaining funds due to be paid which was not in line with our original verbal agreement. I contested her request and the amount was decreased to $228 with the remaining to be paid after estate opening. After this scenario, things all seemed to go downhill rapidly.  Heirs we calling my family with information from probate we had no knowledge of despite having hired Kayla to be our representative which was disheartening and also very stressful. To date we have had 3 canceled court dates on technicality of not having all necessary actions completed prior to court by my attorney. My last court date was June 26 at 2pm by which I spent the entire month or so prior trying to contact Kayla for confirmation and a check in to ensure our readiness to move forward. My calls and texts were not answered and\nI never heard anything back from her. Not even a return email was received until the day before the court date. Mrs. Shoen apologized in her email for her gross negligence in handling my uncle's case and said she had closed her practice and that she was withdrawing herself from my case and mailing my case file and a refund check for all money's paid back to me. I spoke with her about this on June 25th. I asked that she send me the USPS confirmation so that I could follow up on the file and refund myself, but she never sent it. Today it is July 5, 2019 and I still have not received anything by mail as promised and also no response to my follow up email...Throughout all this long drawn out process my mom has fallen Ill and lost 40lbs due to stress. To boot, I am dealing with my own distinct stresses in trying to get this estate resolved for my mom because my uncle was her best and only close friend.  I know Kayla may not understand this because it isn't her family or her mom. I understand that Mrs Shoen has been dealing with quiet a few deeply challenging issues of her own here lately and that's why I've been so lenient as I know she is probably still learning how to juggle lifes difficulties simultaneously with lifes obligations and workplace responsibilities. I have compassion for her and truly wish her the best in life but there was left much to be desired from the very minimal level of care attention and concern given to our case. I just wish I would known this before hand as my mom and I have wasted an entire year and still have yet to even get the estate opened. I'm so disappointed, stressed and literally exhausted from this process and dealing with lackadaisical representation has made this process the most cumbersome experience ever. At least when I finally get the file and refund I can move on with my life. I pray and wish I had had the same positive experience as some others have had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb093ee5187:0x87380fb81b949ade"}

I'm 48 yrs old and I felt that my case was going to be a difficult one to prove. There were 2 reasons why I thought the judge's decision would be unfavorable; my age and my disability weren't supported by any medical documentation, such as X-ray's, CT-scans, Ultrasounds. Plus, the treatment for my condition was the cause of my condition. I was suffering from other conditions that had been documented over the years by several physicians in various disciplines. Atty Cox wanted to focus primarily on Abdominal & Pelvic Adhesive Disease as the culprit, and casually mention the other conditions. Yes, I was concerned with her thought process due to the fact this condition had the least amount of supporting medical documentation. In that moment I agreed, she was the professional and because she had worked for the  Social Security Administration in the administrative law division.  It was called the Office of Hearings and Appeals at the time.  She had received extensive legal training on the Social Security Act and the Code of Federal Regulations. Also, she had received medical training to learn medical terminology, as well as about injuries and disease processes that can interfere with a person's ability to hold a job. We filed my appeal July 2016 and my hearing Sept 2018. During the hearing with ADJ the ruling was favorable. I haven't seen a dime yet but I know it's coming. Attorney Cox's and her team knows their stuff, trust them and they will get it done for you. Anytime I felt unsure I would call or email, they always replied timely. Also, you as a client have to be thorough in making sure that the physician has noted your conditions in your medical file and request a copy of medical notes, lab reports and any tests that are taken for your personal file and make copy for attorney.

Randall worked with us financially because travel cost to and from court, time out of work and hotel expenses. Randall pleaded with the judge for us not having to go to court when not necessary because of travel distance from Amarillo. Instead, Randall represented us everytime and was Our Voice in court when we weren't present. Every time after a court hearing, more and more worked in our favor. He convinced the judge if one more slip up from my wife's ex then our daughter (my step daughter) would come back home to Amarillo,Texas on a one way ticket permanently. Better yet, our daughter and her father moved back to Texas in fear of losing custody. Randall was outstanding and Mary(his assistant) was So Extremely Friendly. Both Down to Earth!

After you have gone through the fire of a difficult, highly technical or highly-important legal battle with him, you will come to love him and appreciate him just as I do.  I cannot say enough about Mr. Chris Money to explain just how incredible he is.   Do yourself a favor, if you are facing a legal matter that requires the service of an attorney, don't waste your time with anyone else.  Call Mr. Chris immediately and schedule a consultation with him today.  Before you leave his office in Abbeville, Alabama, you will realise that this man is different from other attorneys and that your case and situation matters to him.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d5fc71068ae83:0x29a11c2fe72db8c3"}

As I am sitting there explaining to Mr. Thomas why I am there seeking hes services he was more interested in picking the sores on his leg then paying any attention to anything i had to say, and while he was showing me the bruises from his recent jet ski accident all he could tell me was to seek an attorney immediately. I believe that's what I am here. What he ment was i needed a court appointed attorney because I could not afford him. So with Very unprofessional! My family has dealt with Powell Law firm for many years my aunt has know Mr. Thomas sence hes graduation year in 07. They have been wonderful people always willing to help with a smile. till now. So with no help from Mr. Thomas all I can do now is sit back and hope a friend doesn't pass away in lockup because she has a rare condition that causes her to have seizures. I am so disappointed in the actions of Mr. Thomas and the rudeness of the employees at Powell Law Firm.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a05391561af1d:0xe79b710db5737374"}

My 87 yr old Grandmother was recommended to hire Mr. Brown to compose a will for her. She was quoted $150 dollars by Mr. Brown for a will. She was quoted by Mr. Brown's secretary $150 dollars for a will. When Mr. Brown completed the simple 2 page will he gave my Grandmother a bill for $225 dollars. My Grandmother is on a fixed Social Security income and had to save 2 months to pay the original quoted price of $150. She offered that $150 to Mr. Brown and he rejected it and took her completed will back to his office. Now my Grandmother is without a will again. I would not recommend this office to anyone else.

Personally, I don't know where I would be without Elizabeth Zwiebel being my divorce lawyer. My case started with me being served papers that said my former husband wanted custody of our children. Out of the blue. Without warning I was forced to fight for my children. I could not believe what I was reading. I have always been the full time caregiver for my children. It was astounding to read the words on that paper. Elizabeth greeted me with open arms and understanding words. She explained to me how to best proceed. Her rates were very reasonable especially since I had to hire her on the spot for a hearing in 3 days. She was fantastic in the court room.  Her command of the facts and her preparation was absolutely evident. She knew every detail. She used every bit of the information I gave her to win my case. Without her I don't know where I would be - probably without my children. It was very overwhelming. Her retainer was a no brainer. My family helped me but it was worth every penny. My former husband was way too confident which worked on every single nerve in my body. She told me what was going to happen and every single thing she said happened. It was great to see her work.

They are last ditch efforts after a criminal defendant has been convicted and their appeals denied.  Statistically they have some of the lowest possibility of success in the criminal justice system.  The only thing Eversole Law ever promises anyone is that we will do everything we can to help our clients in any way we can.  And Mr. Richardson, Steven Eversole did not represent your brother, but another attorney in the firm.   You should know that.  Either way,  Mr. Eversole has has great success filing Rule 32 and other post-conviction relief measures for clients, but nothing is ever guaranteed. In 2014 Mr. Eversole himself overturned 287 life sentences and over 2000 years sentence in one case.  In 2013 he overturned a sex crime conviction with life time registration  with an out-of-time Rule 32 Petition in a 26 year old case.  In 2015 Mr. Eversole overturned a several year old drug conviction with another out-of-time Rule 32 Petition.  And again in 2016 Mr. Eversole overturned a 2010, 20 year sentence on a drug trafficking conviction that released our client 15 years earlier on a post conviction relief measure.  And these are just a small accounting of his success.

Roberts is an African American as myself and I feel enriched and blessed to have a firmly established, very educated without question, a sharp attorney \"who represents justice for all\" but makes me proud for testimony; he truly represents the \"black community, in a quality image\". From one African American male to another, both  having Master Degrees Criminology/ Criminal Justice, I respect you sir. One noble undertaking is his lighting quick response in calling you back. Meeting him you might not be sure if he is an attorney or pastor with the extremely sharp increase look of professionalism, yet with a personification of spirituality (bishop Roberts} lol.  So if I said  dam, I would be safe; it  meaning water dam. lolllllllllll. Should I say Amen, or what's up man. lolllll The office also gives you a feel of , I'm in the right direction. I recognize the fundamental principles, hard work, and the possessed skills to have a Masters Degree, and it is a cemented foundation when dealing with the much more complex criminal justice system. The great ideal person to navigate you through this process is attorney Roberts. Sitting in the office a thought popped in my mind as if I were the rebirth of Einstein   \"Faith is not Faith until there is nothing else to do\". The legendary Johnny Cochran is no longer with us; but I believe attorney Roberts is the link in the positive outcome of faith per Cochran. Roberts is an upstanding individual with a soft landing way of articulating questions and answers. He takes a solidified position, with a mental alertness of impressive response. Hedi, is the  secretary who immediately responds to the main mission of achieved information for the Roberts law firm. She carries clout with me because she is very professional and a matured vital link in centerpiece concerns. She is properly focuses on the positively  best moral image and performance contribution of case. Roberts and Hedi, look like models to me. loll. My respected viewers, across the broad spectrum, this law firm has a genuine care of/for your represented best. I had to say more, being retired Navy, one of my embodiment talents is writing and talking. You feel a comfort zone, like you knew him already. Eric, your wife is so pretty in the wedding pictures, and you two compliment, and I'm sure complete each other with guiding principles of love, respect, and equally yoked intelligence. I did not know you were Hollywood in Jet magazine.  I wanted to say we played football together and you was the backup quarterback to me. lollllllllllx 100. Hedi look sooo sexy in that dress in web site pictures.  Dammm she does, Beyonc\u00e9 level sexy. Eric, I am proud of you and firm, and if I can do anything to help I will. Put up more awards and Hedi in those dresses. lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll.  I had to zoom in on pictures.   In the criminal justice field a match in identification is essential.  Spinning around in the computer chair, I  jumped up sayings, that's them. lolllllllllllll. Loyal. This is fun, I add more each time I visit this page. I need to stop, you have to meet him to understand. He talk really mellow, mild,  soothing.

When I was faced with mine in 2019, I was referred to Dani Bone through a coworker and friend that I trusted. I initially hired Dani because I heard he was the very best and he would fight for me. I called and even though they were extremely busy, they saw me right away. After hearing my situation, Dani was honest with me and said, \"You need Sam. \" My case was very complicated having both personal and business issues, assets and properties to divide, custody and other court issues . Sam took it as a challenge. He stayed with me and guided me through the whole divorce process. It was not easy, it was extremely tough but Sam knew how to handle every situation that came up. When going through a 2 yr battle, you need to know and  feel confident that your attorney has your back and has your best interest at heart. I emotionally fell apart many times and he helped me to learn to stand up for myself and it made me a stronger person through this process. All I wanted was what was fair- he got me exactly what I asked for! I was extremly pleased with services of Sam, Dani and their dedicated and caring staff. Amanda, Fredrick and Osha were just wonderful to work with. The whole staff made me feel comfortable and at ease through a very uncomfortable life circumstance.  While the other party had 5 attorneys through the process , I had one.  I only needed the one team- I had The Best with Sam & Dani Bone. Sam was honest, upfront, bold and encouraging. He never had to be ugly or raise his voice in court or trial and never once belittled anyone. I recall him saying, \"It doesn't have to be ugly\". Being a Christian, a professional, a self employed woman, a Realtor and a mother of 2, this was imperative to me. Sam treated both parties with total RESPECT always . That was very important to me.  I did my part and provided the true facts, evidence and proof- he did his part and presented my case with true professionalism , Integrity and no one was disrespected in the process. I would \ud83d\udcaf percent recommend Sam & Dani Bone if you want to be represented by someone who will always have your back and is not afraid to fight for your best interest.

I no longer lived in Alabama and was unsure of where to turn for legal advice. After consulting with Mr. Sam Bone, it was clear that he had a deep understanding of law and how it applied to my particular situation.\n\nMany attorneys will promise the moon, without being able to deliver a star. Sam will be honest about your case, talk with you about the possibilities, and develop a plan to protect your best interests. Phone calls/emails are answered promptly and you are made aware of appointments and court actions. Even though my case was regular family law issues, it was treated as a priority.\n\nWhen emotions run high and people play dirty, you need an attorney that will keep you focused. It was nothing short of a blessing to have Sam\u2019s counsel during this time. Sam will listen and use what will benefit your case most, helping you to make the best decisions.\n\nThrough my experience, I learned that Sam is wise beyond his years and holds a unique combination of qualities that make him an excellent attorney. He is a younger lawyer in comparison to many of the veterans in the area, but his expertise speaks through shrewd discernment, both in and outside the courtroom.\n\nIn retrospect, I know that employing a professional, well-versed attorney who gave honest legal advice was a valuable asset to me. My case only involved family law, but I would recommend Sam Bone in every area that he practices.

When I finally met with  Mr. Gatch the next day I was still a little skeptical of his services but none the less I heard him out. I came to him with an extremely complicated case, and told him that I would not hire him unless if he could meet all of my demands which were very time constrained due to the nature of the emergency that I presented him with. He informed me of his experience and explained to me the course of action he would take with clear and specific details which made it easy to comprehend. He understood the seriousness of my consternation, and assured me that he would get to work right away.  Over the next couple of days I saw him in action, and began to realize that his reputation clearly precedes him. WITHIN 3 BUSINESS DAYS AFTER HIRING HIM, he accomplished all of my demands with personalized, flawless, and expedited results that worked out in my favor. Not only does he have a very high work ethic but he is also a master of his trade. He holds a level superiority in his field that delivers comfort to his clients through his knowledge, confidence, experience, and professionalism. Mr. Gatch understands the importance of networking with locals of various communities regardless of what county he's in. He maintains an image that gives him uncontested credibility that promotes favorability and popularity amongst citizens, peers, and judges alike. His communication with me during the entire process was constant, and his responses from inquiries that I had were immediate, whether it was through text, email, or phone call. He stayed engaged with me through the entire evolution of my case which ensured security from any feelings of doubt or anxiety I had to help keep me focused. The sincerity of his character establishes a genuine rapport that connected with me on a fundamental level which most attorneys lack in these days to be honest. Mr. Gatch is a formidable man against the complexities of the law which places him in a league of his own against the competition, and I have to say... it really inspired me. His dependability, tact, integrity, loyalty, and bearing are just a few of the traits that I witnessed, and as a former Sergeant and combat veteran of the United States Marine Corps these are just a few of the traits that we live by to serve our country. His services are no different which are always in the best interest of the client. If you're looking for someone to deliver you results in regards to the law...Look no further because David Gatch is a person who goes above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nAnd if you're wondering what the emergency of my case was...it was a petition for emergency custody of my daughter, and a motion to domesticate a foreign judgement from the state of California.

Although I've spent more years in college than any attorney I still can't comprehend the complex processes lawyers hide behind to try and make a JD seem worth more than a PHd.

We chose Tim since he was  a member of our legal plan to represent us in a civil case. After telling us that the plan would not cover our case, we paid Tim a $2500 retainer. During this time Tim would be proactive and mail us copies of whatever documents he would send or file with the courts. I looked over our legal plan and found that his charges should have, in fact, been covered by our plan.Our legal plan's counse determined that this was so and advised Tim of the same. Since being notified that his time would be covered by the plan and  to not use my retainer for covered charges, I stopped getting any correspondence from his office. No copies of any documents,  no phone calls, no more updates, nothing. Tim never even told us that there was a hearing for summary judgement. The  only reason we found out was from a copy of the order from the  court, itself.  After the hearing, we found out that Tim didn't even argue our case as we had discussed. We eventually lost our case. Tim didn't even bother to notify us until over a week later. When asked about our options, Tim determined that he no longer wanted to represent us and referred us to another attorney who wouldn't even return our calls. When asked about the refund of the $2500 retainer, Tim put us off for over 6 weeks until he finally acknowledged he was trying to \"come up\" with the money. Our legal plan counsel had also been contacting him to return our retainer without further delay. Throughout this time and during our case Tim would never initiate contact with us. We had to initiate contact with him. Even then, it would take anywhere from a week and a half to a month before he would respond.  Tim eventually decided after 46 days that he was no longer going to refund our money despite knowing that his charges were covered by our plan. I have yet to get a breakdown of how my retainer was spent, much less anything else. I would never refer him to anyone. Now he is running for circuit court judge. If Tim is representative of our judicial and legal system, then we, as citizens, have very little when it comes to faith in our legal system.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889227564f164c7:0x27248d728f74b2d4"}

I met him in an elevator at the courthouse and then asked some of the clerks about him. They all knew him and had great things to say about him. That is one of the reasons I chose him.. I didnt want a lawyer who stays in his cushy office all day. I wanted someone who is in the courthouse fighting for his clients. I highly recommend Chris! Oh, and I just saw that some guy left bad feedback because he said Chris charges an initial consult fee. I dont know if that is true, but my initial consultation was in an elevator. I was at the courthouse because I was planning to fight it myself to save legal fees. After we got off the elevator, chris talked with me for at least a half hour and told me exactly what to do to file it myself. After talking with him and hearing his incredibly reasonable price, I was so relieved to be able to afford him and not have to do it myself. I had spoken with another attorney that morning, and he wanted almost ten times the price, which is why I had decided to do it myself. So, the implication that Chris is money hungry is just not true in my experience. (I actually came back and edited my review after reading what that guy wrote). Even if he does charge an initial fee (I dont know), it would be worth it, because I guarantee you will walk out of his office knowing exactly the best course of action, and that kind of peace of mind is priceless.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b56b77d59a3:0x4f78684003cc4ed3"}

None of this is what really upsets me, what upsets me is that from day one they have lead her believe that she is going to receive a minimum of $2,000,000. I have done several hours of research getting the background on the lawsuits filed for the same reason she filed hers. First off I have not even seen the name Cory Watson Attorneys mentioned in any of the reports. Secondly there appears to be over 10,000 people file suite for the same exact reason, against the same exact company, with several law firms. The litigation for this particular devise has been going on for many years. And, it would appear by all indications she will probably never be paid one penny. To this day, they never contact her, if she contacts them they tell her they expect some kind of payout soon, and they are still insisting that it will be $2,000,000+ Why would they cntinue to lie to her?

I would describe him as incompetent, but it actually seemed worse than incompetence: he didn't believe me and he was deferring to the prosecutor's (his opponent) side. Though there clearly was some incompetence at play. Mr. Sogol told me that if I got into a pre-trial diversion program that my record would be expunged after completing it. However, I looked it up and the alleged offense for which I was arrested CANNOT be expunged under Alabama law, though I plan to litigate that issue when the time is right.

I emailed her about it and she told me to email the Mom's attorney (unprofessional), I did so and copied her. A few days past and I never heard anything back so I emailed her again, she then told me it was not on the agreement made between them and sent the paper work I had sent her and the Mom's attorney. I told her I was confused, it was at the bottom right of the 2nd page, to which she replied oh I see now-ok, I will get an amendment filed. The next day, I asked her if she had reached out to Mom's attorney and she replied: Respectfully, there is no need to send ongoing emails, she said she would only communicate with my son going forward. She never even said she was sorry for messing up the papers 3 separate times. When we hired her, I explained that we knew we were not her only clients but this was very important to us.

It took him 3 hours to get it straightened out. I would NOT recommend her to ANYONE. Respect goes both ways.

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.

The level of stress in my daily life was extremely high, to say the least, due to this situation and these concerns.\n\nI was referred to the Law Office(s) of Russell W.

For more serious crimes, you may get a public defender, but your life is on the line with someone who may not care about you or what happens to you.  It's a dangerous risk to take and once you are convicted, it's harder to find people to listen to you.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1541428090094, "text": "How kind of you. Thank you.

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

Mr. Crumbley is the most exceptional, top notch attorney in the area and will exceed your expectations each and every time under his representation. He has represented me on 4 separate cases (3 misdemeanor and 1 felony) and has impressed me more and more each time with his results with all 4 of the cases being dismissed with NOT GUILTY verdicts when I was very GUILTY as a matter of fact. As soon as he walks in the courtroom you should know that you will be taken care of. This mans representation is like the results of having the combination of Peyton Manning in the regular season and Tom Brady in the playoffs which in other words is about as good as is gets when in comes to criminal defense representation. I honestly do not have enough words or ways that I can use to describe how high level of an attorney he is and worth every dollar of the premium cost to afford him to represent you because you get what you pay for so you won\u2019t be disappointed no matter how guilty you are of your charges. Don\u2019t hesitate to call his office as they are more than happy to assist you with whatever questions or concerns you may have in regards to your case. Mr. Crumbley is hands down the best attorney in our area for any criminal matters. Do yourself a favor and make sure you hire him to take care of yourself because I\u2019d honestly be hesitant to have anybody else to represent me in a potential criminal defense situation besides Mr. Crumbley. To Teles Walker, you won\u2019t find a better attorney or receive a better result than having Mr. Crumbley by your side and am sure you received a contract as Mr. Crumbley is always sure to provide one so everyone out there should disregard any negative reviews because those folks are more than likely either trolls or generally unhappy with their own lives and you can tell the literacy of the individual by reading their review from a grammatical standpoint. To the rest of the folks out there, be sure to disregard the ignorant individuals reviews as that is a false representation of Mr. Crumbleys services. As GUILTY as any individual may be, I can guarantee that you will receive the best possible legal result with Mr. Crumbley by your side and I say that with no doubt in mind. There is a good reason as to why you see his billboards all around our area and it\u2019s for his consistently exceptional results.

EVERYTHING must be ALWAYS viewed with the proper perspective. I appreciate your strong, heartfelt words but they weren't necessary. We take cases all across the board and that includes cases that are very difficult and filled with a multitude of considerations, possibilities and opportunities - even for failure.

However, every case is different and has it's own variables, nuances and circumstances (both in fact and in law).

This  event started in 2020 and finally resolved in spring of 2021.    The response from the members on his team has been pathetic at best.  Not returning phone calls or emails so many times.  I would have to follow up several times to make sure what I had requested was being done on various issues.   We have been told incorrect information during probate causing us a lot of extra work when it wasn't required.   Then at closing, I had to point out several items that were not correct and even the fee we were told to pay wasn't correct.  Actually, the fee was short from what was discussed and we corrected saving them a loss.   The lawyer did not seem to know the details of the closing when we pointed out discrepancies and had to go ask his staff.   The front office lady was very sweet and helpful.  However, the remaining staff we dealt with was unorganized and unprofessional.   For the amount we paid,  we feel we did not receive good service as the process and experience was difficult and frustrating throughout.   Then we still have one outstanding matter we asked for them to provide legal documents on and  over a month has passed with no communication from the office.   I have followed up 3 times and still no response.     I thought a small town attorney office would have been a very good experience to work with, but I was wrong.   I would not recommend.

What started out as a simple consultation to learn what my rights would be if divorce became real would ultimately become a saving grace.\n\nIf I had to describe Mr. Matthews I would say he is a very straight shooter that will not try to sell you \"hopes and dreams\" or \"blow smoke\" just to get money out of you. He will definitely let you know where you stand and how things are, and believe me sometimes that is definitely what you need even if you may not want to hear it.\n\nAnother thing about Mr. Matthews I can say is that he has the experience and know how to go about your case. He knows the exact moment and places to strike to when it matters the most. In my own situation, Mr. Matthews delivered such an amazing defense in an emergency hearing that at that exact moment after nearly a year of feeling beaten, battered, bruised and so tired that I was about ready to give up. He managed to unravel my now ex-wife's entire testimony with just a single question. Mr. Matthews did such a good job that after a few follow up questions the judge stopped the hearing, and I didn't even have to get on the stand to defend myself.\n\nThen a few weeks later Mediation came around, and the tone suddenly shifted from everything my ex-wife wanted to pretty much everything I wanted. I have to thank Mr. Matthews so much because thanks to him and his amazing defense I now have my name cleared, and I can be the father to my children that I always wanted to be.\n\nI also want to extend a thank you to Mr. Matthews team. You will not find a more friendly and knowledgeable staff that is prompt with informing Mr. Matthews of your concerns and questions, and getting that information back to you.\n\nSo if what your looking for is an hometown attorney that won't steer you wrong, won't try to sell you a line, and give you a true blue unquestionable defense then  look no further than Mr. William Matthews.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b6820dacf57:0x2d7964e50605b3ad"}

The day after my accident, on a Saturday, Dean met me at Starbucks to discuss my case.  I am sure He handles cases involving much more money than my case, yet his helpfulness, guidance & availability to me in the weeks following my accident were stellar. 1st, I would not have gotten a car rental from the insurance company of the driver that caused my accident after mine was totaled without Dean's help/guidance. 2nd,  I texted his personal cell phone on a Saturday night after arriving at home to a high anxiety causing letter from the insurance company of the person that caused my accident.  Dean replied within 5 minutes, and with great interest in my inquiry! Asking questions i hadn't thought of in order to fully understand my status & give the most accurate reply. I was put very much at ease. 3rd, I stopped into Dean's office the 1st time unannounced by text, phone or email.  I had multiple questions ranging from money to get my stitches removed to whether I needed to obtain a police report and wanted only to speak to the staff member in charge of my case.  Before I could finish saying my name to the receptionist, Dean exited his office and greeted me. And although he had a meeting in 20 minutes & i offered to just ask a staff member, he wouldn't leave until all of my 5 or 6 questions were personally answered.  4th, Attorney Derek Siebert, in charge of my case, did a phenomenal job for me.  He contacted me multiple times to explain my options & offer opinion if I desired. He was truly in my corner for me.  Lastly, but very very impressive to me, every member of Dean's staff i had any interaction with treated me with great courtesy & with professionalism.  I felt very & truly cared for as a client.

False advertisement Really!! My true story: My now ex husband and I went through a chaotic divorce and his lawyer was Mr. McGhee. My experience is based on what I dealt with in phone and email conversations as well as what was told to me by my ex husband and McGhee's  Secretary and how the divorce was handled. First Mr. Mcghee, does not like to speak to people that are \"Pro Se\" (representing yourself) so even though you worked for over 10 years in the law field as a paralegal and you can easily save your money by doing the settlement and divorce yourself, Shawn McGhee will make sure to give you a hard time. Not only does he lie and says there is a conflict of interest, which is why he won't speak to you which by the way, THAT IS NOT TRUE, but he will not answer any of the calls. For whatever reason he was not able to speak to me which to me seems very unprofessional, he would often have his secretary let me know what was needed for the divorce to be settled. I think because I do know what I needed to do legally, and trust me lawyers hate people that have worked in law fields you cant pull a sheet over legal assistants or paralegals eyes easily, we know all the tricks.  Now his secretary had given me some information that had holes in what she said that included the discovery process and hearings as well as the laws. Because of the communication between me and her and then what she told my ex husband of what I said, which were twisted, this made the divorce messy and long . And I believe the reason was for trial which is very expensive, but lawyers love expensive. Now one thing which is grounds for a grievance is that Mr. McGhee gave advice on the amount of payments for child support that should be paid which is unethical and should only be done by a referee. Mr. Mcghee, has no compassion for children as he informs his clients that they don't need to be responsible parents and pay for the kids until a judge says so, which to me makes me wonder about his character. Being out of state I was not able to do much, and my ex did not even live in Alabama as law requires in order to file but as usual somehow McGhee got around that. I have worked for law firms since I was 16 years old I could never work for someone that does things that are unethical, shady and down right wrong  he has no moral character, and I would be scared if my papers would be questioned by a judge with the amount of lies that my ex and his lawyer gave to me.  Please look at other Law firms that will look at your case and care enough to not control your decisions and won't run up your bill for no reason. Me and my ex husband  managed to settle together without the hearsay talk of his lawyer. The issue I have is there are amazing lawyers out there and Mr. Mcghee is the reason that lawyers have such a bad reputation. Make sure you chose a lawyer that will care about your interests and especially the kids, don't let the kids get lost in the divorce they are the most important thing, don't let the lawyer stress you or the other party or you will cause more harm and extend something that is not good for anyone. And make sure to hold your ground. Research on your lawyer don't chose someone because they are cheap eventually they will show you why they are cheap, Mr. Mcghee was affordable for my ex-husband until hearings and trial came around and then up goes his hourly.
