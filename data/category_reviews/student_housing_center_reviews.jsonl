It is the Buyers responsibility to obtain a copy of the covenants for a neighborhood and to understand them before purchasing.  The Realtor typically provides these to the Buyer.  Once we are made aware of the purchase and the new owners contact information, we send a welcome packet in the mail that includes the covenants.  We also provide an Owner Portal that has all of the Association documents for owner to access.  Spaces is not \"pocketing money from everyone\".  Spaces is paid a set Management Fee by the Association to handle all of the management and administrative tasks for the Association to operate.  This includes paying all Association bills, working with and overseeing vendors, answering Owner, Realtor, lender, and closing attorney questions, creating financials statements, reconciling the bank accounts, administering quarterly and annual meetings, etc.  The annual budget is set by the Board of Directors and is then presented to all Owners to vote to ratify at the Annual Members Meeting.  Spaces then operates the Association within that budget for the year.  Spaces provides regular financial statements to the Board, and approved financial statements are available to all Owners.

For those who do not want restrictive covenants where they live, we recommend looking for homes located in the county or finding a neighborhood that does not have restrictive covenants."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83230c148df:0xaac2293f184926e6"}

We did not write them, but they do create a fiduciary responsibility for the Board to make sure they are enforced, which is what we are hired to do.  We cannot speak to how the Association was operated previously, but a primary reason we are hired is to provide covenant enforcement for Associations.  If someone is considering purchasing a home in an Association we manage, they can expect an Association that operates within the budget set by the Board of Directors and ratified by the Members.  They can also expect the restrictive covenants to be enforced in a fair and compassionate way.  We always send a friendly letter for each first time violation to make the owner aware of the covenant violation and provide a timeframe to correct the violation.  This friendly letter results in 95 percent of the violations being corrected.  In the cases where the violation is not corrected, we do have a set policy that is equally enforced to bring the property into compliance.  The majority of violation letters we send are a result of a neighbor reporting the violation to us for enforcement.  By having a set system, it allows neighbors to be neighbors without having to get into demanding compliance with restrictive covenants.  We facilitate that process for the Board and neighbors.

Whenever I was in town or moved out and tried to call them, they never pick up the phone!!! I moved out of town in July then received a bill in September, with a service that I never used. I tried to call several times, never get answered. I also emailed, no answer as well. They are doing a fair job at maintenance.\nAnother thing that happened when I moved out was all the UHauls were gone during that week, so I asked the main office if I could have a grace period for one day. The premise for me to ask this was my roommate is still leasing the apartment, and she has not found the new roommate yet. I assumed, if she agrees, then I should be good. I went to talk to the main office, the front desk told me to talk to the office at the Midtown apartment. I went there, the lady rejected my proposal and said they will have vendors checking my room right on the day I moved out and through my stuff out even if I have my roommate's permission to place them in the living room. So, I ran crazy for that week looking for moving trucks and finally moved out on time (actually two days in advance). I returned the keys and everything to the main office and told my story. Another lady, seems like the manager or some management-level person told me a totally different answer. She said if my roommate is keeping renting the apartment and agree to let me put my stuff in there, I could have the grace period!!! This is nuts! I was so upset for that day but decided to not give a bad review on Google review. This time, I really cannot. It is not about money, it is their attitude.\n\nUpdated\n\nAround an hour than I left the one star review, they responded and someone finally answered the call. The answer I got for the charge is because of the wreath we had on the door\ud83d\ude44\ufe0fso I told them that is not trash, that is what we used to place outside as decoration. Since my roommate is still living in there, it should not count as something I left not as trash. The new manager of the office said she had no other answer for my question other than I have to pay the \u201creasonable\u201d charge. Oh, the most incredible thing for this management company is they will change the detail of the lease without notifying. Since I am moving out of the town and my roommate will stay, she renewed the lease. When we started to lease the apartment, we get told that we are only leasing our own room (we were paired up by the management company), which means we do not have to lease the whole apartment if we cannot find a roommate. After two years of leasing, our contract have never changed. However, they changed it this year without any notification, and my roommate did not look through carefully so she rent the whole apartment. This is the reason why I thought I should be ok to leave my stuff in the apartment with my roommate\u2019s permission. Based on my roommate\u2019s feedback, their maintainance worked as well as the office does.

It was always hot and water leaked continually out of that unit. He kept a gallon pickle jar under it to catch the water and emptied it daily.

And management NEVER did anything about it.\n\nRoaches were crawling everywhere, in the fridge, from the ceiling where some wall was tearing away. Gnawing through food wrappers. It was disgusting. Colonies were behind the fire extinguisher. He left a month early because he was staying sick.\n\nThe owner showed the unit to a potential buyer and my son told him about the bugs and it embarrassed him in front of the potential buyer.\n\nNow they are billing him for a BRAND NEW AC and NEW BATHROOM SINK. and want him to pay for the damage maintenance did changing out a ceiling fan.  $3000.00!!!!\n\nStay VERY FAR AWAY from Spaces Management and River Point Apts!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83230c148df:0xaac2293f184926e6"}

I was displaced from my apartment for a little over a week while they completely ripped apart my entire bathroom to fix the leak and redo the bathroom.  I let them get started right away and found myself somewhere else to stay.  Well after they finished fixing the leak and redoing the bathroom they just left without cleaning up my apartment.  There was dust EVERYWHERE covering everything in my apartment with a layer of it.  I cleaned all of the furniture myself but the dust was embedded in the carpet and it took almost 2 MONTHS of me calling to finally get them to send carpet cleaners out to clean the carpets.  I'm a little concerned about the health effects of breathing that in for so long.

My family and I moved from a large neighborhood with an expensive mortgage to Peppertree Apartments over five years ago.  Our intent was to \"downsize\" in order to afford to put our two kids through college, debt free.  What a great idea!\nOur expenses at Peppertree Apartments are less than half of what we were paying, and we don't have to mow the grass, clean the pool, or keep up with any of the outside chores we used to have when we were homeowners!  Apartment life DOES have its advantages!\nThe complex has changed ownership 3 times since we first lived here, and currently it is run by a staff that really cares about their clients.  Our packages are received in the rental office and stored until we can pick them up.  Maintenance issues are usually handled within 24 hours.  Major repairs are taken care of --- or else the unit or appliance is replaced.\nPets are welcome, but management requires them to be on a leash when outside.  Neighbors get to know each other.  The staff throws occasional parties to encourage social interaction with new and old neighbors alike!\nAll in all, I recommend Peppertree Apartments for the 1) friendly staff, 2) prompt attention to maintenance and safety; and 3) the AWESOME convenience to everything in the Peppertree/Sturbridge area.  EastChase is just minutes away.  You can walk to the Walmart Neighborhood Market or several restaurants nearby.  Most of the stores are \"pet friendly,\" so you have no excuse not to walk your pooch!\nKids are always having fun playing, neighbors watch out for their safety, the tennis court is newly renovated, and the living is easy.

Unfortunately, things changed.  Maintenance orders do not get repaired-when I was finally able to reach someone in the office to ask about my 3+ week old maintenance order the response was \"oh, we don't check those messages.\"  I received two warnings for throwing cigarette butts on the ground; when I said \"I don't smoke I think those butts are my downstairs neighbors (who did smoke) the response was \"don't you live upstairs?\"  When I said yes I was told \"then they are your butts.\"  When I turned in my notice, I was sent a letter listing the things I needed to do prior to move out and to get my security deposit returned.  Three weeks after sending me the letter confirming they had received my notice the office manager told the new company I was trying to lease from that I had not given a notice; Peppertree was not aware I planned on moving.  The day I signed my lease with Peppertree I paid a $300.00 pet fee, provided a picture of my pet, and provided my pets vet records.  When my new landlord called for a reference he was told Peppertree did not know I had a pet.  It has now been four months since I moved from Peppertree; I have called eight times to ask about my security deposit.  Eight times I have been told \"the manager is at lunch I will have her call you back.\"  I finally sent an email to the management company.  After sending the email, the Peppertree manager did call me; she told me they did owe me my security deposit and a check would be cut on July 17 or 24th.  Well, it is now August 3rd and no check.  I called today and the manager told me \"the cycle of checks for July 24th were not cut.  I'll call you by the end of the day to let you know when you can expect your check.\"  Unfortunately a place that started out so great turned into a nightmare.

The number one concern we have had is outside of our building the ground stays flooded, even when it has not rained which may be part of the water damage we have had. When we moved into the apartment there was water damage all around the windows in the living room, my husband contacted the office and they sent someone out to \"take care\" of the issue, when we came back to the apartment they had just painted over the water damage. We had water damage under the kitchen sink which we reported to the front office, they sent someone out a few weeks later to replace the wood. We later found out that the reason the wood under the since had water damage was due to the dishwasher was flooding the kitchen, when we called about that issue it took weeks to have someone come look at it and then a few more weeks for the dishwasher to be replaced. For several months our outside lights did not work, we have had roaches since we moved in, after reporting that several times the pest control people came out and I was told that what they spray when they come out would do nothing for the roaches we had and they were not even aware we had roaches or they could have used other solutions to get rid of them. The guest bathroom toilet has broken several times and they finally after 6 weeks they came out and just super glued the piece back together. We have had nothing but problems with this apartment since we moved in and we will not be renewing our lease, nor will we recommend these apartments to anyone who asks.

The environment is specifically designed to suit medical students (since only ACOM students and their families/pets can live there). And if you need the absolute closest distance to school, this is second to none. Also, the utilities are all included as part of the rent.\n\nPros:\n- Distance\n- Brand new\n- Included utilities\n\nNow onto the bad part, and why this review was only given 2 stars.\nFirstly, the included utilities is a joke. You will almost always get an overcharge notice on your door before your rent is due. Even in two-bedroom apartments with two people living in it, you will still \"exceed\" the limit 10 months out of the year. So it's either pay up or get roasted in the hotter months (and it gets extremely hot and humid here).\n\nSecondly, even though Corvias claims that it is competitive with the rest of Dothan in terms of pricing, this cannot be farther from the truth. The rent goes up significantly every year, while the limit for utilities, as mentioned above, stays the same. So you just get charged more. There are plenty of other better options in Dothan if you are looking for a good apartment. For example, Magnolia Preserve offers units for about the same price, but better amenities. Places like Fieldcrest offers much cheaper units while still being fairly close. By choosing NOT to live at Summerfield, you are looking at either better units/amenities or saving ~$200 each month.\n\nAlso, you only get a two day grace period for your rent. Yes you should pay your rent on time. But most places offer 4 days of a grace period. And if you are late by even a few hours, you will be charged a late fee immediately, no questions asked.\n\nAll in all, incoming ACOM students beware. Do your research and ask around. This isn't the worst option. But it is far from the best. If you don't mind driving, then stay away from this place. The gas money you spend will be worth it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88929494775a3a33:0x694edb4e598c856"}

I was fined $150 for a parking violation because of the lack of parking spaces. I contacted one of the managers to discuss my issues and he failed to respond for almost a month. After notifying the front office about this twice, he finally responded and thankfully reduced the fine. However, he responded in a snide manner as if he didn\u2019t really care about hearing my concerns. Additionally, we pay for two gyms that are open 24/7. One of them is closed due to covid and the other one is only open during their office hours. I highly dislike the customer service of this apartment and do not recommend living here.

I\u2019d rather burn $700 dollars a month than to live in 1010 the crimson on 17th Avenue in Tuscaloosa Alabama. I will start this rant with when I toured this place months before I actually moved in. They showed me a room that was way bigger, fancier, and overall more appealing than the room I wound up in. I would say the room I\u2019m in now is at least 25 sq feet smaller than the one I was shown. On move in day I was greeted by an elevator that didn\u2019t work (and I live on the 4th floor so carrying all my things up 4 flights of stairs was great!) gates that didn\u2019t work, codes that didn\u2019t work, a crew of movers that didn\u2019t carry a single thing up for me and also a dirty room! As I got in and settled I couldn\u2019t believe the amount of problems I discovered. A bathroom with no towel hanger, a clogged bathtub, a dirty room, a hole in the laundry room door, a non working garbage disposal and a door that wouldn\u2019t close unless you locked the deadbolt. Not to mention that only about 3 wall sockets in the entire place worked. I\u2019ve been living here for over a month and no, the gates have not been fixed, the elevator goes out on a weekly basis, and if you want to figure something out good luck with finding someone who even has a slight clue of what they are talking about. Sure some people may love this place but for a combined $1400 a month to live here, I would say that it is no where near worth it.

As a resident for almost two years, I can truthfully say I've loved my experience here. The maintenance staff responds quickly, there are always activities and giveaways going on at the clubhouse, and being able to walk to the stadium on gamedays (and offer a parking pass to a friend!) are perks you won't find just anywhere. The only downsides I've encountered so far, just this semester, were an accumulation of trash/trash bags around the building I live at and many stray cats roaming the parking lot. Maintenance cleans up the trash quickly, but it gets left around frequently on the weekends. This could be a simple fix if residents would just take their trash to the dumpster, though! Nonetheless, I recommend this complex to everyone, for the location, amenities, and price are hard to beat in T-Town!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1548350411998, "text": "Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Kendall.

They offer a prize amount of money to students who give good reviews about the apartment and then never follow through with paying. The apartment did no sort of cleaning before my move in. There are numerous alive as well as dead roaches swarming the hallways. There are bugs coming up through my sink. The elevator works 2 weeks out of the year. The entrance and exit gates have closed on several cars as well as my own, and granted I pay for my own bills working part time and being a full time student... THEY WILL NOT PAY for the damages that their negligence has caused. My roommate was allowing an abusive and dangerous figure in  our apartment.  the complex and \"on site police officer\" did nothing to move me to a different unit or ban the abusive person off the complex for me and my 2 other roommates' security. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FEAR MY SAFETY. On top of that, this apartment is \"gated\" but allows anyone through the gates... with that being said we are within feet of a very bad area. So do not be surprised if your car gets broken into, apartment, or you hear gunshots. And if you plan on graduating, they will still make you move out before your graduation date instead of staying 2 extra days to walk the stage. I live out of state and as you can see, i pay my own bills and as a full time student I struggle to pay rent on top of school so for the manager, Dejuan, to say \"get an airbnb, hotel, or make some friends to stay at there house\" shows how inconsiderate and personal this apartment complex is with there residents and the people that pay him to live there. Dejuan's excuse was that 4 girls are moving in august 1st for sorority recruitment when the recruitment does not even start until the 10th of august. Also the earliest this apartment allows move in's is august 6th, so Dejuan has contradicted his own words. Don't even take the time to seek help from the people higher than the manager because they will cease to return emails and help anyone out. This is the WORST experience i have ever had.

The property manager has such blatant disregard for all my phone calls and emails and has willfully chosen to ignore my multiple attempts to get in touch with him in person, via phone or through email.\n\nI\u2019ve had issues with them right from the very beginning. The day I was supposed to move in, they gave me keys to an extremely dirty apartment unit. The bathtub and the toilet was in a disgusting state. I had to hire professional cleaners to bring the apartment back to a livable condition.\nThe rest of the building isn\u2019t in a much better shape either. The elevator STINKS. I\u2019d have to hold my breath every time I use it.\nMoreover, every time it rains, the first floor corridor floods and people have to wade through water to get to their units.\n\nOn the day of my move in, they charged an amount of $103.01 to my account claiming it was \u201cutilities\u201d. Why on earth would I have to pay such a huge utility fee before I even start living there? I brought this up with then property manager. I demanded a utility bill with my actual usage before I make any payments. She agreed but the bill never came. After a few days, they started accruing late fee of $10 per day on my account. I reached out to the management again and asked them for a bill a second time and demanded that the late fees be removed since the delay was on their part in not providing me with a bill. They agreed but once again, the previous property manager did not honor her word. After a couple of weeks, she quit and was replaced by the current manager who just doesn\u2019t seem to have the time to return phone calls or emails. The late fees kept accumulating and by the end of my stay, they gave me a move out statement with all the mystery \u201cutility\u201d charges and the accumulated late fee which amounted to a huge balance.\nAnd yet - no bill.\nI have tried to contact the management multiple times over phone. They refuse to connect me to the current manager claiming he\u2019s unavailable. I had even personally gone back to try and talk to someone from the management but no one is ever available. Nobody bothers to return my emails or phone calls. They just couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nOn top of all this, they charged me $25 for a \u201cmissing\u201d parking decal which was never given to me in the first place.\n\nThey also stooped so low as to charge me another $25 because of a single bottle of bleach left under the sink that I\u2019d forgotten to throw away. But then again, what else can you expect from a management who tries to swindle tenants of their money in any possible way? They\u2019re corrupt beyond repair.\n\nBy all means, stay away!

Jenn has been with the company for over ten years and was more than happy to claim she was the reason there was a problem but not willing to provide documentation on when she changed policies that had previously been honored. Jenn and her team need extensive training on setting unrealistic expectations and on fair housing practices. We were sent an approval letter but once corporate was contacted a decline letter magically appeared. How ironic for a complaint to be met with such leadership behavior.\n\nUpon further investigation reviews show that Jenn failed to provide background and credit checks before approving people which is more than likely how crime was a problem here before it was rebranded and more recently before gates were installed. Also how it makes perfect sense approval letters are sent and then decline letters when someone asks too many questions when shady practices are transpiring.

Their gym is fully stocked with everything you need and if you\u2019re an early bird like me you get the place practically to yourself.

We have also had really nice times at Redpoint\u2019s monthly events. They are always trying to keep their residents up to date on things that are happening and making sure we enjoy our time here. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a place to stay don\u2019t pass up the opportunity to tour here. I had my doubts on this place from the way others talked about it, but when I toured I instantly fell in love with the environment and layout.

It's close enough to campus and everything else to make commuting easy, plus theres the shuttle. Work orders get filled quick and without issue. Management has changed like three times since I moved in (Fall 2016), but not much really changed for me. Haven't really had to deal with management, so I can't speak to that. Only ever had to resolve an issue with utilities payment, but that went smoothly. Units themselves are pretty nice, more than enough space for the average person, personal bathroom, kitchen area is also pretty good. I do recommend getting either your own mattress or a mattress pad, mine at least was like a wood plank to sleep on. There have been some issues with other residents causing trouble, but between security and local police that's been taken care of pretty quick while I've been there. Only thing holding the Woodlands back from 5/5 is that it's just a pretty good apartment complex.

They fired the previous managers and brought in competent experienced adults who not only seem to care about my problems, but have been given the resources and capability to fix them.\n\nI personally prefer Kelly and Michelle over the younger manager, but the younger manager is more geared towards their typical demographic, younger students. For students who have been around the block a bit and parents I would strongly recommend speaking to Kelly or Michelle (not saying that the other manager is anywhere near as bad as previous managers, she seems nice, I simply prefer the more experienced of the lot).\n\nThere has also been a push for better privacy (managers do inspections not college student employees) and security. There are still instances of security issues but action seems to be being taken towards fixing that.\n\nThe grounds are still great but it is worth noting that the A/C units here are awful. When they work they are fine but they go out a lot. This is no fault of current ownership, because the original owners made a foolish call of buying cheap A/Cs in Alabama, but hopefully soon they realize that buying better ones will save them a lot of money on repairs in the long run.\n\nOverall, I would, for the first time in a few years, recommend living in Redpoint. If this is a trend then the incredible grounds here could be complimented with a relatively stress free living experience.\n\nThe last star is if they bring back cable in the biggest football college in the world, and I personally have had a lot of issues with the switch to the discount internet provider.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1513646438701, "text": "Steven, we are sorry your experience at Woodlands of Tuscaloosa has not been a positive one.

Nothing about our experience has been pleasant. They did not properly clean the apartment upon moving in. There were many maintenance issue from the very beginning that one of the parents contacted a health inspector to come in. Throughout the school year maintenance repairs have gone unaddressed. My child put in serveral work orders\u200b to have her center air repaired\u200b with no urgency from the management to address the matter. When she moved in there was a leak and at the end of the year there is a leak from a unknown source. I am certain there is mold by now.  Warning!!!!!  Consider long and hard before considering moving your child in this apartment complex......... Since the University of Alabama virtually requires your student in their sophomore year to move off campus there should be a better regulation system in place based upon School standards for the apartment complex in the community surrounding the campus. They completely take advantage of out-of-town students who parents aren't accessible to them and cannot see the poor conditions\u200b in which they live.

They also refuse to provide you with the wattage read-outs since they know the power company only checks every other month and estimates the month they skip.

I chose them without doing any research because I needed a room fast; got locked in base rent and all.  My roommate is currently subleasing to someone who talked to the front office about continuing the lease after the sublease ends and just said the rent was \"pricey\" and they knocked it down from $595/mo to $520/mo just like that.

After that it got worst, since the Woodlands isn't gated there would be a lot of 'local people' coming on to the property one night my roommates car got kicked in and shattered due to some people throwing a party. When one of my roommates decided to move out the staff placed a girl in our apartment that had two large dogs. She never cleaned up after them and destroyed our whole apartment. The staff even allowed her to bring in a large refrigerator because she 'didn't have room' in ours. Jennifer the leasing manager at the time told us to deal with our roommate and if she was such a problem then move out after she threatened our lives, NUMEROUS times. After forcing the office to move me to another unit since I couldn't find a sublease to get out of the hell hole my new apartment WAS NOT CLEAN, the bed was broke, there were stains all over the walls, the window was broken, nothing had been taken care of. When I told the office they needed to take care of this they never showed up, EVER. Later in the year there was a domestic dispute that involved TPD around my unit the gentleman destroyed cars in the parking lot and none of the Woodlands staff came out there, one of the property managers even lived in the building across from our building where it happened. I lived in a flat after moving out of my townhouse, during the spring the maintenance somehow never connected the hose to the apartment above ours washer after doing an inspection. That caused their apartment to flood which overflowed in ours through the ceiling my closet and bedroom were completely flooded ruining my belongings, our kitchen and dining area were flooded as well. They tore holes in our ceiling ripped up my carpet and said they would come back to fix it and never did. On top of our apartment being soaked they told my roommates and I that we needed to deal with and they weren't letting us stay anywhere else even though they caused this problem. Once I moved out they charged me over $300 in move out fees for things that I told them to fix, for a light bulb that was out, and a bunch of other ridiculous things. I knew they would expect money but not that much for little things, I thought that was the whole reason for a security deposit. If I could give this place a -100 I most definitely would. This place is AWFUL! I know the incentives sound good that's how they got me to renew my lease by offering $500 but this place isn't worth it, I had to deal with text alerts about muggings and gunmen on the property, there was a shooting in unit 2, and overall it lives up to it's name 'The Hoodlands' this place is the absolute worst and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

My roommate situation was awful and no matter how much I had gone to management my option was to pay $200 to move and then I was told I wasn't guaranteed the same rent rate because they didn't know what my apartment option would be. My roommate had a mini fridge full of maggots which was causing serious health/pest concerns and all I got from management was \"we will see what we can do.\" I don't understand how a health violation is not a lease violation! I had been threatened by my roommate, intimidated, scared to leave my room, and I couldn't do anything about it because I was not financially able to do so. I believe there needs to be options for people in a position, that is documented, to get out of a dangerous situation but the Woodlands doesn't care about you as a tenate. My roommate also flooded her room by a clogged toilet which ended up leaking into the living room and all maintenance did was bring her a fan to dry her room. I ultimately got to clean up the flooded living room. This place is awful. Management has NO idea how to handle things and won't try to help you. Whatever you do, stay clear of this place.

This review will be worth the read.\n\nTo start off, the phone number that you'll find on any site is not the right number; good luck trying to find it, can't really remember how I managed to get in touch with the 24/7 operator in order to be let back into my home. Also, I can count at least 7 times where I told them that the number was incorrect. So, just to start, this is what you're in for living here.\n\nIf you are unlucky enough to figure out what the number is, it's not like your maintenance request/security concern/need will be met or even humored. The security here is laughable, showing up high to just break up a small party or something and not even showing up when people are setting fireworks off and hitting the side of my apartment building. Speaking of the lack of security, there have been multiple firearm discharges and shootings here where little to nothing has been done. Or, even better, has been swept under the rug in order to maybe stop the running joke of calling this place \"the hoodlands\".\n\nAt first glance it looks like a decent place with nice rooms; which is true for the most part. I moved in without a mattress and my roommate moved in with God knows what on the carpeting in his room. So, if you're lucky, you won't have to deal with that. But then again, track record shows you will and it'll take quite a while to fix whatever issue you have.\n\nThe management is not great at all. I'm not sure if it's the work order making it to maintenance or maintenance following through with the request, but it'd be months before they come out to fix whatever it is. I had a hole in my door for about 4 months and ON TOP OF THAT they tried charging me for it when we (management and I) had emailed back and forth making it clear that I wouldn't be.\n\nSo don't be fooled by the nice pictures at any apartment complex, but please don't be fooled by The Woodlands. You'll have more headache here than imagineable and if you're a student coming here, you've got enough on your plate trying to keep up grades, sleeping, and a social life. There's no point in getting involved in an apartment agency that's only going to make your time here a pain; between the kinds of people that may be living around you, the lack of security, and the lack of caring by the management. I'm sure the owner will comment back on here trying to save as much face as physically possible, probably saying they've changed management and whatnot, but it hasn't gotten better me they've been in control since the top of the year. Don't live here, please. These people running this place, higher up than the students that work on site, need to get the idea that the way things are run around here won't cut it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1500428083763, "text": "Josh, we regret to hear that your experience thus far at the Woodlands of Tuscaloosa has not been what you expected.

My experience with management, the staff, amenities and my apartment itself were all pleasant with only a few bumps along the way that were properly handled as they came up. I hate to get on here and see such negative reviews, but I know many people will only speak out when something goes wrong--so that's why I'm here shedding some light on what an actual experience is like for the typical tenant at The Woodlands. I moved into my apartment the first year with a friend from back home and we experienced a speedy move-in process as far as paperwork and negotiating went. We walked in to find a very clean apartment that was in great condition. There was no sign of previous tenants--even the carpet in our bedrooms and drip pans on the stove had been replaced (which we later learned is standard upon every move-out). We were impressed. Our first few months there went well and without bumps, but then a couple of guys living in the town-home above us left the lid on their washer up and it flooded their apartment and ours. We had water falling from light fixtures, cracks in drywall sheetrock, running down the windows.. it was a nightmare. We contacted management at The Woodlands and they had ServPro there drying up the damage within 12 hours and they left fans and dehumidifiers in the apartment for 3-4 days in order to let it dry completely behind the sheetrock and all. My roommate and I stayed with friends in a nearby unit while this drying took place, as the fans and equipment was pretty loud. After the equipment was gone, we worried that we might have to pay extra in utility bills because of so much power being pulled to operate it all but they gave us both $50 Visa gift cards to offset the extra costs on utilities.\n\nThe bottom line is: The Woodlands is a nice and reasonably-priced place to live in Tuscaloosa. My roommate and I always tried to be reasonable and professional in dealing with management and staff when things would come up and they, in turn, gave us the same fair treatment we gave them. Jennifer, in particular, was always a pleasure to deal with and we usually tried to go through her. We always made it a point to keep record of all our communication and dealings with them so that even if they tried to be unfair, we knew it was possible to go to corporate with issues--although we never had to, thankfully.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a9ca905a3e9b:0x565513db6b344f76"}

This apartment complex cons you in everyway possible. The staff is unproffesional. The amenities that are offered are just more lies fed to the tenants. For example, The Woodlands offer a package that is \"all-inclusive\",however, most tenants would recieve notices of overages. Those that did not recieve any notices were usually under a certain meter range (this is not discussed at the time of the tours offered or the lease signing) and any extra money that is paid for the all-inclusive is kept by the apartment (mho). The complex offers free printing as an amenity, yet the printer was ALWAYS broken. Upon moving out The Woodlands, tenants recieve insane charges. My roommates and I were charged for a damaged couch. I find that odd since we were not the most social bunch, and we did not congregate in the living room. I was also the last person to move out of the unit. I know for a fact that the couch was not damaged. At this time I had already renewed my lease with the complex before any problems had occured. My second year with the complex, my roommate had a dog. The dog damaged blinds in the living room, because the dog was in her contract I was assured that I would not be charged for damages SEVERAL times (I asked several times). My roommate also talked with the complex to make sure that I was not charged, but being ran by the imbeciles that they are, of course I was charged. There is absolutely nothing good about this apartment complex besides that it is appealing to the eyes. I suggest looking for other options. If you do live there, make sure that when moving out you take pictures of absolutely everything. If you are charged for damages, they will only be removed from your bill if you can provide them with photos.\n\nOther fun facts about the woodlands:\n\n1. When I moved into my second unit, the place was disgusting. I was told I could not move into my unit at a certain time because they were cleaning and painting.\n2-10. Because I had lived there the previous year I was able to move into my unit earlier than my roommate who had not. Since her lease was ending with The Retreat, she had requested that she be able to move in early. She was currently in summer school. The Woodlands denied her request because they were \"cleaning and painting\". I allowed her to move her mattress and things into the filthy living room of our new unit, before we left for the east coast. When we came back she was able to recieve the key to her room. The room was filthy just like the rest of the unit. Men's underwear were found in her dresser drawer, as well as a set on the mattress in the living room. We do not know who they belonged to nor where they came from. She bagged the underwear and took them to the complex's office. She was met with laughs from the college students, and the manager shushing her since they were in the process of trying to con other customers to sign a lease.\n\nLiving here was a nightmare.\n\n***The statements in my review about The Woodlands of Tuscaloosa are my opinion and not fact. My personal treatment at the complex is fact. Just a little disclaimer***", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a9ca905a3e9b:0x565513db6b344f76"}

But since I had a decent living experience at Campus Quarters I decided to leave one. I chose Campus Quarter because they were affordable and offer competitive rates compared to the other student housing properties. Also, compared to the other properties CQ looks nice inside and out. The property manager Mike is very helpful at fulfilling residents requests.  Any problem I had I went to Mike (property manager) and he insured me that he will take care of it. And he did. CQ is a very quiet property no complaints of noise or my neighbors. Parking also was convenient for me which was definitely a plus. In all CQ offers good customer service, good rates, and a good living experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}

So I asked for a minute to handle it after paying hospital bills and fines and such and I received rude treatment and no time to handle it. Then my hours dropped at work due to covid-19 and I was unable to do it within the time frame. So I just decided to move out and deal with the move out costs. I was treated horribly after doing so and today I received a call from Mr.Rosengarten who cussed on the phone with me and acted like my problems don\u2019t matter. I told him that they were supposed to take off late fees but they never did (I wasn\u2019t sure if that would help take down the balance a little bit) and he was incredibly mean to me about the fact that that wasn\u2019t enough and that I was confused about that. THIS IS A COLLEGE LIVING PLACE. I\u2019m in my 20s. I don\u2019t deserve to be treated that way by anyone.

Overall the last year and a half was horrible with the management team. Upon move out make sure that you asked them about the specific things you're responsible for. They charge a $65 cleaning feels for each member but that does not include the common areas so you might as well double that price. They're going to get their money one way or the other.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}

There were only two tenants living in the apartment this summer, and both of us were gone a minimum of 8 hours a day, often more. The lights were kept off, the dishwasher not used, and the A/C set accordingly. Every month we were charged at least $20 extra for power. I went to the front desk and asked to see my bill and requested an inspection to see why our bill was so high. The representative was friendly and submitted my request on July 8th. My request was not completed until July 30th, two days after the power bill had been posted. In the report they filed, there was not a single note for me to read about if they found a reason the bill was high or anything of the subject. Keep in mind the other tenants who are not residing here are also having to pay for these power overages. It has been extremely frustrating dealing with these issues. We are all college students with other bills the pay, and it feels like every day I look I have another charge on my account. On top of rent you have to pay $4 a month for pest control, another $4 a month for utility billing, and if you don't have renters insurance it's $12 a month.

They pick and choose which parts of the lease they want to follow, most of the front desk staff is either extremely rude or doesn't know what they're doing. By the time I turned in my keys we were on the 3rd general manager if that tells you anything about the staff here. Maintenance requests were constantly deleted or cancelled by staff. Was told I could store my stuff in an apartment before move-in day and was also informed that I would not be living there, so imagine my surprise when they stuck my preferred roommate in there. Holes in the walls, infants, and drugs everywhere. When I came back for move-in day I was told that maintenance would help me move my stuff, instead, the manager at the time helped me move trash bags filled with not only my stuff, but with actual trash as well. Absolutely ridiculous. Charged a $65 move-out cleaning fee that they wrote in in the special provisions tab which I was told covered the price of someone coming in to scrub the toilets and bathtub. Really? $65 for something I had already done? Also got stuck with a $50 carpet cleaning fee. When I inquired about this additional $50 fee I was not told what was actually wrong with the carpet and then hung up on by the first person, and then told by the assistant manager that typically if someone lives there for a year the carpets just have to be cleaned. So be prepared for that if you choose to live in this fresh hell. This place is just NOT worth the price! I'd much rather live in my car.\n\nRoommate matching is a TOTAL fraud. Got stuck with the messiest, craziest people. I'm trying to go to school and get out, not listen to a bunch of psychos partying in my place until 3am and bringing drugs in and out 24/7. Was told that my roommates nor I could be in the apartment when we had our one TERRIBLE roommate move out. She had keys for 4 days when only permitted by law to have them for 2, did not have to pay the transfer fee that the rest of us were told we would have to pay if we chose to move, also stole from my roommates and destroyed personal property as well as attempted to destroy appliances. Wasn't in school, burned the couch with her curling iron, which the rest of us got charged for upon move-out, abused her two dogs that she didn't pay for, and was constantly smoking weed with all of her friends. Tried to blame me for her drugs and friends, and only after we called the police did she decide to go to the office and say that she was too scared to live with us, and to top it all off call us all racist while she made racial remarks to us the entire time she lived with us. Got a call from Kenyatta telling us that they had \"proof\" that we were racist. Talked to corporate manager about this disgusting accusation and was told that nobody thought that we were racist and seemed confused as to why I was there.

The apartments are nice to a certain degree and the area is convenient that's for the two stars that was given. However, once that lease is signed then everything changes.\n\nThis was my daughter first experience with college and leaving home and it was unethical. They are overpriced with their made up electric overages and will not repair anything unless the parent actually calls. Ms. Kenyatta seemed to be very helpful from the very beginning but upon moving out apparently she became frustrated and was very mean to my daughter so I begin dealing with her.\n\nThey will overcharge for things that you never even heard of and its ridiculous that they rip off young adults that are becoming the future.  They tell you one thing then do the next. I think they would be better if they were to increase their customer service skills and explain to tenants their procedure upon moving out. They will create charges like never before and will repeatedly tell you that its going on your credit. I think they actually enjoy that part.\n\nAlso there were shooting incidents in the parking lot and the only response they could give was \"everything is fine\" we will have security to patrol the area. It seems to me they should have been more proactive. The shooting was the last straw for me.\n\nIf you move here make sure you take pictures upon moving in and moving out.  Try not be so needy.

Had my rent paid ahead of time. Upon moving in, there was mold all on the baseboards of my bathroom. Upon moving out, I turned the air off; as I was NOT going to be paying overages when I'm not even living there. (My overages were around 20-40 bucks a month) They were high and very inconsistent. I would have an overage of 30 bucks or so in the month of December. (I was home 90% of that month and the air would be off and windows cracked) Then in the middle of July, air on, windows closed, my overage was around 7 dollars. Makes no sense.\nSo I move out, turned the air off, left my apartment clean. I get a text from my ex-roommate saying that there was mold all over the place. Myself being the last one there, I was charged with a $7,000 dollar statement for cleaning that tiny, tiny apartment. That's enough money to clean an entire 2 story house with mold worse than that.\nNot to mention that maintenance barges in whenever they please (email or not), dogs are off-leash everyday.

If you are in college to party and do drugs this is the place for you. You will smell Marijuana continuously throughout the day and night everywhere throughout the apartment. Do not stay here if you are planning on sleeping whatsoever. Constantly getting bogus overages for charges that were not my responsibility was a major issue. One instance Was trash leftover in the balcony that was not mine, was fined heftily for this. Being fined for leaving a trash bag for less than 30 seconds while going back inside and getting my car keys was another 50 bucks.

Management did nothing but send out a small email about it.. and getting your $250 back from your deposit takes up to 4-5 months to come to you.\nNow, I need to get this out there so you guys can see what kind of people they hire. One day, I heard BANGING on my door.  It took me all but about 3 seconds to get there before they were already unlocking my door and coming in. I get to the door, and my dog is doing what he does best and investigating the people coming in his home. He comes up with a toy in his mouth and sniffs their feet, very friendly,wagging his tail. THEN the guy that was with a girl to do the inspection, puts his hand on my dog\u2019s chest and SHOVES him back(20 lbs dog) and tells me to \u201cwatch my dog...\u201d From there, this man straight up went in my room, opened all of my drawers to my chest of drawers, all of my cabinets in my bathroom, snooped in my closet, and did the same exact thing to my roommate\u2019s room as well and left EVERY light on and EVERYthing open. NOT TO MENTION they are supposed to email you a notice about inspections. I did NOT get one for that day or hardly any others.\nThem being able to come in if someone doesn\u2019t answer the door is just a huge invasion of privacy in my opinion. Imagine getting out of the shower or being IN the shower and not being able to hear your door being knocked on and someone comes in your apartment.. a stranger at that.\nTowing has a $250 fine PLUS its like a 30-45 minute drive to the super sketchy, very obviously cheap towing company where the staff is insanely rude.\nOVERAGES. Always, always about 20-30 dollars in overages every single month. No matter if you weren\u2019t there for all of a month (like December for example\u2026 Christmas time)\nSo, I moved out at the beginning of March in a rush to leave that place for multiple reasons. I get a call (in July) from management saying that there is a HUGE mold issue in my apartment due to \u201cexcessive moisture\u201d. I cleaned my apartment from head to toe before I left. Down to vacuuming, sweeping and mopping. And left it just how I found it, except probably better. I received pictures, and the mold is EVERY where\u2026 ceiling, baseboards, couch, chair, walls.. you name it. And they are blaming ME for it. It is all due to the AC closet in my bedroom that has an oddly direct flow from outdoor air. I even mentioned that I had turned my air off to someone at the front desk before I left and was told, and I quote, \u201cOh that\u2019s perfectly fine! No problem!\u201d Now, If I hadn\u2019t had the overage problem the whole time, I would have left it on anyways. But I just do not see the point in paying overages for not living there in the first place.\nPLEASE read these comments, guys. They WILL rob you of your money... DO NOT DO IT. Paying this much (about 1400 for a small two bedroom apartment w/ overages) with this much of a hassle just to be so close to South is NOT worth it. Clock an extra 10-15 minute drive and live somewhere much better and worth your time and money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532302173113, "text": "Hi FreetoFly16 - Thank you for your review and feedback.

It asks us to rate it with a star, and I cannot figure out why there aren't any stars on the negative side of zero.  My daughter moved in there for college 2 years ago this past August and at first all seemed fine, but as time went by my thoughts on that changed.  My daughter was charged overages every single month and there was never an understanding as to why.  Maintenance would pop in whenever they wanted without any kind of a notice and I do mean POP in.  We got something for her door so she couldn't be surprised unannounced again.  She decided to move out towards the beginning of the year.  She was paid up in rent, so as soon as she found her a better place she moved all of her belongings out and cleaned the apartment from top to bottom.  The apartment was 100% clean and ready  for a new tenant.  My daughter turned the air off when she left because that's what one does when no one will be living there.  Fast forward maybe 2-3 months..........She gets a lengthy letter from them demanding $7,000 in damages because of mold!  Her little apartment had mold from ceiling to floor, all on the walls, in the cabinets, in the toilet, all over the furniture, everywhere!   Any and everywhere was covered in mold.  It was unbelievable!  Her ex-roommate sent her pictures and I'm here to tell you it was disgusting,  but it was not my daughter's wrong doing or fault that caused this.  I am not one to bad mouth anyone, but if the shoe fits, you wear it!!  My question is what is wrong with a buildings structure or inner walls to make a room become so overwhelmingly engulfed in mold in such a short period of time?  What has been behind these walls all this time?  Is this why my daughter's nose stayed stopped up?  Is this why she was always sneezing?  Lots of questions are coming to mind.  I could understand if my daughter was being negligent or irresponsible, but that simply is not the case here.  They are now holding us responsible for their problem.  Do NOT let your child live here.  It is NOT what it seems.  The people who consider themselves to be \"in charge\" take advantage of our children because they know that most children straight out of high school are easily mis-lead and easy to screw over.  They figured wrong when speaking about my daughter.  So many kids live here and the bills are paid without question from \"mama and daddy's\" bank account, and most parents don't even think or ask to see a bill probably.  I wonder how much money they make in one month alone in overages??  Imagine how much in a year.  It's ridiculous!  Do yourself and your child a favor and look elsewhere.  Oh!!! and don't be fooled by the good reviews from the tenants.  That's the new ones who were promised a little gift card for writing a good review.\nSusan Sumrall", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}

Comcast told me that they see the problem but were unable to do anything about it unless they had an employee tell them to reboot.

Luckily my parents were coming over to visit that day so I asked my dad to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong on the thermostat, still wouldn't work. So we call CQ (seriously it's July and it's hotter in my apartment than outside) and ask for someone to come fix the AC. That was around 3:00pm Sunday. They said they'd have someone come out to look at it that day. No one showed up until the next morning when i got back from class around 10am. I had to sleep on my couch with 3 fans blowing on me (I've been on more comfortable camping trips). Got charged a huge overage for this too.\n\nOh and my favorite part is when the maintanance guy mentioned above comes in to fix my fan. He stands on a chair in my room and tells me to flip the switch. Nothing happens. Then he spins the fan with his and a few times and tells me to call if i have any more problems. I don't think he made it to his car before it quit spinning.\n\nSeriously this place is a joke. Students reading this, you can do better. Parents, don't let your kids move somewhere they'll have this many problems with.\n\nP.s. They go in your room whenever they please. Granted, they knock first, but I have heard them knock and go into my empty roommates' rooms before. Honestly, this makes me uncomfortable.  And this part might be too much information, but one day coming home from class I see one of the maintenance workers going door to door and it looks like he had just come out of my apartment. Myself or my roommates haven't been there all day, but when I go in, there was an unbearable smell. He had used my bathroom.\n\nI'm sure not many people will take time to read this, but if I could tell you one thing it would be - when you come to visit try to come in and walk around the complex and ask people you see walking around their honest opinions and if they would recommend living here. I'd be willing to bet that there's more negative than positive answers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}

Lots of maintenance problems too: the air filter in the apartment I stayed at probably hadn't been changed since the place was built because it was completely clogged. First floor apartments have bugs too. The kitchen counters are warped and starting to break, the carpets are nasty, and the cracked window in the bedroom still hasn't gotten fixed either.

We waited just to move into a dirty apartment. Nothing was prepared for us. The mailbox key was the wrong key and the mailbox was broken so we couldn\u2019t get our mail, and of course we were waiting on something important to be delivered. We didn\u2019t have a gate opener so we had to use a code that worked half the time. When I finally received a gate opener it didn\u2019t work because they didn\u2019t activate it. The gate is trash and stopped working. Then our laundry room was flooding b\\c of the air conditioning. We had to call them 3 times before they actually fixed it, just for it to happen again months later. We paid rent EVERY month ON TIME but they would put all the rent either on my account or my room mate\u2019s account so we would get eviction notices. This has happened at least 6 out of the 9 months we have lived here. Then they decide they want to take up the carpet and replace it with something else while we\u2019re still living here!! They kept changing the date so the day ends up being on a week where I have worked three 16-hour days plus I have back issues and need an operation so I\u2019m having to try and move all my stuff out of my room and closet so they can do something they could\u2019ve done after we leave this place!! Which just made my pain worst. For a month or two they had no groundskeeper so there was dog feces all over the property!! Everywhere you stepped you were likely to step in it. The tub is made of horrible material and is terribly hard to clean. The faucet in the bathroom has been leaking since I moved in. The walls are thin and you can hear the people upstairs. The dryer is trash and you have to dry your cloths twice just to get them dry. There\u2019s no button for the garbage disposal. This place is trash for the cost!!

My overall experience here was above average and I did enjoy living at Vie at University Downs, but it was a roller coaster. The staff is AWESOME. Nothing else to say there, they are all really good people and willing to help. I moved in fast and it was very easy, especially from a gentleman named Rulondo who helped me numerous times during my residency. Also, I want to emphasize how impressed I was with the security in the complex. There are numerous guards roaming and keeping watch, I felt very safe here.\n\nIn the units, the floor layouts are nice and the rooms are pretty spacious, the living/dining room especially.\n\nI did however, have a few things I\u2019d like to share. The first negative experience I had was after I was all moved in, I realized my apartment\u2019s living room and dining room was unfurnished. I was informed that when the new ownership took over earlier in 2018, they furnished every unit with furniture. The one I lived in however, had a resident who had been in there prior to the change in management and had personal furniture already in his room. They told him that In order to get the living room stuff: couch, chair, television, tv stand, dining room table, chairs (basically everything one would need in a living space), that he must also accept the bedroom furniture. This meant he had to move all of his stuff out of there. Since he already had everything he needed, he declined.\nIronically, the other two bedroom units were furnished but the living room was still left empty. I tried numerous times to get furniture in this apartment but it felt like the staff really didn\u2019t care about doing this and just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I was told numerous times that because we had already \u201copted out\u201d of receiving furniture months ago, there was \u201cnothing they could do.\u201d Also, I know for a fact there was a plethora of extra furniture available. I let it go because I only signed a short term lease but to me this was unacceptable and simply just laziness on the management\u2019s part.\n\nIn October, the whole complex underwent a network change to a company called Single digits. In summation, we were without internet connection for about two weeks and even after everything was \u201cfixed\u201d I still experienced issues. I discussed this with the staff and I can vouch for them that they did everything they could to get it up and running as fast as possible. However, I don\u2019t know if they made the correct decision going with this company.\n\nSomething minor, but I felt necessary to be addressed is there are a lot of bugs. I am aware this was a problem a long time ago and the staff has previously addressed this, but I still had numerous experiences. Ant infestations: One in my bedroom from the trashcan and one in the kitchen pantry. This was fixed easily by a few and traps but still gross and took a while to clean up the dead ants. I am not sure if the property had been treated for bugs but mine definitely wasn\u2019t, not to mention that there were roaches in the kitchen, often.\n\nAfter seeing what other apartment complex\u2019s are like. Yes, I had a few complaints, but I want to make sure the management can see these because feedback is a great way to improve. Vie at University Downs does have a lot to offer and it was a nice place to live. With a few fixes and changes, this place has the potential to be a top notch choice for living in Tuscaloosa, but changes definitely need to be made. They are upgrading the clubhouse and I assume it will be very nice.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583962215841, "text": "Thank you so much for your useful insights.

I moved in late September to a 3 bedroom unit. However my garbage disposal has constantly went out every month, my hot water heater leaks onto the floor in the washing room and the dryer has to be rigged to keep running and this is just the beginning. I was moved into a unit that was already occupied in which it states on our move in lease if you moved in during the month of august you have 72 hours to get the lights in your name. So I think my apartment already has a power account attached to it that I just have to pay on. I gave something one month however in the month of December my power has been turned off due to it not being in someone's name. I was never notified of ANY of this and to make matters worse neither one of the two people I live with will reply to my text messages nor my calls. I'm just ready for my lease end honestly. If you already have roommates maybe it's not that bad but this is a very unacceptable situation. And to make matters worse the best option the leasing office could give me was to pay the start up fees and bill for Alabama power and bring in the bill and they will charge it to my roommates accounts. First off I shouldn't have to handle this myself, second off why would I want to continue staying in a unit where I can't get a answer from either one on A matter as serious as this. I'm the one without power right now while both of them are gone and nobody is helping me fix this", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481646356614, "text": "Hey Tony,\n\nWe are so sorry that you are having problems with your power.

I understand there is a large amount of residents that occupy this complex, but in-turn, office workers and management should be working urgently to process maintenance requests and to solve other issues to keep PAYING CUSTOMERS satisfied with their living space. This has not been our experience while living here. My sister and I have lived with UD for almost 6 months and requests we put in those 6 months ago have still not been taken care of. Don\u2019t bother calling the office because they probably won\u2019t answer. And they have neglected returning promised phone calls on multiple occasions. Office is known to close earlier than the hours listed on their door/website which is inconvenient for those of us who work, or interested people traveling from out of town. It is very unfortunate because we love the property, but until management changes I believe these issues will remain the same.

I went on about thirty different tours of different complexes in Tuscaloosa to view one bedroom apartments as this was my only option due to the issues I had leading me to needing a place. To say the least a majority of the apartment options in this town are sketch especially when its last minute last chance in May. However when I came to the downs, Bronson took me and my mom and sister on a tour and it was a great experience. I wanted to see the type of unit I would actually be living in as opposed to just a model unit and they understood my concerns so they made it happen. One of the other employees, Jade, let me go into her apartment and see what it was like since that would be the layout I would ultimately end up with, without hesitation or second thought. I ended up signing for this current year and have been here since August. I have nothing but great things to say about the office staff especially Andrew who truly makes anyone's day each time you see him. Being so far away from family no matter what year you are in is always hard but the staff always is so welcoming and caring. When you read other reviews they talk about disasters of maintenance and such where their needs aren't attended to but I have not seen where that's an issue. Like normal there are always going to be household things that need fixing no matter where you live, its just a part of life and being a tenant. I have had my fair share of unwanted critters (yikes its ok I am alive still) or leaks/minor breaks but no matter what the office always responded fast and urgent for me. People fail to forget that its usually just one person, Ryan, doing all the repairs so they need to cut him some slack and be understanding that the issue will be addressed quickly but maybe not immediately. As far as safety goes, I feel secure at the apartment and the one incident where I was nervous about someone near my apartment I called the office and legitimately a golf cart, and I am talking like one of those extended ones, full of staff came zooming in and investigated and checked in on me to make sure I was okay, including Taylor Duncan the leasing manager too. I find that the staff really makes the living experience worth while at apartment complexes which is why I gave 5 stars overall. I had a few hiccups here and there with maintenance or billing like I mentioned but those issues were resolved to a level of satisfaction which is the part that matters most. Now that this novel of a review is over have a great day and if you are in a predicament where you need not just a house but a home stop on over here at UD!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1518124468038, "text": "Thank you Tiffani Greene for sharing your fantastic experience with us.

When I first began paperwork with them they were undergoing renovations, which at the time was exciting to see. When I came in a couple weeks later to finish my paperwork they had lost it! Papers that had my entire identity plastered all over them as well as my co-signers (parents) info! This happened TWO more times. When everything was finally taken care of I had signed during an incentive to get a $600 dollar gift card or use it as credit towards my first months rent, so being the poor college student that I am I put it towards my rent, well when it came time to pay first months rent they told me I couldn't use that incentive because I was in a privately owned unit. Why would you assign a resident who signed during an incentive special, a condo that's privately owned therefore cancelling out that incentive?\n\nIt's just one inconvenience after another with these guys. Probably because they can't get a property management company to stick around long enough for things to flow smoothly. University Downs has gone through three ownerships since I've been involved with them. The staff is almost entirely undertrained or under-qualified to be handling the responsibilities they're supposed to take care of with ease. Nearly every question is answered with \"I'll have to check with my manger when they get back\". Which then leads to nothing because the manager is never around.\n\nAlso if you're planning to live on the condo side rather than the apartment side then please know that all those inclusions they promise like wifi/cable or Google Chromecast are NOT included. They didn't share that until after we had signed or lease.\n\nTruly an awful experience. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for housing. Aside from the awful management the condos are higher quality builds than most of the newer places, however be prepared to do all of the move-in cleaning yourself, I've never seen such a gross move-in room.

However, my experience with University Downs in Tuscaloosa has been an absolute nightmare. The experience has been so negative that it warrants more than just a bad review, but also legal action.\nAfter the new management company (Asset Campus Housing) bought the complex from Ellis-Trick, all of the services went downhill. From trash pickup to rent payment every facet of life at UD changed for the worse. Most importantly, the management staff (not necessarily the office staff) has been unhelpful, incompetent, and downright rude.\nFirst, even though my name was on the lease (I am looking at a copy right now), my name was NEVER put into their system, so every time I called they couldn\u2019t speak with me (or pull up my lease apparently). Furthermore, they never put any of the emails on my lease into their system. When my roommate wrote a check for $785 instead of $795 on accident, we were never notified of the \u201clate payment\u201d either by phone or email \u2013 even though they had both. So they after a few months that $10 charge grew into hundreds. They then had the audacity to place an eviction notice on my door. So they can walk to my apartment to threaten eviction but they can\u2019t notify me of a $10 dollar payment??? Needless to say I paid the $10 dollars I owed them, but not a penny more! And I wished it ended there\u2026\nWhen I moved to a different city over the summer (and paid two rents because I didn\u2019t want to sublease!) they actually moved another person into my apartment!!!! I found out about this when I went back to my apartment on checkout day (to turn in my key) and there was someone else living in there with all their stuff! I have had two UD employees acknowledge this, but they don\u2019t see a problem with it at all \u2013 even though I was still paying rent!\nFinally, after months of phone calls, emails, and weeks on end of no response, I still have not received my security deposit back. They have acknowledge \u2013 finally \u2013 that they owe me the security deposit, but now they said they \u201cmailed the check.\u201d That was over three weeks ago. This is on the point of ridiculous. The managers at the office do not care. They are rude and completely unprofessional. I have friends who have been through similar experiences at UD! And you should understand. I took pride in my apartment. It was always clean inside and out, and well taken care of.\nI could go on for another page or two\u2026\nI am going back to Tuscaloosa in a few years, and they could not PAY ME to live there.\nFinally, apparently the complex is being purchased by a new company in 2016. Don\u2019t live there!!! They are keeping the same rude and unprofessional managers \u2013 so nothing will change. In fact, it will probably get worse.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a82f5f021da3:0x9a4a2ef42a843052"}

I have called her four times this week, and at this point she is avoiding my calls and messages.

The appliances all do not work correctly. Staff/maintenance comes in whenever (literally they will knock and, from the back bedroom, not give us enough time to put pants on and go open the door before they are already letting themselves in) to fix or change things without even telling residents. They have just come in our place numerous times this year with numerous excuses. They tell you they would give residents a heads up if they have to come in, but that is not true. One day while we had multiple friends over, they came in and said they had to paint all our walls. Needless to say, that was the final straw and we told them they could not paint that day randomly without telling us, while we had people over. We live on the second story and one morning we were woken up at 8 am bc some workers had climbed up the back balconies and were on our back porch working, of course without telling us. I have never lived somewhere where maintenance just comes in without warning so many times in a year. Our friends have a joke going on about hanging at our apartment because maintenance will probably be joining us. Also, one day when they randomly came, we had an empty cat litter box. No cat, not cat toys/food, not even cat litter, just the empty box, and then they tried to charge us $500 by saying we had a pet and kept coming by randomly to catch a nonexistent cat in our place. Even then, $500 seemed like much for a cat. Another thing, along with not telling any residents about maintenance coming to do anything in residents places, they have also decided to change the internet connection and password without telling residents. We went almost a week, a school week without internet is very difficult, thinking the internet had gone out without being fixed. We finally called and they told us it had been changed. We told them we were not happy they would do that without telling us, therefore making us go without. The next day, after we had gone the week without internet and then resolved the issue, they came by and put a paper in our door telling us they changed the internet, so at least our complaining did something, even if it was a week too late.\nOverall, you will not have the privacy you want in your apartment and do not count on the staff/maintenance to do great jobs. If you can get pass that, the pools and community itself is not bad, just needs better people running it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a82f5f021da3:0x9a4a2ef42a843052"}

I will admit the apartment themselves are not terrible, but the management is. I had to call the police on my roommate 3 times in one semester. My things were stolen, trash was dumped outside my room for days straight, my cabinets were locked shut, drugs were done in the apartment and I cut my foot open on a broken wine bottle that was smashed outside my bedroom door and still management said they had no grounds to evict her. The utilities are a scam, my front door won't lock from the inside, the air conditioner broke multiple times and maintenance has yet to do anything (while it was over 90 degrees outside).\n\nPayment is a joke, they have switched payment and utility companies three times in the year I've lived here, without any notice. When you are unable to pay due to their system AND notify them, you'll still get hit with late fees that aren't taken off your account. I did not set foot in my apartment for 3 weeks and yet still got charged $80 that month for electricity overages. Ridiculous.  Crazy how I still got 6 calls asking if I want to renew, because they're that desperate for money. They also will not respond to your concerns no matter how many times you email or call.

I gave it a 5 star rating... Now I wouldn't even give it 1 star... I have lived here since the early move in last year. I have paid my rent and electricity on time with no complaints. I have even had 4 yes FOUR of my friends sign here for the next year.\n\nNow a year later I have tried dealing with the management on two different cases, and I am extremely upset at the unprofessionalism of this place.\n\nThe first was a problem with a different room. We had to call Tuscaloosa Police Department, and they could not do anything about it. Only management could fix the problem. I soon sought out a meeting with the property manager in which I was told that she couldn't do anything. She could only speak with the other residents about the situation, but could not physically do anything. So either she lied to me or TPD did...\n\nCase #2 I will have a new roommate next year. We are both in the band at Alabama. My roommate is a section leader and that requires her to be on campus on August 5th. She just recently had hip surgery and is unable to physically move items, and The 9 refuses to allow her early move in and instead is forcing her to board on a couch (WITH A BROKEN HIP) or pay for a hotel for 2 weeks. With me already living in the aprtment and only one new person moving in I asked if she could get in a few days early. Instead I was told that they would not allow any early move in's and that I would just have to leave her MY apartment keys to let her have a place to stay for the 2 weeks she will basically be homeless. Also, I would like to point out that The 9 refused to let her sign due to my current roommate not resigning yet. So not only did she not get any early move in, but she also recieved a rate that is $50+ more per month than she would have originally.\n\nThe most recent problem just occurred. I went in due to me not having 24 hour access to the club house. This is apparently a problem with all keys. I would just like to point out that it is now July 2018 one year later and nothing has been fixed. When they \"fixed\" my keys they instead cut everything under my name off. I lost access to locking/unlocking my apartment door, access to the clubhouse, and my cardeal stopped working. I am now on day 3 of dealing with this situation and I have only 2/3 of the problems fixed. The manager is the one who messed up my key, and refuses to help me because it is an \"inconvience\". However, the only thing she is inconviencing is me. I have spent at least 2 if not more hours in the office trying to get things fixed to hear that only the manager can fix it. I was also asked \"Well can't you just leave your door unlocked?\" So instead of making sure a resident who pays $756 a month not including electricity has a working door I was just pushed aside. It took me getting rude to actually get that fixed. Now I can't get my car fixed because the manager refuses to do anything.\n\nFor anyone wanting to live here I want to warn you of how little the management actually cares for you. They only care about their time and not about what you need. Just a warning from someone who did love this place, but now might not resign becuase this is ridiculous.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a813303960bb:0x18a56ec6e5cb5415"}

This complex is previously known as \"Harbor on the 6th\", and if you search for reviews with that name, you will definitely learn the truth about this complex. As many others have said before me, it definitely is not all that it is said to be. Starting with the apartments themselves, they are nothing spectacular. The walls are paper thin-you can hear everything going on around you, the carpet comes up so easily (even when you vacuum), and plenty of carpenter ants make their way through the windows even though the complex claims to provide their residents with pest control every month. There are also no elevators in most of the buildings so prepare yourself to walk a multitude of steps before making it to your apartment. The front gates to enter the complex never work and always seem to be broken! And people are typically going 50+mph while driving through the complex. The parking situation is another disaster in itself. Half the time, many of the handicapped spots are taken by vehicles that have no handicap tag at all. On top of that, there are typically no spots available close to your unit, and you have to park and take the hike from the parking deck (ex: this is awful when carrying groceries). As for management, it is truly a challenge to get in contact with the office. There have been plenty of times that I have attempted to reach out, and in fact, have received absolutely no response whatsoever. Please thoroughly research your apartment options before signing a lease here. It'll save you the trouble, and a lot of money. I understand that it is considered to be affordable student housing, but after all of the random charges that'll be billed to you, you'll definitely be paying more than you expected.

The best part about it is the maintenance guys, they are the sweetest and quickest people alive. I have never had a problem they can't solve for me within 24 hours. Positives about the complex is that the pool is generally clean (watch out though, a lot of random foot traffic come through and don't care enough to clean up after themselves), the staff responds well to problems and concerns, and a courtyard is finally replacing the awful grey concrete slab we had on the second floor before. Also, the place is very safe (security access) and close to campus.\n\nHowever, it is very overpriced for what you get (no gym, packages don't always make it to your door or mailbox, staircases are always filthy and smell of urine and beer), you now have to pay for parking when it used to be free, the floors in the hallways tend to have dog pee on them, and worst of all, you hear literally everything your next door neighbors and upstairs neighbors do and say. I had to listen to the girl above me fighting with her boyfriend, moving furniture at 3 am and even her listening to music. It was insane. My roommates and I left them multiple notes and called in a noise compliant and the girls responded by taping a nasty letter to our door. Not fun, and nothing we got help with. Also, I finally got used to the train after 3 years of living there, but it is really loud and will shake your whole room.\n\nOne thing I would definitely have loved to see is a night guard to just patrol around a little every now and then.\n\nI'd say this apartment would be great for sophomores, but when you reach a higher age you probably want to head somewhere a little quieter and more budget friendly.\n\nAll in all I don't regret living here, but I wish I would have moved out about a year earlier.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558040793761, "text": "Jennifer, thank you for giving us your thorough feedback.

They also promised us $200 gift cards last year for resigning, which NO ONE recieved. They make a lot of big promises that are never fullfilled.

Pest control may come, but never resolves the issue. Sometimes pest control says they\u2019ve came and they actually never come so you\u2019re left waking up with gnats in your bed! Renovated apartments look nice until you move in and find a ton of things need to be done. Gym sucks, pools are about the only great amenity.

I was asked to take down this review by the property manager here at The Magnolia because she didn't want anyone to know what I really thought of this place and its management. Well, I'm putting my review back up and this time it's staying. The Magnolia has some of the worst management I have ever come in contact with. The managers are rude and dismissive of issues that I've had. They have allowed their vendors to enter my room without my knowledge, violating my privacy and then treating the issue like a small minor problem. Maintenance is stoned whenever they come to fix things, never in a timely manner, and the manager denies this fact. In the end, it doesn't matter if you fixed it or not, the process was arduous and awful for me. They were rude almost the ENTIRE time and did not treat me like a customer who is paying their salary. They in NO WAY went above and beyond to assist me. They did the BARE MINIMUM. I have many more complaints that I've already sent to corporate that contain way too much for one google review.

I have renewed multiple times due to the proximity to my workplace and the relatively low rent but working with management has been a nightmare. I have called and visited the front desk FREQUENTLY to try to get a hold of the manager but she is always conveniently \"in a meeting.\" I believe the front desk student assistants do their portion of the job taking down my name, unit & phone # to have her call me back but I have NEVER gotten a call back. It has taken my roommate and I 2.5 YEARS of harassing the front desk student workers only to get a flooring issue \"semi\" resolved by the management. OCCASIONAL email replies as a result of the harassment is the only form of communication we have been receiving. I am also expecting TWO concession payments: one of which clearly states that it would be given out within 30 days (it has been almost two months now) of the lease renewal date and another for referring a friend. This latter one does not even have a contract or a form of agreement, so the only argument I have in favor of my case, is a screenshot of the advertisement from two months ago. When inquired about this issue, the office only came back to me and said that I would hear from corporate soon and took no action whatsoever to accelerate this process. The only positive side of this complex is that the in-house maintenance is usually quick to respond (and the high water pressure is a bonus). There have been more than enough hiccups with our air conditioning which eventually got switched out to a new one (most of the A/C units are probably in need of an upgrade due to age). Gates have been installed as a \"solution\" for all the shootings that have happened recently, but have not been activated as they are still waiting to pass out parking passes/gate access as we approach the THIRD month of the lease term. There have been three changes in management companies in less than three years, which should explain the mess that this apartment is in, but I believe the actual on-site manager, Christina, who has stayed at the site despite the changes, is a main source of all these negative reviews from current residents. If \"short-staffing\" is the issue here, please hire someone else to help her address these matters - this apartment is not maintained well enough to justify the rent and the lack of response that the residents are receiving.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569528416498, "text": "Clara, thank you for sharing this experience with us.

I wouldn't say my experience has been perfect, but you get what you pay for. As The Social is one of the most affordable apartment complexes in Auburn, you shouldn't come here with overly high  expectations. For the price you pay, this is a great complex. They are not as renovated as I had hoped, but the appliances are in good working order, which is all that matters to me. Management has worked with my roommates and I each time we have had an issue. Recently, they credited our accounts after a broken AC unit ran up the power bill. Next week they will be replacing the unit. Maintenance can be slow to respond at times, but this typically coincides with times when many people are putting in requests, such as on move-in day. The staff at The Social are always helpful and have resolved each issue I have presented them with. I would say overall that The Social is a great place to live and I would recommend it to others.\n\nUpdate: Since my original review, all of my kitchen appliances have been replaced. The kitchen was completely redone and I was told I should be getting new furniture in the near future. A new management team has taken over and made vast improvements to the property and to many, if not all, of the units. Currently they are resurfacing the front pool and soon they will be putting a dog park in the back of the complex.

The complex never issued us guest parking passes in the first place.

Most apartment complexes issue their residents one parking pass and a guest pass but not the social!

It's a good location because Walmart is right across the street. When my lease was up I moved out and was suppose to get my security deposit back. They claimed they didn't have my forwarding address (which I wrote down on the move out paper and outside the envelope I turned in) so they sent it to THEIR address and told me to come pick it up. Once I got there they claim the move out check wasn't there and I drove 30 minutes from another location so I basically wasted my gas. Still waiting on my security deposit refund. I have called numerous times and even called the company that owns the social.\n\nUPDATE:!!!\nI moved back in about 2 years later since they had changed management thinking things were going to get better. They fined me for putting trash outside my door right before I took it out. They just want every little dime you have. Company and management sucks. Still didn\u2019t get my $150 gift card they promised for resigning my lease. This year DEFINITELY WILL NOT be resigning for next year. It\u2019s like living in a damn dorm or jail. What\u2019s the point of having an apartment when they still micro manage everything you do", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578422322778, "text": "Hi Ky, I am sorry for your bad experiences at our community.

What I love most about this location is the fact that there are no gate codes. You can get home ASAP.\n\nI never worried about safety. I see security frequently patrolling at night to make sure we\u2019re safe. Also, parking is not an issue. I\u2019ve always found a spot for me and my guests when I have them. However, the Tow company does not play. If you are not in a visitors spot come night time your car will be gone. I\u2019ve experienced this before I was a resident.

I\u2019ve dealt with maintenance men who would get the job done and leave tracks of whatever they fixed, but not here.\n\nThe complex has many events for us.

This year I stayed here by myself, my roommates had it with them but, due to the fact I use the Interstate to travel back and forth to Montgomery its closer so I stayed. BIG MISTAKE. I had to pay them $200.00 to transfer into a two bedroom apartment which they stated I could move in mid July. I did not move in until LATE AUGUST. The apartment I moved in was not cleaned properly especially the carpet. The reason I say that was b/c when I moved in here they carpet cleaners people says they were suppose to clean the carpet in the apartment, which was suppose to be VACANT I assume since they came. Well folks the carpet cleaning people NEVER showed back up. So now in this apartment, there are PEST  in the carpet and its literally attacking me. HOW SPOOKY is that. In the words of Dr. Cunningham there are fleas in the apartment. Yet, I have NO DOG NOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ANIMAL. So that had to come from someone who lived here before me. They don't follow the roommate matching paper that you do. They stick you with anyone here. The people at the front office is VERY RUDE!!!!! I would not dare waste another year over here. Its so unprofessional, and they have no care about if the apartment burns down. If you have another options (which there is) please don't come here....

The staff is extremely rude, no professionalism whatsoever. If you have a concern and try to explain it to them, they never let you speak and try to talk over you. I\u2019ve left their place in tears because I was never reassured that my concern would be taken care of. They talk to you in a condescending attitude and act as if it\u2019s your issue to deal with, and that they have \"no responsibility\" over it and shouldn\u2019t have to deal with it. They act as if it\u2019s an inconvenience on THEIR part, even though this is their job\u2026\n\nIf you requested random roommates, congratulations, they pair you with the ones who don\u2019t meet your compatibility/ preferences whatsoever. Mine was the complete opposite of me in regards to cleanliness, noise, having friends over, pets, etc. Then they expect YOU to figure it out when there\u2019s conflict, even though the pairing was done on THEIR part. Don\u2019t even bother indicating your preferences on that little \u201cRoommate Matching\u201d sheet because it makes zero difference.\n\nThe first time I got my keys, I was paired with a MALE. I\u2019m a female\u2026 which apartment complex pairs males with females? That just goes to show they don\u2019t even look at the preferences you provide in regards to floor level or roommates. So I had all my stuff ready to move in, but I had to be delayed because of the FIRST mispairing on their part.\n\nI moved into another unit but realized soon enough that this female and I would not work as roommates. You can\u2019t randomly put people together and \"force them\" to work things out. Some people are just NOT meant to live together\u2026 There are things such as pets, having guests over, and electricity use etc that people just aren\u2019t willing to compromise for. After my roommate situation got out of hand, I again went to management demanding a new room assignment. He sat down with my roommate and I and we still couldn\u2019t resolve our issues. He first told us to just \"put up with it\u201d  until our lease ends. Oh okay, so I\u2019m paying $600 a month to \u201cput up with\u201d someone who\u2019s making my place basically UNLIVABLE for me. Y\u2019all, I\u2019m not lying when I say I would have to look for excuses to be out. I felt as if the place wasn\u2019t even mine\u2026 and hated being there because I felt uncomfortable. Anyway, so he FINALLY agreed to move me out into another unit. So that weekend, I packed up all my stuff, said sayonara to my roommate \u2026 and guess what? I NEVER heard anything back from them. I tried to get in contact with them multiple times and\u2026 nothing. They lied to my face, and when I came back to them AGAIN regarding roommate issues, they acted as if they did nothing wrong on their part.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1534359607043, "text": "Tahseen, thank you for your feedback.

When moving in they told me that the keys to my apartment had not been cut yet that I would need to wait in line for 45 minutes. it was actually closer to two hours. Then I get to my apartment to find that my bedroom door was kicked in and had no way to lock it, they where made aware of it immediately. (it took weeks for them to come and half way fix it). Also there was a roach infestation in every room and my roommates and I had filled a maintenance request on it multiple times. I then went to the office and the bug people came later that week. It took about four weeks for them to actually go away. The apartment was supposed to be newly renovated and mine was not. It has patched walls where someone had started to repair the walls and didn't sand them down or paint over them (this is in every room). the walls are covered in stains and sticky stuff and it does take a while for maintenance requests to get done. The towing people also love to screw you. If you do not have you tag hanging up even if it is on your dashboard they will tow you. I saw an older guy hooking my car up and went downstairs to explain to him that it was right there and he said that it would be $50 because he had already hooked it up or $100 if he towed it. of course I paid it. The security here sucks because it wasn't even 12 am yet and there was domestic dispute/violence and you could hear the female screaming but no one was around to do anything until the cops where called. Also if you choose random roommates they do not do a good job picking them out.

Most apartment complexes inspect units and ensure everything is in functional shape before a tenant moves in. This is not the case for The Social. I had somewhere in the range of 8 work orders just from day one. Dryer wasn't hooked up, kitchen sink didn't work, ice maker didn't work, garbage disposal didn't work, half our lights didn't turn on and the list goes on. It was roughly 2 months before the Social actually addressed some of these issues, and it took a heated email to corporate and literally CC emails to everyone in the company. There excuse was they only had 2 maintenance men for 1000 units, as if other complexes around Auburn don't have that many.  When they were repaired they were not fixed correctly and I ended up having to go back and fix their mistakes.\n\nThe unit wasn't clean on move in. I bought a $20 vacuum at Walmart did 5 passes on the carpet and the bin was full.  Our countertop was charred and burned and so was the carpet, neither of which was replaced during the stay. The day of move in about 6 guys in \"The Social\" worker shirts , not sure if they were maintenance just spent the day seeing how long they could keep the maintenance golf cart doing a wheelie. Not professional, and definitely a waste on man hours for the company.\n\nThere was never a maintenance schedule to the units, I had to remind them each time that they needed to replace the air filter for the AC unit. The unit itself was an old R22 unit that costs more to run than that in my previous unit that was three times size. The light bulbs in the unit are a round fluorescent type that cost a small fortune to replace and barely produce enough light to see in the living room.\n\nThe majority of the office staff are rude, and love to place blame on others. They had blatantly lied to my face about packages arriving simply because they didn't want to go find it. Many times I had asked to see the property manager, and the simple response was that \"he is on the property but not in the office.\" I said I'll wait for him to get back and they claimed he probably wouldn't be back and they could only contact him if it was some sort of emergency. I eventually got ahold of him by CC an email to his boss and his boss's boss. As a business this is extremely fishy way to operate and train your employees. They lost our check as well and then proceed to try and evict us, then blatantly ignoring us in the office when we went to confront them. Even with check receipts from them written in their handwriting and with their signature they did not believe us.\n\nTo continue their *optional* utility subcontractor made a clerical error,  and charged everyone for power even though we didn't sign up for the service.  Instead of the head office taking care of there contractor all at once the property manager instructed the office workers to tell the residence to handle it themselves. I had no affiliation with their contractor, and yet again they wanted me to do their job for them.\n\nThe general property is not taken care of. Many railings and posts along the steps are missing, along with the wood that is all splintered and heavily cracking. They have a poor locking system on the  basketball and exercise rooms where anyone with the code can get in. So when  people from other neighborhoods come in and trash it they blame and punish all their residence for there inability to provide a halfway decent secure locking system. Most of the equipment in the gym didn't work anyway, so no real loss there. There is 1 dumpster for about 3/4 of the apartments that is a very long walk away compared to most complexes.\n\nThe only pro I can think of is they did have a bowl of mints in the club house, most of which were stale but still edible.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1534359607670, "text": "Thank you for your feedback.

It took over 2 weeks to actually see maintenance after submitting several work orders the first day. If you ask anyone at the front desk anything, prepare for at least 3 different answers and for none of them to be correct. As previously mentioned, the internet they provide is excruciatingly slow. Don't expect to be able to play any kinds of online games or watch Netflix without serious buffer times. Parking is TERRIBLE for visitors. There are only 105 guest parking spots for everyone in the apartment complex. So don't expect to be able to have more than one friend over without them getting towed. I recommend The Social for anyone who wants to legitimize ongoing anger issues.\n\nUPDATE: Well they had forgotten to post electricity on our bill. So once they finally noticed, we got a notice on our door saying that they would charge us $40 a month per month they missed. This is insane.

When I initially moved in my washer nor dryer worked, my toilet did not flush, only two of the things on the stove worked. All of this the first day of moving in, I had to report my issues a few times before someone was sent to fix them, I understood due to them having only one maintenance guy and he is super nice. Even with these issues I overlooked them because the apartment was nice and ok for the price. As time went on I had numerous issues with billing and them adding charges for electricity to my account multiple times for no reason resulting in large fees that I had to pay to them out of pocket when my electricity was hooked up with Alabama Power and has been. I still overlooked these things, but other things continued to break. My dryer still does not work properly I have to start the dryer over 3-4 times for it to dry clothing which makes doing laundry extremely long. The renovations to the apartment makes it look better and worth the amount I'm paying, however, WiFi is included in the rent and stated as such in my lease but I have been without WiFi in my apartment since the beginning of May and I have contacted them about this and they stated for me to call and send a technician out but a technician has not came out and I have been contacting Charter back and forth for over a month now. If you bring your own router you can connect to the WiFi and establish your own WiFi for your apartment. This was working perfectly fine with me until their workers came to redo the carpeting and flooring in the apartment. Now for me to have the personal WiFi that I had in the past I will have to PAY CHARTER MYSELF FOR WIFI MONTHLY WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. If I'm paying Charter for WiFi then there is no reason that it should be in my rent, the $49 I have to pay Charter should be deducted from my rent. The office staff is really nice but they don't understand a lot of things and aren't much help with things outside of paying rent and the front office. On numerous occasions I have went to them for packages that we delivered and that they signed for and they would tell me that they did not have my package and I would not get it for 2-3 days when they finally decided to do some work and sort through the packages. They don't do much work and rarely are doing anything when you enter the clubhouse. I initially love living at The Social due to it being in a great location, good parking, and located very close to campus. But now I am beginning to regret resigning to live yet again at this nightmare of a place. Whenever there is an issue the property manager of office staff will attempt to contact you to save face but ultimately won't try to fix anything.

Other than that, nothing major.\n- Move-in day was cluster of craziness with double parking everywhere making it difficult to navigate, but that was only a one-day thing - management was a bit disorganized that day I must admit.\n- Apartment lights weren't very bright\n\nAnd now the GOOD:\n- Brand new carpet - very nice\n- Staff for the most part is quite nice\n- Pretty area\n- Close to campus\n- Lots of restaurants, shopping areas, gas stations and the like nearby\n- Open space to park your car\n- Love the bus transit system that runs every 15min-20min\n- Basic appliances work fine\n- Excellent value for the $$$\n- Lots of amenities include in such a low price\n\nI don't understand the mass amount of negative reviews - maybe the old management/maintenance team really was bad, who knows.

However, here are some good things about the Connection:\nThe maintenance guys are quick to come fix problems.\nThe price is competitive.\nManagement is pretty nice.\nThey have a lot of resident events.\n\nOn the other hand, some negatives:\nCleanliness: when my roommates and I moved in, all of our rooms and bathrooms were dirty. There was an abundance of hair in my dresser, mold in our bathrooms, and we had to scrub, not just wipe, every common surface. I\u2019ve never had this experience with an apartment complex.\n\nCommunication: The complex does not notify us of many maintenance repairs; recently, we had the shower heads and sink faucets replaced (unfortunately, these replacements were major downgrades from the nice high pressure shower heads we used to have); we never got any emails or notifications that they would be coming, and it was a bit startling when people enter our apartment unannounced. This has happened a few times over the past year.\n\nAmenities: the amenities are poorly maintained. The grills are dirty, the chairs are dirty, and really anything but the pool in the front and the clubhouse is run down. The gate rarely actually works, it stays open most of the time. If I had to estimate, it was working properly for maybe a total of a month over the past year. I don\u2019t care for the gate, it wasn\u2019t a selling point for me, but if you advertise yourself as a gated complex, maybe your gate should work.\n\nLighting: the parking lots are lit incredibly poorly and I feel uncomfortable walking to and from my car at night.\n\n\u201cSecurity\u201d: On two accounts in the evening, I have been sitting in my car, or standing outside my car in the parking lot, being quiet and nothing of a nuisance, just enjoying the fresh air. On both accounts, security told me I had to go inside.

It's distance from campus was acceptable due to the price being so low, but with the price increase of $70 for the same place it is impossible to recommend. The wifi has always been problematic, but manageable so I'm glad that they are upgrading it (it was long overdue). The difference between the 2 and 4 bedroom was negligible considering the price difference so the 4 bedroom is really the only good option. The hardwood floor in the 2 bedroom I had was absolute garbage, I mean it was stained with paint and was chipped in multiple places, and that doesn't even mention the hardwood itself was like plastic more than it was wood. The appliance where all great, but the heating and ac always seemed to act up. Which wouldn't have been a big deal if they fixed it in a timely fashion. The selection in terms of the fitness machines is lackluster. The walls are paper thin and the big gap under the doors sure doesn't help. You can hear pretty much everything from all the neighbors.

When I first moved to the complex, I was in a three bedroom and had absolutely no problem.  Fast forward to the next year, and I moved into a two bedroom.  When I first moved in, there was visible patching on multiple walls, warped floors, and not a single baseboard in the kitchen or bathrooms.  I went back and forth with the property manager for multiple months of false promises for fixing it.  A few months after that, I noticed mold in my closet and soaked carpet.  Okay, called maintenance, and the next day, I received a notification that the issue had been fixed .  NOPE.  For a whole week, I was back and forth with maintenance with this issue until I skipped a whole school day to make sure they did their job.  Sure enough, within thirty seconds, my closet wall shared with the bathroom starts gushing water from within.  Finally gets fixed, but they did a half way job of fixing the wall they had to tear down, and the shelving is not near as secure as it should be.  Fast forward again to the new management and other changes.  The internet NEVER works, even with an Ethernet cable, there is a huge pest problem (my roommate and I put in a complaint about mice, and it took three weeks and a day for them to even get Cook's out there to put down GLUE TRAPS even though pest control is supposed to be by once a week), and never have I ever had so many packages and mail go missing.

I moved into a 3 bedroom last year. On move-in day the carpet in the common area was completely disgusting with black stains all throughout the apartment. The carpet was coming apart from the flooring in several places. The entire apartment, including all three bedrooms, were filled with dust and looked as if they had been unoccupied for a very long period. The bathroom had mold in the bathtub and sink and the bathroom cabinets were flaking and falling apart. They didn\u2019t even fill the holes in the wall left from the previous occupants TV wall mount. The bedroom had cobwebs in two corners of the ceiling. The mattress smelled like pure body odor. The outside patio/balcony had cigarettes all over it, even though we were in a non smoking unit. There is about a 2-4 inch gap between all the doors which means you can literally hear anything and everything your roommates are doing. Our kitchen sink had a constant link the entire time we lived in the unit. We contacted management and nothing was ever done about any of the issues. You\u2019re very lucky if your maintience request is completed in a timely manner. After move out they tried to charge us for carpet replacement even though the carpet had been in horrible condition when we moved in. We actually hired a carpet cleaner so the carpet was in better condition when we left. They tried to use new carpet and appliances as a selling point to get us to re-sign, now they\u2019re trying to charge us for everything. These people have no clue what they\u2019re doing.

Make no mistake, this apartment complex is absolutely terrible. I lived here for 4 years, and had constant problems with management losing/returning my mail without explanation, threatening us with fines for keeping items on the porch of the apartment we paid to rent (\"Unsightly Balcony\" was the official \"charge\"), maintenance requests taking close to 2 weeks to be addressed.)\nFeatures that were used as selling points stayed in disrepair (front and back gates were constantly breaking, forcing you to drive all the way down S college to go around if one was closed; hot tub was never working for more than 3 months the entire time I lived there) or were \"closed\" via security patrols after 9:00 (pool, basketball court). If you're not a fan of having the cops called on you for playing basketball in your own apartment complex, seek other arrangements.\n\nThe most recent and irreconcilable complaint I have, however, is The Connection's predatory move-out practices. After 4 years of occupancy, never having missed a month's rent, my roomated and I were told that we owed over $2,000 in combined move-out expenses to cover the slight cosmetic damage to the paper-thin, cheaply made couches they provide, very minor scuffs along the walls, and \"cleaning costs\".

If I had bothered to tour any other apartment complex in Auburn before deciding to live here, I would have chosen anything else. The staff was rude to my parents when they called to check on a problem I was having with the place. They have been very rude to me on occasion. They're very young and not helpful at all. I've had too many bad experiences to even count. My roommate and I are counting down the days until our lease is up. We have even heard other residents saying the same thing. The furniture is horrible. We pretty much slide off the couch every time we sit on it. The wifi is atrocious. I can never get anything done because it is always flickering on and off. Charter also stinks. My channels flicker out on me too. I know they claim to be a \"gated community\", but can you really call yourself that when your gates only work half the time? Once while walking to the transit, I saw a confrontation between a few residents and police officers who were swarming the place. I was freaked out when a guy tried to run away and the cop slammed him on the ground. I thought I was about to get shot or something. A couple days later I went into the office and asked what all the commotion was about. After all, I live here. I have a right to know. At first, the worker looked at me like I was stupid for asking. When I asked again, she was like \"Oh, just a confrontation. We got it settled.\" They're just very unhelpful. Then, we had an ant problem and didn't get it resolved for TWO WEEKS. The gym and pool are the only redeeming qualities. I can't wait to get out of here. Literally counting down the days.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3b98240b121:0xd0895806d3612fdd"}

I'm glad I'm leaving this place in August. First, we negotiate with the property when we sign the contract. We need two sets of houses that are next to each other because we have eight partners. Connotation promised us, but! ! They did not achieve it. Under my understanding, my other friends encountered the same problem. They are also separated. Second, when we registered, we requested apartments that live on the second floor and above, but! ! ! The property gave us the first floor and now my room has a lot of bugs. Outside the windows on the first floor there are flowers and in the summer there are many bees. This makes me very troubled. Third, when we registered, we were misled and chose to pay for parking spaces. However, since we stayed here, they have not mentioned this issue to me. They gave me an ordinary parking permit and continued to charge. When I discovered this problem, I came to the property to find help. The front desk recorded my problem very friendly and did not help me. I will still be charged until next month! ! ? ? ? When I was looking for management, they doubted the authenticity of my problem and repeatedly asked me to check my license to ensure that they did not make mistakes. Until I provided all the photos to the managers, they promised to cancel the next month's fees. but! ! They will not give me the cost before returning. I did not enjoy the proper parking spaces and it was their fault. They refuse to admit it. I am sorry for this place. Finally, the electricity bill made me understandable. In the first few months, our electricity bill was maintained at $150. Even if we often use air conditioning. but! ! ! In the last winter vacation, I was alone at home, and my electricity bill reached $300. In the following month, the electricity bill was still $300 until we completely shut down the air conditioner. This change was sudden and huge, which made me very shocked and unacceptable. My advice is to stay away from this place. Its service is not as imaginative as it is irresponsible! And so on, during the last winter vacation, the door of our laundry suddenly fell. It hurt my friend. I confirmed that we didn't touch it, and that its junction was broken.

Let me just tell you SOME of my experiences over the years.\n1. The apartments aren't really that clean when you move in, you can still have someone's stuff still in drawers and things like that.\n2. You're suppose to get a notice that people are coming into your apartment. There have been MULTIPLE instances people just show up, luckily I was home. However! One time I didn't hear the door and they just walked right in. They never sent any type of email they were coming or put anything on the door.\n3. Maintenance is slow and important. I promise you SOMETHING is going to break in your apartment. It's all cheap. My dryer, dish washer, AC, toilet has all broken and for all of them it took us having to bug them for them to even come up in a timely manner... ESPECIALLY for the AC that broke in the middle of the summer.\n4. Black \"stuff\" grows in all of the bathroom drains. They claim it's just \"dirty\" but I've never seen this black stuff ever in my life. Just here at the connection.\n5. The office staff can be friendly depending who you talk to, but management is truly useless.\n6. They will find anything and everything to charge you for. They're definitely here to take your money.\n7. When I moved in I was told every year you stay and resign your lease rent will go down. That's what kept me here for 3 years. However I'm now moving out because they started raising prices and I promise.. ITS NOT WORTH IT!\n8. The \"security guard\" they have here is rude. I asked him a simple question about when the club house closed and he gave me a very rude response and laughed at me.\n9. The hot tub has been broken forever. It's not even clean. It's truly disgusting.  Half the equipment in the gym is broken. Last time I went to the computer lab, more than half the computers didn't work and the printer didn't work either. The pool table and ping pong table are both broken in the club house, make sure not to lean on them. Almost all the chairs at the pools are broken and the ones that you're suppose to be able to sit in in the water are never cleaned so they have definitely grown some bacteria.\n10. The front gate is always broken. If you're looking for a safe place with a gate and security, this isn't the place.

She wouldn't take him out before she left in the morning and when she left she was gone for majority of the day, so he would end up going to the bathroom in the apartment. I ended up taking care of him so much that it felt like he had became my dog and I don't do small dogs. The only good thing that came out of it was that the apartment itself was nice after it had been cleaned up, the bathtub was a very nice plus, and I basically had a pool view without paying the pool view price. It is also very convenient to interstate when the gate is working, location is fantastic. It's a great place to live if you have the patience to put up with management and going over those dang speed bumps. Wish I could stay where I'm at, but I don't have the mind nor the patience to deal with management.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3b98240b121:0xd0895806d3612fdd"}

The Connection is easily the worst place I have lived in, I cannot stress this enough. Take your money somewhere else and save yourself many headaches and stress. If you don\u2019t have the time to read my whole review with all the details, then just take a look at all the other reviews to get an idea of the quality of this place. And don\u2019t be fooled by the 5 star reviews you see in the last year, because the connection offered the residents $100 dollars in exchange for a positive review. This is how desperate they are to make themselves look good. It should also give you an idea of how duplicitous their style of management truly is. They invest money, time, and effort into putting up a front and tricking people to sign-in instead of using that time to actually do their work properly and fix their current problems.\nI lived with them for 2.5 years. My first year with them was ok, and I had no issues. However, everything started to go wrong when the new manager, Matthew, came in. This is why you should avoid this place at all costs:\n1) Incorrect Late Fees and payment problems:\nAll apartment complexes have a resident portal where you can pay your rent online. These portals also allow you to save payment methods so that you don\u2019t have to re-enter your payment information every month. I made my payments with the checking account of my bank (NOT my debit/credit card, because I don\u2019t have to worry about changing the payment information if it ever got lost or stolen). When you make a payment, you receive a message and an email telling you that the payment went through. One day during my last semester with them, I received an email informing me of the following: My payments for the last two months had been rejected, that I had over $300 dollars in late fees, that they tried to reach me by calling me and by going to my apartment, and that if I did not made the full payment of that last two months plus late fees and charge back fees in the next 3 days, I would be evicted! I had no records in my phone of any calls being made to me from them, and I\u2019m never at my apartment during business hours because I\u2019m in the Auburn campus. But they could not be bothered to email me about this until 3 days before I would get evicted! They waited more than 70 days to send me a freaking email, and gave me less than a week to pay them. I immediately told them that I will pay the two months of rent but that I will not pay any extra charges or fees. I proved to them that I received a confirmation email from them for both payments. Apparently, that email was worthless, because that email only means that your payment request went through, not that the bank transferred the money. They told me that I must have made a mistake when filling out my payment information. I proved to them that this is impossible because  I used my saved Checking account to pay, the same account that I have used for the last 2 years without any issues. Then, they told me that the payments did not go through because I did not have enough money in the bank at the time of the payments! So now I had to give them proof of my bank records of the last two months to show them that at the time of the payment, I had more than enough money in my account. I felt like I was had to be a lawyer to not get overcharged by these people. But what really made me mad is that after all this proof, they still had to \u201ctalk\u201d to their upper management to check on this. They proceeded to tell me that they wanted a freaking bank representative to basically prove to them that the bank did not make a mistake. Ridiculous! They could not admit that their online portal had a glitch or messed up. I had to invest too much time and effort in order to not get screwed over.\nThere is not enough space for me to write everything I want. So here are the highlights:\n2) Incorrect parking charges 3) Inorrect Fees After Moving Out 4) Rent Kept Rising 5) Horrible communication with management 6) Bad Maitenance 7) you can hear everything", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1544482061170, "text": "Hello Joan,\n\nWe are sorry to hear about your frustrations with our property.

The floors were installed looking scuffed and the countertops are great at hiding spills and messes so be sure to clean often. The 40\" smart TV is nice if your roommates don't mind the noise, and the extra deep sinks are fantastic for hand washing dishes better than the dishwasher ever will.\n\nManagement doesn't communicate with the residents well, when they bother communicating at all. Even the people at the office are left out of the loop so you can hardly ever get straight answers from them, though they are always nice and never at fault themselves.\n\nThey cut bike locks and took all bikes off the property on short notice, while students were away on break, and have not been able to provide an adequate place for locking up bikes despite initially repeating promises of new equipment \"next week\" or \"in a few days.\"\n\nMaintenance has always been wonderful for me. They're always busy so you should expect to wait one or two business days, but I've never had to wait longer than two for any issue big or small.\n\nThe back gate is always padlocked and the front gate is always broken and left open. Don't let them fool you into thinking they finally fixed it, it will likely fail again after a few days and is a lost cause.\n\nJunk mail is a huge problem. There are literal buckets of overflowing junk mail at every set of mail boxes.\n\nThe internet provider, Airwaves, was bought out by Single Digits and the connection on our (recently upgraded) networks have become unreliable. The connection became slow and intermittent overnight. Basic security procedures are not provided for guests and the connection is even worse if you don't register your MAC addresses online, which can be a glitchy process requiring a call to tech support.\n\nI will no longer be recommending The Connection to others.\n\nOriginal review w/ 5 stars c. 2016:\nThe rent isn't bad for what you get. My apartment is clean and hasn't had any issues. Management can be tough to deal with, but it's even worse at most other places. The key is to go to the office yourself and speak with someone in person, and keep coming back. I had trouble even signing my lease; errors with the website and repeated phone calls with different staff. But on my first visit about the issue everything was sorted out and on the second I had my lease signed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547506126995, "text": "Good Afternoon Chase,\n\nThank you for the review, I will try to address your concerns in the order mentioned!\n\nFor most properties, rent will change from year to year. To keep up with the ever-evolving market, we decided to renovate last year. These renovations included installing hardwood flooring throughout the entire unit, replacing the previous countertops with granite in both the kitchen and bathrooms, putting in new sink fixtures in the kitchen and bathrooms, and setting up a 55\" tv in the common area of each renovated unit. While not everyone will appreciate these renovations equally, the majority will agree that they are both aesthetically pleasing and more practical.\n\nAs a management team, we do our best to make sure residents share the same knowledge that we do, whether it be through signage posted throughout the property, emails, etc. For the majority of updates, we will send an email to residents. To ensure you are receiving these emails, please make sure you are opted in to email updates in your resident portal. If you need any help changing this setting, please let us know!\n\nStoring bikes in the breezeway of the buildings is not only unsightly, but also a fire hazard. Resident safety is of great importance to us. With this in mind, we required residents to either remove their bikes from the breezeway or we removed them. However, upon removal, we stored the bikes for about two months and gave residents the option to have them returned for free.\n\nWe are glad to hear that your experience with maintenance has been so wonderful! While each issue varies, it is nice to hear that maintenance has always responded in a timely manner.\n\nYou are correct that the back gate was locked for a short time period around the summer. At the time, our gate contractor was unable to get to the property immediately and we made the decision to lock the back gate with resident safety in mind. Otherwise, the gate was able to be opened with or without an access device. With all technology, there are issues that inevitably occur. We have actually recently spoken with our gate contractor and they will be here by the end of the week to take a look at the gate. We will work with them to make sure this is not a routine occurrence!\n\nWe completely understand your frustration with junk mail. Unfortunately, with the amount of companies who advertise through mail, there is not much we can do on our end. To encourage residents not to litter any junk mail, we set up bins by each mailbox area for disposal of junk mail.\n\nFor any internet issues, Single Digits has asked that we advise residents to reach out to them by phone at (877) 778-9283. The internet service being provided is the same that was provided by Airwaves. However, we have reached out to Single Digits to see if there is anything we can do on our end to help and are waiting to hear back.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate everything you mentioned in your review and hope that we helped clarify some of your concerns. If you have any future recommendations or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at (334) 821-3301 or info@connectionauburn.com.

The people here are all extremely nice, including the cleaning staff and RAs, and things are almost always quiet. It's a suite style dorm, so you have your own room and share a common area with 2-4 roommates. A good bit of furniture is provided, but I'd recommend bringing a card table at least for the main area, as well as a coffee table, as the provided side desk isn't very good. My room had a few different problems, including smelly air conditioning, a closet that smelled literally like cat pee, and a main area light that was extremely dim (had to buy three different lights to evenly light the room). I submitted all three of these problems as work orders, and the first two were solved really quickly (the next day). The light, however, literally took two weeks to get a replacement for, and is still unusually dim. Water pressure is also routinely a problem if you're on the fifth floor. The trash chutes are never open, which means that people leave their trash in the trash rooms and it smells whenever you walk by. Other than all this, though, this is probably the best place to live while on campus. If you have a bad roommate here, it's not as much of a problem as it is having one at new freshman or even Ridgecrest East as the two sides are separated. 10/10 would stay again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602a349e87527:0x9a2ead4637f42e84"}

This review is for the Ridgecrest Village as a whole, including South, East and West.\nAll three buildings are honors only dorms (that is, only students in the honors college) with 4 bedroom suites: in South (which houses both the North and South tower), each person gets their own 9' by 11' private bedroom (twin XL bed, desk, dresser, nightstand with drawer and locking cabinet, tv jack, Ethernet, phone line) and the suite shares a 12' by 14' living room (tv stand, tv jack, Ethernet, phone jack, high table with 2 tall chairs, couch, and 2 side tables) and a kitchenette (full refrigerator, microwave, and ample counter and cabinet space) amongst the 4 total roommates. Each suite also has 2 full bathrooms, which you share with one of your roommates. Before you move in, you fill out a roommate profile on the housing match site, where you can talk with several others with similar interests/living habits/study schedules/etc., and pick who you want to live with. As you get to know your roommates (generally several months) before you move in, most people will discuss who will bring what for the room (TV, wall hangings, curtains, whatever else you may want). East and West give you a little bit more room (but with a slightly smaller kitchen and showers) and an extra storage room. East and West are also a bit quieter, but South had nicer common areas, like the atrium, game room, and media room.\nIn all 3 buildings, there are a few 2 bedroom suites, however these are very limited and full up quickly. They are also smaller, and I personally prefer the 4 bedroom.\nAll 3 buildings also have several handicap accessible rooms, with larger bedrooms, bathrooms, accessible shower, and doorbell with a bright flashing light inside. There are also 2 elevators in each tower and multiple in East and West if they are needed. There may be additional accessibility features I am not aware of at this point.\nIn South, the laundry ($1.50 per wash and $1.25 per dryer- same across campus except international student living) and community kitchens (2 full ranges, 2 ovens, fire suppression system, 2 full refrigerators, and a seating area) are on the 2nd and 4th floors. The second floor also houses the atrium (used for several larger events put on by the college, and also used for group projects and studying), game and media rooms, so these suites fill up quickly. The 5th floor rooms all have extra tall ceilings, and several have an extra foot or 2 on the living room and bedrooms as they extend outwards from the building.\nIf you bring a car/truck, (which Alabama actually allows freshman to do) and you stay in any of the Ridgecrest dorms, you will be parking it in the parking garage underneath South, but it isn't more than a 90 second walk from either of the other 2 buildings.  If you prefer, there are several other lots you can park in if your vehicle doesn't fit, but the clearance is 7'8\" with fairly large spots so most cars/trucks will fit. In all of the other dorms I can think of, you have to park elsewhere.  Ridgecrest is the only dorm village with built in parking for students (except handicap).\nMany of then off campus housing options (which almost everybody takes with the exception of RAs and athletes) are nicer and less expensive, but as far as freshman dorms, Ridgecrest is by far my favorite.\nOverall, you honestly can't go wrong with any place in the Ridgecrest village. The other suite style dorms (presidential, lakeside, riverside) are very similar, and very nice, but are for both honors and non-honors students.

They get the residents to leave good reviews in exchange for free items through out the year. I work in housing and this is typically found as a bad practice by a bad company and typically looked down upon. I don\u2019t typically do this but since I saw the good reviews I thought it was great. Let\u2019s start from the beginning. I moved in and had already completed all move in paper work before getting there including my dog information and paid the pet deposit. I get there the day of move in and they say my dog cannot move in because they \u201clost the paper work\u201d after a few hours of arguing I finally was able to move in in order to find my copy of all the paper work. We move in and the place is a mess nothing had been cleaned the carpets had stains everywhere. It was horrible I had never seen anything like it. They said they cleaned it which is weird since I could find tons of syrup or something spilt in the cabinets. I also found tons of dirty spots on the carpet through out the house. When I get to my room there was stains that looked like bleach stains which were easy to see since My bed was completely missing... my door was broke to the bathroom. Then come to find out the toilet was leaking. They never fixed the toilet i put in at least three work orders but it never got fixed so I just had to leave a cup under there and dump it every day so it would ruin my stuff... it wasn\u2019t fixed until they changed out toilets for the entire community. Save yourself the trouble don\u2019t live here was the worse experience of my college career would rather or lived in the dorm again.... I will add pics if I can..", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRXgIqxxt9udd4IdVJm2l-tXq9CIb_ZCB_fZoD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN33y_ouy6FFvlhGOY-ZUDD5j14mKGPJEDISqUu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmAPVRj6L4u1XgTV2rR3bLxnkp3NAnQVL7MUdt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5c9YorX-_WddN9L8MGpaWM9up2PbvJa_CLef2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6fbsO2mbV9uvpbDscAbfQnkulHW6XwPxZ0JG6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk3et7ZcXPrf6fIopSKnKibKsFdNzK9GULyxph=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUwFug81j_j0xX4-dOUxvji3tXnGvBga4KfCr2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4Pi3jGXXCBPNhObA7uNb_sSCnr4tKnu2II1OQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0Pl7T9XeBsaQK8GZrSPZ-z6X6-XcozM_mv6ib=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdClKF2svm_Zm-E-cjgk4EAkJ5tTlgbedRNyfd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1598893227800, "text": "Christopher, thank you for your feedback.

I\u2019m not sure if our meter is messed up but after the first bill we went the rest of the year with the AC turned completely off, only 1 tv in the house, and normal light usage and had overages every month.... probably the most annoying thing, and what may be a much bigger issue with COVID pushing classes online, is that the internet will cut out across the cottages.

It is the elite package and I live upstairs.\n\nMy experience at the cottages has been no less than excellent. While it isn\u2019t the cheapest place in Tuscaloosa to live, it easily provides the most value, and I\u2019ve been so happy with my stay so far.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know if you are considering the cottages:\n-You live right on the lake which is hands down the best place in the world to relieve stress or to pray if you\u2019re the type.\n-The staff is very friendly, but sometimes don\u2019t really know what they are talking about (I asked about hours last month and got 3 different answers from two people at the front desk). I will say I am sympathetic to them because they are students like me and have not been working there for a number of years like you would get in a non-college town.\n-There are multiple events a semester which, depending on where your cottage is located and when the event is relative to your exams can be either a blessing or a curse. There was a concert that was pointed right at my cottage not too long ago that really disrupted my ability to focus on my studying.\n-I have to pay $15 a month extra because my closet is huge. At first I thought this was outrageous, but having utilized my closet as an office space/storage area and set up a gaming space in my actual bedroom, the $15 a month is justified for the luxury of having so much extra space.\n-You may hear other people complaining about the upstairs being hot and the downstairs being cold. If you have ever lived in a two story building, that is just how temperatures work. Could the buildings have been planned better? As an engineer, the answer I\u2019ll give you is always yes. Would it drastically improve the state of the temperature in your cottage? No, but it would drive your rent price higher.\n-If I had one extra roommate, our parking situation would be awful, but I\u2019m fortunate to have exactly the correct number of spaces around us. The workaround for this is to buy a reserved space for $10/month. They will set up a sign in your front yard and you will always have a spot. That\u2019s 100% worth it in my eyes so I never have to deal with searching for a parking spot coming home from the library at 1 am.\n-You will be late to class if you don\u2019t leave at least 20-25 minutes early, sometimes 35 if your class is on the far side of campus.\n\nAll in all, your experience at this complex is what you make of it. You only share walls with people you can control. The pool is okay, but the lake is incredible. Nucor Steel ruins any chance at seeing the stars in all their glory because of how bright the steel mill is at night, but laying out on the bank of the lake at night under the sky is still a blissful experience that I seek out regularly regardless of temperature. There are plenty of events and giveaways if that\u2019s what you are looking for. Find good, CLEAN roommates, and you\u2019ll have a wonderful experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580490479258, "text": "Thank you so much for your thorough review, David!!

The second year their carpet was in bad shape and some woodwork was chewed up by a prior tenant's pet.  We actually did a good job on the move-out cleaning.  The other two roommates did not.  The roommates got assessed about $200 on move-out, even though one of their bathrooms had mold.  We got assessed over $600.\n\nWe emailed and called repeatedly to explain and try to negotiate.  They wouldn't take our calls and we got nowhere with the emails.  We sent over $200 and then sent another $260, which we thought was more than fair, considering the bad condition on move-in.  They sent us to a collection agency that\u2019s now calling and bothering us constantly.  If you move in, make sure to take lots of photos of any damage that was pre-existing!

We assess damages based on the move in condition form that is turned in at the beginning of the lease term and compare\u00a0it to the condition of the unit upon move out.

We did offer a settlement to you, however you paid the amount that you saw fit and unfortunately we could not accept that.

You will see a few reviews about how fast they are to respond, but this is only when small things break. Most houses have at least one major issue throughout the year since they are so cheaply built (we had a burst pipe and a shattered glass door) and these issues take forever to resolve. I attached pictures from my bathroom where I had a hole leading outside for 2 weeks. The contractors arrived when no one was home with no warning from the Retreat. They tore out drywall near the leak and didn't cover anything in the bedroom or bathroom so everything was covered in dust (computer, bed, toothbrush, tv, etc). At one point they didn't show up for 2 days and when I went to the main office I was told that the contractors reported that the work was done. They didn't believe me so I had to have someone from the office come look and see for themselves. \"Oh wow that's crazy,\" was their reaction. We have been waiting for our glass door to be fixed for almost 3 weeks now as well. The landscapers cracked the pane and we reported it the same day. Four days later glass was falling out each time the door was opened so we removed the broken pieces and duct taped the edges. The next day the duct tape was removed and more broken glass was on the porch. The main office told us they had tried to fix it but had the wrong sized pane. I don't expect it to be fixed until after we move out. Additionally, you will receive an overage for utilities every month. I don't know a single person living here who doesn't. Dealing with management is also hard because they hide behind the college students at the front desk who really aren't given enough responsibility to help you with any of your problems.

To start with you essentially have your own house which is so much better than having an apartment. I have dog and it simply doesn't get better for dog owners. I have a chocolate lab and she loves it. She has so much grass area to run around. The lake is amazing and it completely sets The Cottages apart. The most underrated feature is the 24/7 clubhouse that also has the computer lounge that you can use anytime. Turns out I procrastinate quite a bit, so it comes in handy.

Amenities are nice and the complex itself is really nice too. The area outside of the community is rough though. When I lived here, the staff was pretty meh. I think our biggest complaint about actually living there was their ever increasing restrictions on house parties. There really weren't any rules at first, but then they switched security staff and said all parties had to be ended by 2:00 am. Then it was 1:00 am. Then it was midnight. No idea what this policy is nowadays but that was pretty damn lame, considering its a college town and house parties are fairly common everywhere. When we moved out they hit us with some major fines. Some of it made sense, but some of it was stuff that needed to be done by that point anyway (like replacing carpeting and repainting walls. Yes, they use that awful flat paint that marks up when you look at it). They actually charged me to repaint my room and replace the carpet. I had expected these shenanigans so I provided photo proof that my room did not need to be repainted and I also provided proof that the carpet had never been replaced. I've heard that they do this to a lot of people, charging them for things they don't actually replace or repair. It must be really profitable to charge 2 or 3 people for the same carpet before they actually replace it. Overall, we really enjoyed our time in the Retreat. Had a lot of great memories there.

You will see a few reviews about how fast they are to respond, but this is only when small things break. Most houses have at least one major issue throughout the year since they are so cheaply built (we had a burst pipe and a shattered glass door) and these issues take forever to resolve. I attached pictures from my bathroom where I had a hole leading outside for 2 weeks. The contractors arrived when no one was home with no warning from the Retreat. They tore out drywall near the leak and didn't cover anything in the bedroom or bathroom so everything was covered in dust (computer, bed, toothbrush, tv, etc). At one point they didn't show up for 2 days and when I went to the main office I was told that the contractors reported that the work was done. They didn't believe me so I had to have someone from the office come look and see for themselves. \"Oh wow that's crazy,\" was their reaction. We have been waiting for our glass door to be fixed for almost 3 weeks now as well. The landscapers cracked the pane and we reported it the same day. Four days later glass was falling out each time the door was opened so we removed the broken pieces and duct taped the edges. The next day the duct tape was removed and more broken glass was on the porch. The main office told us they had tried to fix it but had the wrong sized pane. I don't expect it to be fixed until after we move out. Additionally, you will receive an overage for utilities every month. I don't know a single person living here who doesn't. Dealing with management is also hard because they hide behind the college students at the front desk who really aren't given enough responsibility to help you with any of your problems.

Our air conditioning didn't work for weeks in the summer when we moved in, our internet line was broken for months before they got someone to fix the line, and we went another month without a functional microwave. The untimeliness of response to these issues led our house to study for graduate exams without cool air, internet access to study, and other amenities promised to us when we signed. But don't worry, the maintenance man will dig through trash outside the never emptied compacter to slap a $200 fine that must be paid within 24 hours. There are constant overage bill miscalculations that overcharge and are only fixed if pressure is put on management.

As for your internet, you have to reach out to our internet provider, Pavlov, for repairs. Lastly, we have our compactors weighed and emptied on a weekly basis. There are two huge signs outside of phase 1's compactor that tell you not to place your trash outside of the compactor and if you do so, you will receive a $200 fine. We have a compactor in phase 2 to take your trash if phase 1 is ever full. As a courtesy, we have reduced the fine to $50 for you and your roommates.

The mystery charges on my bill, ridiculous utility overages while I am not even living there, and poor customer service are only a few reasons we are signing elsewhere after two years of living here. The staff is incredibly incompetent and often times rude, as I am sure they are getting tired of dealing with irate customers. For the same price after overages, you could easily live closer to campus. The amenities are a total joke (broken gym equipment) and they have lost mail before. Buyer beware,  you might talk yourself into looking past the distance from campus but I promise one day you will realize that this place is simply too far away and poorly run to be worth it.

Random fact- I know someone who met their now wife on The Retreat Bar Bus. (just saying) There is also a police officer on call 24/7 if you have any security problems. Yes there will be problems but they will be fixed. You will meet the most amazing people. And you will have the most beautiful pool in the state.

Yes  people who live here should clean it up (or better yet fine them like you say you are gonna do), but you also have people who work here to clean it up too, but the dumpster doesn\u2019t help when it\u2019s overflowing and all on the ground. Next safety, well my car has been broken into before and I have filed a report on it, y\u2019all didn\u2019t have the cameras working at the time anyways and I\u2019m gonna say it\u2019s because the gates that were \u201csuppose\u201d to be up 6 months ago have only been up for 2!\nNeighborhood parking sucks because you constantly have people who don\u2019t live here (we have decals) taking your spot and you have to end up walking a mile to get to your house.\nMaintaince, well let\u2019s just say if you have a leak coming from somewhere they will just paint over the leak and tell you it\u2019s nothing. Also I hope you know how to fix a dryer because I had to learn! Staff, yea they won\u2019t help either! You go up and ask for your package because it said it was signed off on your tracking number and they say well did we call you and I say no because you never call and it\u2019s always up at your office! I\u2019m not really gonna complain about the staff, it\u2019s not their fault that they are young and inexperienced in this type of stuff, they obviously need some help up there with someone older than 22. Also I\u2019m gonna pinpoint that I have a dog and I pick up my dogs poop when he does his business...so when I write a check for $300 dollars and put in the memo box PET AMMENDUM...it goes to the pet not my rent....which they put it towards my rent back in November (they have it in the system and I have a receipt) and then they proceeded to ask for another $300! If you want a place where you won\u2019t be lied to and you will actually get some decent respect...do NOT live here!

The amenities are great (when they are in service, which is not always), the location is perfect for me, it takes me 8 minutes to get parked on campus from my house if I take Jack Warner but is far enough away from campus when I want to be. It is reasonably quiet. The rent is high and there $50 utilities cap is never enough. I use minimum water and electricity and always seem to go over which is upsetting. My house was empty with only the refrigerator and ac running on 78 yet I still had over $50 in overages to pay. When I called to asked about this issue the staff told me that its better to go through conservice on my own but that would cause me and my roommate to lose our utilities cap that would be included in our rent anyway.

They advertise rent starting just under $600 but with monthly \"fees\" that no one could explain without wanting to bring in a lawyer my rent was always above $775. It even rose above $800 during January due to electric costs. These houses are not built to be energy savings in any way. Our average electric bill, for a house of 4 people, was over $320 every month with AC running about half the time. All the toilets and the dishwasher ran when I first moved in and it took 3 weeks and a call to a building inspector to get it fixed yet no comp was added to our $150 water bill. The local desk is run by kids, that I cant get upset with because they are just working for minimum, but they know nothing. They could not even tell me the name of the cable provider so I could request a repair service. Oh also cable, internet and phone are included in the rent and cannot be separated but youll be lucky to find a house that has all three working, or even finding two that work. My cable has never worked since move in but I gave up trying to get anything done about it. The local manager is a dolt. She gets paid in rent so she is expected to love the community but has no clue about anything. I got double charged twice for rent within the same month and she could not even tell me the name of the accountant who handled the rent. Getting a contact at the corporate office is a game in itself. The property has been bought and sold twice as long as I have lived here and that is only one year. The house itself is classic college living that I overpaid drastically for. I have 2 exposed, non working sockets in the living room since move in. I requested a repair and they just pulled the fuse saying they would get back to it. 10 months later I am still waiting. I have a broken kitchen light that has also not gotten repaired along with a leaking water heater, destroyed flooring and a kitchen cabinet. The upstairs porch railing even fell off during a storm and hit my girlfriend. Their version of repairs was to lock the door on us because it was unsafe to on it anymore. That porch was the reason I signed for the house initially. They also dont guarantee the random roommate process or have any safety protections. I had an ex random roommate move out over winter break because he had graduated. After clearing out, he broke back in and trashed the place as well as stealing everything that was not locked away. Even though he relinquished his keys, the property still had him listed as a tenant so us remaining roommates could not press charges. They even tried to bill us for the damaged door, although this was the one time I was able to get a charge removed with ease signifying that the local manager knows and has the power to do so. Upon refusal to resign our lease, the management team expedited the repair process and has already begun tearing out my kitchen and will be replacing it over the next two months. I have no kitchen for two months. The flashy gimmicks that initially drew me in, and I am sure  you, such as the clubhouse, lake and pool are just surface. The clubhouse has been \"under construction\" since august and is there but not private or usable space. The pool has been closed for a month now due to sewage leak and is not expected to open any time soon and the lake is disgusting, stagnant water. It is stocked but not well so fishing is difficult. Also there is a public access road cutting through the property to the lake so it isnt a private lake. Many public individuals walk by my house daily to get to the lake and left in unlocked houses and cars is common.\n\nAll in all I do not believe this place is worth looking. The price is comparable to higher end apartments, closer to campus and near the strip. You also dont incur the transportation costs such as a car, uber and a parking spot on campus. The expensive cost and poor management staff bring a three star review down to a one.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528207205888, "text": "Dalton, thank you for your feedback.

Get ready to play games.\n\nStay away from the Brookshires. Despite the huge closets upstairs, the house is only fitted with one AC unit, despite every other floor plan having two. The Retreat acknowledged last year that my AC wasn't strong enough to keep the upstairs sufficiently cooled in the summer, so nicely, they brought me a window unit to make it livable. This year however, I was told despite the precedent they set before, that they wouldn't be able to give me one again. The upstairs is a noticeable 7-8 degrees hotter now (April), and in the summer it can be as much as 10-15 degrees. Very dissapointed that the Retreat expects me to pay ~$400 for an AC to fix their houses poor design (I was given permission to purchase one, which I found laughable, considering I just want basic AC).\n\nAfter going to the leasing office ~10 times this year, I've had maybe one employee actually try to help me. Good luck talking to a manager and not a college student, the managers are miraculously always busy, no matter the time of day. The college students will look you straight in the face and tell you they'll have manager call you back, and it NEVER HAPPENS. I'm not sure if the students in front office don't care enough to actually reach out, or if management believes if they ignore you long enough you'll go away since you're \"just\" a college student. I've requested a statement from one of the managers in writing ~5 times. Every time I'm insured an email is forthcoming, and then, nothing.\n\nAlso, if you sign your lease a second time, it is hit or miss if they actually come by and fix anything. I called at least 7 times over the summer, asking them to come fix what was broken or messed up in the house, as they had done for all of our neighbors who resigned their leases, and yet again I was reassured over and over that they were on it, only to never come and leave us high and dry.\n\nI truly will never sign a lease again with the direction management has taken the Retreat this year. I only began having these problems this last year, my first year at the Retreat was great.\n\nEdited:Removing personal info, updating situations.\n\nUpdate: After finally working my way to management, they heard me out, while some concerns were taken care of, I'm still left with a bitter taste in my mouth after paying the high rent at the Retreat and being shafted as far as mid-summer clean-up goes.

After reviewing your account, I do not see where you were charged for any move out fees or wristbands. I understand that you have maintenance issues in your house and I am looking forward to receiving your email and working on getting those issues resolved for you.

Much like all the other tempting amenities offered by the retreat its nothing more than a front.\nLet me not leave you with a review, but with a story.\nYour first day at the retreat. You wake up at 7:01 exactly. The peaceful sounds of 40,000 birds aggressively chirping outside your window mix perfectly with the sound of landscapers yelling as they mow your grass. You walk downstairs and prepare breakfast. As you\u2019re cleaning up after your meal you rejoice as you realize there is no garbage disposal. You load your dishes into the Ancient dishwasher and begin your five mile trek to the nearest garbage bin so that you can dispose of your trash. Now it\u2019s time for class. As you stop by the clubhouse to print off important documents for class you\u2019re informed for the 20th time that the printer isn\u2019t working. This works out perfectly because in order to get to campus from the distant retreat you must leave no later than 48 hours before the start of class. This leaves you plenty of time to find another printer. You return from class eager to finish your favorite show on Netflix. Luckily for you the last time the retreat updated their Wi-Fi was when my grandfather was shot in WWII. I cannot stress this enough. THE WIFI IS TERRIBLE. Instead you turn on TV and flip through the retreat tv package which has a total of 4 channels.  Fear not, the clubhouse had so many exciting activities when you signed the lease, right? Wrong. The golf simulator hasn\u2019t worked since the resurrection of Jesus and the gym smells like a dead cat. At least the pool is amazing right? It\u2019s great until they shut it down to \u201cdrain\u201d for two months in the summer. I am not kidding. They do it every. Single. Summer. A smart company would drain the pool in the fall and winter months  when no one would be there. Luckily for you, retreat management is no ordinary company. Now it\u2019s nightfall and you feel like going out to the bars or going to get drinks and dinner. Perfect, just snag an uber and avoid having to drive altogether. Ubering to the retreat from the strip is NO LESS THAN $15 dollars. EVER.\nPlease, please, please god don\u2019t live here. Management is terrible, they lie to you on your tours, and will fine the living daylights out of you on every monthly bill they can. Please, please, please live anywhere else.\n\nEDIT: you'll notice how management responded to my review without addressing the issue and again lying to residents. 1) I have pictures documenting landscaping crews beginning as early as 6:50 which actually violates noise ordinances. When I tried bringing this up with management I was ignored until I threatened to call the city and have you reported  2) You don't assist anyone with printing needs. I have had to bring my own paper on numerous occasions and the staff was not \"more than happy to assist\" 3) Your shuttle service is terrible and you pointing out its hours of operation don't make it anymore convenient. Thank you though! 4) I shouldn't have to pay a premium charge to upgrade my wifi. You should provide wifi that allows me to load youtube videos in less than 4 hours. 5) Your office staff makes it absolutely impossible to get in touch with anyone who can control fines and overages. Over winter break when NONE of my roommates were living in the house for 2.5 weeks we were billed $30 each. It took five days to contact management and the overages were quickly dropped.\nIf you spent more time helping residents and less time sarcastically responding to honest reviews people wouldn't have issues living there.\n\nSincerely,\nResident of 1.5 years", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1499265009012, "text": "Thanks Alex, for leaving us this response. We regret that you had a negative experience with us, but are glad you brought this to our attention. In May, we did offer pizza to all residents that left a google review, either positive or negative, to get more feedback from our current residents. Our landscaping crew begins work no earlier than 8 AM once a week on Mondays. We are very proud of the fact that all of our cottages come equipped with helpful appliances such as washers, dryers, and dishwashers for no additional charge. We are sorry that you found our centrally-located trash compactor to be inconvenient, but it is located near our gates, making it easy to drop off your trash on your way out of the property. On your way to class, you may stop by our clubhouse to use our computer lab that offers free printing! Occasionally, we do run out of ink for the printer, but we are more than happy to assist your printing needs at the office front desk. Additionally, our community is located less than 2 miles from The University of Alabama, just a short drive away from the East Commuter Lot! We also offer a Crimson Ride shuttle for our residents that runs every 30 minutes Monday-Friday from 7 A.M. to 9 P.M and can be tracked on Transloc. Our wi-fi and cable package that we offer our residents, free of charge, are through AT&T U-Verse. I do apologize that you found your wi-fi to be unsatisfactory, however our cable package offers over 550 channels. AT&T would be happy to upgrade your channels if you would like to pay a premium charge. Alex, we are also very excited to announce all of the great clubhouse updates that are currently under renovation. Our pool will be closed for around 4 weeks, depending on weather, and we will hopefully have it back open by the 4th of July. We will have a renovated free weight room, cardio room, study room, and yoga room! We also offer a late-night shuttle that drops off on The Strip by Little Italy Thursday night from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M., Friday night from 10 P.M. to 3 A.M., and Saturday night from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M. If you are ever unhappy with your overages, you may contact Conservice to receive the exact bill from Tuscaloosa Water and Alabama Power. If you have problems with any fines you may receive or any any other concerns at all, please feel free to come to our office, open 7 days a week, to discuss this further.

It is close to campus, and a great price. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the maintenance men are relatively quick with response. They have great amenities like a pool, a tanning bed, a basketball court, a volleyball court, and a dog park.\n\nBecause it is associated with campus housing, dorm rules still apply. I live in low grade two bed room. Though it\u2019s not \u201cupgraded\u201d we just had a new air conditioning unit installed inside and out. They also updated the shower head and sink spout! There is a big variation in room size between my roommates and my room, but we made it work! There is not a ton of provided storage, but additive storage has been beneficial, and I HIGHLY suggest it if you move here and have a lot of stuff. Downside is that the walls are VERY thin and other students tend to talk until late into the night. Other than that, it hasn\u2019t been a bad experience!\n\nThe Grove is a fine place to live and worth the money, it can just be noisy. I would suggest this place to anyone not in a graduate program!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPic7jNDcrtBULsIUkr3W7bFuiUT2e2stOgCpEB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOr63Bz3mPTFwLypiXcAxY4pb_ic2LPzsDhjwBw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND9H9m-EC5cFMZE9_Bkh0DxJWVKx-ZFzBizyzL=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT8Bp6DfuWVs6jN7-SsW1WjI0mx1eFd-MyEfKM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-yB0ekpn_l3ggxx6MCcMjyTOFOZ4aE9Xlb7cD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6B1xBXsu_5DWx5oVjPLaF2LAwP02n7EObhTvC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDW7Pf62Yz-azTisPW0VrFgw7JlhJBiRBJ5IXd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiwryqn5-JThg9rNo8uxz6QBud7YW6So9jLq8m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr9V55oW9wlK0NVBkd8gCZyIl8kh9BGUS2rkCK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3Nmzf1x_Kh4-bDVgaQqkDgsO_kK5iJdONnzRh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdNEeMVpYyXEbb4CLMQhnxIFzNYDD7Oy5zWs3J=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLOsh-qlOL_T3tGvLKhQUZ0Og7o7-Cx77MTv2B=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-xRnfIYDQa8WFRqrUHqwhHXe2cDvoQv8Y6FHu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBoQJ7OCjFmEvY6VgIputT_5RnM-iOopkV4oSw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4E97p7mWw75A8oH0XUtmNI6XdhA4FQNutRYqQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1601647210724, "text": "Thank you, Bailey!

The management does nothing to deter the crime. They have a gate that has been broken for at least a year.

The cons are why my rating isn't a five star rating, but the staff at the office are the reason why my rating isn't a one star rating. One big con is that groundskeeping has been an issue as of late, and maintenance requests are very slow to be fulfilled. However, a massive pro is that the front office staff try to be as helpful as possible, especially Heather Burgess. Heather Burgess is one of if not the most dedicated members of the staff when it comes to serving the residents. She genuinely cares, and from my own personal experience, Heather has consistently gone above and beyond in order to address any grievance or solve any problem I may have had. Staffmembers like Heather Burgess are a huge reason for why I can't rate the Grove at a one star rating because they work incredibly hard to make living at the Grove a wonderful experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1542128421765, "text": "Thanks Kaleb for your feedback!

The rent is cheap for what you get but you can expect to pay more every summer because your power bill will be higher. They only allot $100 limit on your utility costs and it is easy to go over that in an Alabama summer. The Grove will try to convince you that it is cheaper to live at the Grove than on campus but this is not true. It all ends up being the same in the end.The crime is abnormally bad for such a place! The management does nothing to deter the crime. They have a gate that has been broken for at least a year. Vehicle break-ins are routine and every now and then you will get someone who gets a gun in their face. If you want to stay somewhere close to campus I suggest staying at Campus Quarters.

Perhaps when they start losing business they'll straighten up.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince posting this, the management of The Grove has contacted me about my experience. I was informed that the Grove was bought out from the owners that I had such a bad experience with and that it is now under new management. I was in contact with a phenomenal woman who has worked at the property for several years and is now in a position of management. It is always such a pleasure to work with genuine people who can empathize with others.\n\nBecause of the fact that she has gone far above and beyond anything than I ever expected, I'm giving the new organization a much better review and rating.\n\nThe way that my problem was resolved was both quick, courteous, and professional.

Nothing about the grove is appealing, you're better off living in your vehicle than living at the grove.  Its horribly unsafe.  I watched someone stabbed outside my window 2 weeks into living there, cops showed up 20min after i called them.  My neighbor was robbed at knife point and her car stolen.  One of my roommates had his car stolen the other was in our apartment when someone kicked the door in and robbed him at knife point and stole everything he had and anything i had in the living room.  They hit you with fake charges and force you to pay them.  The place is dirty, and loud at night and cops wont do a darn thing if you call them.

{"user_id": "111571956186502099770", "name": "Erika Schoemehl", "time": 1578602859643, "rating": 1.0, "text": "Living here has been the worst mistake so far of my college career. It is a total waste of money, I live in a four bedroom apartment, the complex makes over $2,400 a month off my apartment alone monthly. The price we are paying does not at all match the amenities or treatment. My roommates and my other friends that live here have had copious amounts of issues, and the staff in the office, all but managers and maintenance, are college students who are not equipped with the knowledge on how to properly run an apartment complex the size of OneTen. There is paint all over the floors of the apartment, the finish on our floor is coming up, the granite on our sink wasn\u2019t sealed, and none of the doors close properly, allowing air in which drives up the electric bill over the $25 monthly allowance per person. My roommate\u2019s bathtub is cracked and her bathroom sink faucet doesn\u2019t properly work and one of my bedroom windows lets water in when it rains (which is a lot in Mobile). You would expect a 100% pristine complex and rooms with the price we are paying. Recently, I was cleaning my apartment and decided to clean the vent that leads to my air filter for the HVAC system. Upon doing this, I took the cover off to clean it better. After I took this cover off, I discovered my filter had not been changed in at least nine months, but other people who have looked at it have estimated it had not been replaced in at least a year. OneTen currently uses VERY cheap monthly filters. These barely filter anything, and with them having to be changed monthly are setting themselves up for complete failure in this department. My whole HVAC unit is sopping wet and rusted, and the whole thing is most likely going to need to be replaced. It wasn\u2019t until after I went to the office and complained about this that I noticed maintenance actually doing their job and replacing filters. IF YOU LIVE AT 110 CHECK YOUR FILTER!!!! It\u2019s so simple to. I was diagnosed with a lung infection during the Fall semester, and this dirty air filter was the likely culprit. I am tempted to actually file a complaint with the Mobile Health Department. The trash compactor is also absolutely disgusting. There is trash covering the whole area around it, since the compactor was completely full. That is also a health hazard. I disposed of my very dirty air filter at the compactor, I had to put it on the ground outside since there was no where else to put it, and where I took the trash out the next day, it was gone. The ONLY piece of trash they cleaned up was my dirty air filter. I believe they did this so other tenants would not see it and check their own filter to see it\u2019s status, removing evidence, if you will. With the rent money 110 is banking each month off college students, they could hire an outside trash pick up company to come and pick up the trash that has accumulated. There is also trash, dirt, cigarette butts, and dog feces all through out the complex and the stairwells in the buildings. The balconies of most of the buildings are also disgusting. All of this breeds infestations of bugs, rodents, and bacteria. If you are a college student and thinking about living here, don\u2019t look at 110\u2019s Instagram account and think everything here is amazing and wonderful. Our rent money is wasted on other student organizations and incentives to move in here. Don\u2019t come here. Check out the other places, if I were doing this over again, I would rent in a non-student living complex. It\u2019s much cheaper. With how much money me and my three roommates are paying each month here (~$2,400) we could afford to rent a 4,000 square foot house in Mobile. Don\u2019t be a na\u00efve young college student and live here. Management will only take you seriously if you get your dad on the phone. It\u2019s not worth it.
