The interaction that you have detailed is very contrary to what our records indicate. While our technician did arrive late due to some issue with our equipment, he in fact communicated same.  At the time, you indicated that, that was in fact ok.\nWhenever we engage prospective customers whether over the phone or in person we always go over their expectations i.e. what they want cleaned and how they would like to see it look. We are then able to guide their expectations based on our own expertise. In your interaction with our technician, Martez, he indicated that your home was in fact badly oxidized and that with pressure washing it may become more evident in some parts than others. He further explained that oxidation is not caused by pressure washing  but in your case it was because of aging paint.  At the end of the service, you indicated that everything was in fact 5 star quality and you did leave a 5 star review to indicate such. It is therefore, quite unsettling that weeks later, you would call making such accusations about our professionalism and conduct thus purposely defaming our company.\nWith that said, we cannot stand responsibility for an issue for which our workman was not culpable.

First, you play phone tag with a person for a day then they want to come and measure each square foot of carpet to be cleaned which required me to drive 30 miles to the home,which in the end was a waste of time. Then because a 10 foot square area of carpet had some heavy staining this person proceeds to give me an at least $1000 estimate and several days away till job is done! I dont care what you do to a carpet you're not going to get all the stain down into the pad out I don't care what someone tells you,short of replacement. Charging attorney fee rates is ridiculous, you're cleaning carpet for 2 or 3 hours without going to law school for 6 to 8 years. In my opinion he just didn't want to do the job. Also wanted like $1.15 a sq. ft to clean tile with over 500 ft. to be done. Again, it ain't that difficult and those prices must be from New York or Cali.
