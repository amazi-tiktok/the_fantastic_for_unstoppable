Although I myself have had the blessing of good health, I have long been aware of Dr. Burns exceedingly fine reputation as a cardiologist. I have always known that if I should ever have an issue with my heart, he would be the only doctor I would trust to sort things out.  Recently, while flying a corporate jet trip in Asia, I needed to renew my FAA Medical.  During the appointment, some questions arose with my EKG.  I immediately contacted Dr. Burns and despite the 12 hour time difference he took my call and immediately began the process of understanding the situation and working to resolve it.  Despite not feeling ill, nor having any symptoms, I was told I would need an expanded cardiac evaluation right away in order to maintain my license to fly.  Within 48 hours I was on a flight from Hong Kong to Huntsville.  Dr. Burns worked me into his schedule, reviewed my FAA medical records from the preceding 7 years and performed a thorough evaluation to find out what might be going on with me.  Fortunately,  the tests revealed I am in good health but without Dr. Burns' help I would most likely have found myself out of my profession for months or even years, working through a very challenging system to return to work.  Instead, through his thoughtful and meticulous care, I was able to return to work with a clean bill of health and a freshly renewed Medical, a mere 5 days from the start of the entire adventure.   in addition to helping me to keep my profession and livelihood intact, Dr. Burns educated and redirected my thoughts on my health in a much more positive direction.

At the time of being referred to his office for my leg issues I weighed around 275 pounds and was not taking good care of myself at all. During the course of the treatments I learned I had turned myself into a Type 2 diabetic with a glucose level of 289 and an a1c of 13.1. I was put on Metformin as a starting treatment, with the ominous prospect of giving myself insulin injections if my condition didn't improve.\n\nI don't know about you folks, but I don't like needles. I made a total lifestyle change; I placed myself on a 1200-calorie, low-sugar (under 25 grams a day), low-carb (under 100 grams a day) diet, got back into a regular workout regimen, and did what my medical staff recommended. The condition of my legs improved vastly from the laser treatments. Three months after I began taking Metformin my prescription was cut from two tablets a day to one, and after six months I no longer needed it. Monitoring my sugar three times daily my glucose averages dropped to below 100 with an a1c in the mid-fives. My weight bottomed out at 198. You can either have a pity party for yourself and keep doing all the wrong things, or you can make the changes you need and improve yourself. It can be done; I'm the proof.\n\nI thank Dr. Naidu and his staff both past and present for all their help in getting me to this point in my health. I am 48 years old and in my best shape since my twenties. I eat heathier than I ever have, work out 4 to 5 times a week, and sleep better. My blood pressure is excellent and all my levels are where they need to be. I'm happy with where I am, and yet I still feel I haven't peaked yet.\n\nI would recommend Dr. Ajit Naidu and Cardiovascular Institute of the Shoals to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4861dc3aa17f:0xfebb8275f75040ca"}

I went to the heart urgent care clinic hoping to receive help because I had severe chest and arm pain on Wednesday and I was still having some chest discomfort. The receptionist and the woman who took my initial vitals and a EKG were very kind. However my experience with the nurse practitioner Tracy was less desirable. Tracy asked where I lived and I told her. She suggested I may want to find a closer physician to where I lived. That should have been my first sign to RUN !  Then I spoke to Tracy about my current issues that she quickly dismissed as being associated with my heart despite the fact that my ekg that was done at the beginning of my visit was abnormal. Tracy said everyone has abnormal Ekg\u2019s. Tracy never seemed to truly listen to my problems and she was dismissive of everything I said. I felt like my voice and my concerns were not heard. So, I asked what was wrong with me. Tracy initially said she wasn\u2019t sure but she knew it wasn\u2019t my heart and suggested I do stretches. Tracy said she was going to look at the results of my blood work that was done initially and come back to speak with me. Problem is , Tracy never came back. Tracy sent the poor receptionist to speak with me and give me my results and to tell me that I needed to schedule to come back for a stress test later this month but I didn\u2019t need to be in a hurry to do it.  The receptionist had a boot on her foot and was barely walking herself. I asked the receptionist to ask Tracy what did she suggest about my chest discomfort. The poor receptionist had to walk again and find Tracy. At this point, Tracy did not come directly back to speak with me. I ended up walking out of the patient room and into the waiting area to patiently wait to speak with the receptionist  once she got off the phone. At this point, Tracy came out in the waiting area to speak with me. I asked Tracy about my continued chest discomfort. Tracy told me that I could have pulled a muscle and I needed to take ibuprofen with every meal. Tracy then said it could be my esophagus or  just from standing up.

I know they are busy but you hate to go to the hospital to find out if she is in trouble. This Heart center has people that run a heart Cardiogram every time we go in so why can't they have a room set up for people that just need to make sure they are ok if they feel they are having problem? Most people would rather have a Doctor visit bill as apposed to a hospital bill just to get a Cardiogram run.

Therefore their profit margin is much more important than patient care and treatment.  Some of their policies reflect that also. For instance, if you go to the ER needing surgery, if there is not a DR. to do that surgery on duty, you will have to wait until one is scheduled if it \"probably\" won't kill you to wait.  My husband waited 3 days for an orthopedic surgeon for a spiral break in his femur, which is a very dangerous bone to break. It's where our blood supply is made and when broken, releases air bubbles and clots into the blood stream so he was kept on blood thinners for 3 days before major surgery.  Now, not only did the hospital get to charge us for those 3 extra days and all his normal medications, because you are NOT allowed to take your own from home, but they did NOT have to pay a surgeon overtime or vacation pay to come in when off duty, so we are cash cows to that hospital.  The nurses are horribly underpaid and badly treated, but with Huntsville Hosp. owning all hospitals for 8 counties, they really don't have a lot of choices. Most of the nurses were wonderful, however the Dr.'s, especially Dr. Wright, made us feel like our health was secondary to profit, pushing hard for procedures we are very hesitant about and offering no real evidence they would even help. In fact he told us straight out that it probably would not help, but it just might.  Just be aware the Dr.'s are Huntsville Hospitals life blood money and do your research, ask lots of questions, ask about safety and recalls for any hardware they want to implant. In our case the Defibrillator manufacturer was being sued in a class action suit because the leads were corroding and impaling the arteries, but they were still using these defibs and when we asked about them Dr. Wright's answer was, and I quote \"they all have problems\". Now that's not exactly comforting.  We told him we wanted to do some research and think about it, but that did not stop his office from calling us EVERYDAY for 3 weeks until I asked them not to call us ever again, we would call them if we changed our minds. Then we were told it was their job to \"recruit 12 to 18 surgeries PER DAY\".  Yes after 35 years of marriage, it is an \"us\" decision.  We both feel very uncomfortable with it all. We are going for a second opinion at Vanderbilt. I'll update and post what they tell us.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621354836d54b3:0xc3a7a40a6be15cbb"}

I am sure that the doctors there are great at their job.  I think Mother has had ok care.\nAfter several calls and no return calls back, we have managed to get the job done.  My Mother was in the hospital in January and ended up on a ventilator, the day she was released from the hospital the heart center was to come down and review her medication.  Never showed, but we had an appointment with her Doctor in a week so thought all would be good, but that appointment was changed, and then changed again.  Yesterday she went into see the dr and he had no idea what meds she was taking and what milligrams, are you kidding me, your nurse practitioner never showed up to review medications.  She is on coreg which needs to be taken two times a day, but the orders said one.  They changed her meds to hydralazine along with the coreg, the hydralazine is to be taken three times a day, but again the orders said once a day. Yesterday they took her blood pressure in the office and said it was 120/70, and my sister said that is strange. It has been running high, and she snapped back well not today.  Then the dr took it and it was 200/94, really.  On the way home from work last night my sister stopped to pick up meds and only one was there, a water pill, not the increased dosage of coreg or hydralazine.  Either this office is very incompetent or they have way to many patience.  Our Mother is very precious to us, and she has been through hell and back.

After my current pediatrician, Dr. Rivas, advised it was time to transition to an adult provider. During the time he was my provider, Dr. Ginevan worked alongside my psychiatrist to continue maintenance of my ADHD and when necessary, he worked with specialists to manage my delicate GI condition. This included references to appropriate clinics and scheduling of applicable tests ie. Colonoscopy, EGD, etc. I truly trusted Dr. Ginevan and was incredibly grateful to have found such a wonderful physician. I never minded the fact that his office was always moving locations or that his appointments had become a nightmare to secure. I still referred only my closest of friends and family to see him. Always assuring them they'd be nothing less than satisfied with him as they're provider. Those were the old days... in 2013 I moved away to live on base with my then husband. I moved back in 2015 and returned to Dr. Ginevan. He and his staff had undergone a complete restructuring as they were now a part of the mega-merger trend and had merged with the tri-cities health giant Shoals Primary Care LLC. Due to the merger Dr. Ginevan no longer had any of my previous medical records from all of my time spent under his care which led to massive complications to my continuity of care. (I now understand the importance of my responsibility to secure medical history documentation and maintain my own current updated personal medical record.) Also, SADLY, due to the implementation of a governmental-esque standard of operating procedures, it is my opinion that Dr. Ginevan no longer maintained the level of patient care he had became known for. His office staff has always been grade-A; to be commended. If you are considering seeing Dr. Ginevan as your primary care provider this review is for you. In closing I want to say that this review in no way, intends to slander or cause malice. This review is my personal experiential reference/opinions of Dr. Ginevan meant solely for the purpose of socially informing fellow peers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

I ignored that fact and still decided to give the doctor the benefit of the doubt because I could understand things sometimes happen. However, upon my scheduled visit as a first time patient it was for 7:30 am, and I arrived at 7:15 am for new patient paper work. I signed in and no one even showed up at the front desk until my appointment time, where I  then asked for my paper work and filled it out. About ten minutes after that, another woman called me by the wrong name and when I corrected her, I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong. Also, you can not hear when you are being called because the TV is loud, so people are talking over the TV, and I have two ear infections. After filling out my paper work, I was then called back to the window, where I was asked to write down my SSN, but I had already written it down twice on the form already. This told me they obviously were not paying attention to the information they were entering. After this, and already feeling on edge from just the front desk experience, I am called back by the doctor's nurse practitioner who tells me to step on the scale, and with a horrible tone says, \"you're going to have to take some of that off.\" Meaning my purse. I ask where I should put it in case of a designated area, which seem to make her even more annoyed and she replies with, \"I don't know.\" Very snappy. I am a new patient and felt like I was asking a very simple and non offensive question. We then walk to the exam room where she informs me that I would not be seeing the doctor and that he also would never been doing my exams or ever seeing me other than a quick peek in the room. Which, as someone looking for a long term doctor, it does not feel comfortable not even meeting my doctor on the first visit. When I tried to explain that I was uncomfortable with the fact she would only be relaying my issues to the doctor, and that I didn't feel comfortable having my health looked after in third person, and that I didnt understand why they wouldn't tell a new patient to begin with when making an appointment that he or she won't be seeing a doctor. She then got upset about it and told me I could reschedule or abort because she had been doing this for 40 years. Which is fine and I explained to her I was fine with her seeing me, but that I didn't feel comfortable having a doctor diagnose me without speaking with me and knowing me as a person. She gets more upset and I said I think it would be best just to cancel because at that point, being someone who has been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, I was overwhelmed and ready to go home. She proceeded to then say to me, \"Fine then. Adios.\" I feel as if the entire situation was unprofessional on many different levels. I decided to keep searching for a new doctor. I would not advise this practice if you want to get to know your doctor for long term use, or have anxiety issues, seeing as how it is the only doctor's office I have ever been in where the lobby is loud and over packed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

They called me a few days before my procedure and told me they were going to call me in a Rx to take before my subscription. They never called it in and now I'm waiting for them to call it in.

He recommended Birmingham Heart Clinic- 100 Pilot Medical Center Drive and made an appointment for me. On first impressions I showed up on time and paid by copay and sat down.. I was about 15 minutes early so as with most Doctors I expected a wait.  Well within a few minutes they called me back.  Very impressed that they would actually keep on time with my appointment.. After screening the Doctor wanted to do a stress test and a few more test on my heart and leg veins since I had also had blood clots.. I agreed to these procedures and have no problem with that service.  After the test the Nurse said the Doctor would call in a few days with the results.  Well after two weeks I contacted the Doctors office several time and finally received a call back that everything was good that the Doctor had been on vacation.\nIn a few months I heard from the Doctor\u2019s office again wanting to schedule an endovenous vein treatment procedure and they had cleared it finally with my insurance company.  This is really when the problem started:  The first treatment was scheduled for August 28 and at the time of scheduling I asked several times throughout the phone call what my out of pocket cost would be.. I was told by the lady and I hate I did not get her name that the procedure was being covered completely by my insurance that I would not have to pay anything.. $0.00!!! Well I went more into that with her she said it was \u201cpreventive\u201d so I would not have any cost involved.  WELL that\u2019s where I should have got that statement in writing.. Cause that was totally a LIE!\nAfter having two procedures with really no noticeable results.. But I was optimistic that that would help with my legs..\nEverything good until I called in December and was planning on making a payment only to find out the bill was upward $3,200.00.. We I was not prepared for that.. I told Lexi the lady in billing this story.  She said she would call me back the next day which should have been December 16th.. I finally got a call December 18th that she was working on this and would contact me back on Monday with her finding..\nChristmas came and went; New Year\u2019s come and went\u2026 Finally January 28th I received a call (voice message at work) that she had been trying to reach me.. Yeah right!   In which I called her right back.  She proceeded to tell me that no one there would say such a thing that they did not know what my insurance would pay or not pay.. Keep in mind for two months the Doctor\u2019s office kept submitting to my insurance company request to do the surgery and was the one who received the approval from the insurance company.. I asked who set up the surgery in the first place but of course Lexi said they have not record of that..  YEAH RIGHT!  She proceeded to tell me I would have to pay the $3,216.37. I have asked for copies of my complete file and all bills related to me.\nPOINT IS!  THINK long and hard and get in writing if you ever us Birmingham Heart and Vein Center cause what they say is not what they do!\nI am totally convinced this is how they make their extra money by saying one thing and doing another.  Lexi even had the nerve to tell me I would be charged late fees for not paying.. Think I will send Lexi a late bill myself since it only took her 42 days to get back in touch with me about this bill.\nI am hear by disputing these charges of $2,741.10 and any past due expense added to my bill!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890e766c126cf9:0xed7938bc8f97c6ac"}

Instead he said I had anxiety because I'm young when i have never experienced anything like this before. While at the ER i used a bed pan because they wouldn't even wheel me.. yet I felt Dr. Katta tried to make me feel like this was all in my head when tests at the ER say otherwise.  he won't tell me anything is wrong, and was about to send me home without one question concerning my symptom check list or test. His ASSISTANT suggested a heart monitor and even he gave a bit of an \" I'm sorry\" look. Dr. Katta's attitude was like fine. Since it was mentioned. Aweful. Would have sent me home without asking about my symptoms or doing one test. I don't even trust him to read my results or care just because I'm younger when cleary something is wrong. I had multiple \"yes'\" checked on the symptom chart from Siezure to chest pain, numbess to all sorts of more severe things and he didn't have one question for me. I will be cancelling my heart monitor with him and seeing someome that will make me feel cared for. Or who will at least not talk over me, rush and try to send me home.

The truth of the matter is that I, the Administrator for Huntsville Cardiovascular Clinic, had a heart attack in our office 9 days ago. I will forever be grateful for how completely and swiftly my staff and Physicians took care of me. My point in telling you this is to bring to light the fact that our Physicians are often handling VERY delicate life-saving situations that cause them to run late for clinic or just have a hard time fitting everything that must be done into a day.\nI am not happy to hear that you felt as if we didn't care that you left. I can personally guarantee that is not the case. We have a reputation in our community of going above and beyond for our patients. One might even say we even spoil them a little. Since Dr. Strickland personally reached out to you (and even gave you his cell phone number), I would hope that you now agree.\nI also hope that our actions since your first visit have given you reason to change your 1-star rating. Our success depends on your happiness and we are very aware of that fact.\nIn the future, please let me know if you are dissatisfied with any service you've received from us. I am more than happy to help!\nRebecca Hedrick / Practice Administrator / 256-945-0598"}, "gmap_id": "0x8862133bcbbf61ad:0x59261efeb07d49b8"}

Last November we moved my brother to Huntsville from Orlando and immediately requested that he be accepted as a patient there as well.  He has lived these last 7 years with a defibrillator in his chest but has had no regular contact with a cardiologist.  So far he's had several visits to the clinic to establish a file of his current cardiac condition.  One of those visits (3/16/17) determined that his defibrillator battery had to be replaced, so an appointment was set up for 3/24/17 at Crestwood Hospital.  That date had to be rescheduled to 4/6/17 at 9AM.  We showed up at 8:40AM only to be told that the doctor was stuck by weather in Minnesota.  No phone call preventing us from making the trip to the hospital!  The procedure was rescheduled for 4/10/17 at 10AM. We showed up at 9:40AM and began our wait.  My brother was taken back soon after arrival and prepped for his procedure but his waiting room tracking code never appeared on the monitor.  I began to ask questions around noon without success.  No one could tell us what was going on.  The doctor finally showed up around 4PM and my brother, who'd had nothing to eat all day finally made it home at 8PM.  Not one phone call from anyone!!!
