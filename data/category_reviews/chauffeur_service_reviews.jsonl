They told him they would be there in no more than 45 minutes. 1 hour later, no word. He calls them back, they say they took another job and would get him as soon as they finished. 3 HOURS LATER, my husband is still stranded and calls them for the third time. They end up telling him he may be better off calling another company. God forbid what would have happened or how long my husband would have waited if leaving it up to them to follow up on a service they accepted to begin with. Y'all are clearly in the wrong business, and people can be seriously hurt or have personal things in their life that an be SEVERELY affected by your negligence and lack of consideration.

Thanks Dennis Morgan..\n\nIn August I returned with the same auto after someone else worked on it. They did the fine tuning for $25.50.  I should have used them for the complete repair instead of wasting alot of money and time?

I provided the part. I picked it up Monday. I could not leave because the battery was dead. Never had that problem before. RED FLAG.\n\nThe mechanic there said something ridiculous to me about all the car batteries in their lot going dead since the hailstorm, or something to that effect. I guess I'm a stupid woman and would just accept that ludicrous statement as truth. RED FLAG. He jumped me off quickly, and left me there with my hood up. ANOTHER RED FLAG.\n\nThen we figure it out. My boyfriend noticed my brake lights were not going off. There were pieces of one of my brake light stopper in my floorboard. The other stopper is just missing. These are the parts that keep your brake lights off until you hit the brake.\n\nSo now my brake lights were draining my battery. I had no issues with my brakes or battery when I left it with them. The truck obviously had made it to their lot after the repair, but then the battery died. Any person with half a brain can see what happened here.\n\nI contacted the owner, who defended his techs, but offered to \"fix\" this problem IF IT REALLY HAPPENED. Unfortunately I do not trust this shop to touch my vehicle at this point. I have not even driven it enough to know if the crank shaft pulley was installed correctly because I am waiting on brake stoppers from Nissan.\n\nHe seemed angry that I would question his \"integrity\"... WELL WHY WOULDN'T I?\n\nSo $113 later, my two cents: Save yourself the hassle. I was married to a mechanic for 24 years... and some of them do this to women who they assume will not know any better, so they will bring their vehicle back to be \"fixed\".... It's not surprising to me that these guys have a \"Ladies Day\" ... I bet they get a lot of repeat business. I did notice among all their suspicious 5 star reviews the few who did have a complaint were also women. Maybe they assume we need a man to TALK to a mechanic.

I live about an hour and a half away so I really love it!  I did all my negotiating via email and set up a test drive appointment. Very, very, easy sale for the company. My biggest disappointment is the fact that the car was filthy when I arrived and the battery terminals were severely corroded. I am convinced nobody from the service department even looked under the hood until I made them.  I wanted the terminals cleaned,  I wanted an oil change,  all fluids topped off and a cabin air filter change (Very minimal requests for a car dealership) I stated it would have to be detailed inside. The detail department worked on it but they would only be there until 12 or 12:30. So we concluded our business (paid cash) and I went to lunch without the car.  Well by the time I got back the headliner was much cleaner but it smelled terribly in the car (like stagnant mop water). Nothing else was even wiped down and unfortunately the detail department was gone. There was sticky crusted disgusting something in all the buttons so some would stick in certain positions. Literally the battery terminal was only brushed with a wire brush to knock off the corrosion. I don't think the oil was changed. When I got home the oil did not appear new. I think they put new on top of the old then they mixed together. The cabin air filter was not changed. I removed it to check because everytime I used recirculated air instead of fresh it smelled bad. It has a new one now and it no longer has an odor.\n\nMy salesman was okay, but seriously the easiest commission ever. Wish I would have at least gotten an after the sale phone call. Just to check in. Would have made me feel better about the other issues.\n\nMy complaints are only directed to the service and detail departments.\n\nI am now looking for a truck in the $20,000 range (same as my Maxima) and I am not even looking at this company now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb264d8d2482b:0xf6be7f6160faedaf"}

My salesman was actually a nice  man, so i have absolutely nothing bad to say about him.  After going through this ridiculous process of trying to prove my income for 2-3 hours and trying to be put in a car  the finance company wanted me to have. I was exhausted, over it and ready to leave. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, someone decided to make a big deal out of nothing. My children went ahead of me and went to the door. They were holding the door for each other and then was holding it for me, waiting for me to catch up and come out. Before I got to the door they were approached by a lady. She told my children to either go out the door or go find their moma or daddy and they they were letting the air out. I was appalled!! I asked her what was the problem. I asked her name and she mumbled something and I asked her again and she told me she didn\u2019t owe me an explanation!!  Come to find out she was the owner. The salesman walked up to me try to find out what was going on. She began to butt in, so then the gentleman walked me out the door to discuss it. it started to rain, he offered to grab an umbrella for me. We make our way into the building and the owner runs up to the salesman and tells him he is her employee and He better not walk me out the door. How pathetic and nasty can a human be over nothing!!\nI\u2019m sick of people  acting ignorant for no reason towards me. So needless to say I left all deals on the table and vowed to make it known that I would never spend a dime with a company that doesn\u2019t value my business or dollar. So it\u2019s above me now!!\n\nAnd so far from what I hear the cars are junk! A friend of mine bought a van and the alternator went out 2 days after she purchased it.\n\nOh and if you plan on buying a car using your business name don\u2019t waste your time.

The salesman kept trying to put me in 2015 or 2016 vehicle and that wasn't what I wanted. The salesman was real pushy and not at all patient. I left from there with a 2016 Camry, the same one he threw in my face as the 1st car I drove even though I told him I hated those Camry. In the end he wound up giving me a car i absolutely hate. He made sure he got a good commission off of me, in spite of what I told him I like and wanted. I will take my other family members to another car lot instead of this one. So now I'm going to go to my father, God mother, God sisters, sisters, and lil brother and God daddy, who are all ministers, and plead with God to reverse this curse that was done to me and make a way out of no way to get the car I want.

The fact that some key parts needed are unavailable for this particular vehicle is no fault of his or ourselves or speak to the skill and talent of our technician, nor the honesty of our business. 4) After we communicated to your son we could not source parts needed, we agreed to remove the parts we had already installed and did not charge his any labor for this authorized work.\n\nWe are disappointed to find a review not based on your own experience with us a customer.  Negative reviews with no merit harm our business and our hard-working employees and their families.

TAPCO kept my car for over a week while making no attempts to contact and update me on the repair details. I had to call them daily. They did not give me an estimate for the repair and I was stuck with a $200 bill after paying them $300 the week prior. I went in for a new belt and to look at an oil leak and $500 later and my oil light is still on. Also they misgendered me (transman) the entire transaction. Very cool. Also your car will be sitting outside unlocked after they have worked on it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1623959183961, "text": "Cale, I apologize that you felt mistreated. You brought the vehicle in for the oil leak and we found your axle seal to be leaking. This is on the transmission side of your vehicle. The seal was replaced and you also requested a new drive belt which we happily installed for you. I advised you that there may be further oil leaks, and we would need to keep an eye on it and to bring it back in if oil was still visibly leaking on the ground. You had the vehicle towed in for a no start issue. After 3 hours of diagnosis not charged to you, we found that there was an ECM update needed for the vehicle. This is not a service we provide, and I know the advisor informed you that we were waiting on the programmer to come and flash the ECM. The advisor should of given you a rough estimate of cost for this service and I apologize he did not. We also did not know what the cost would be for the service because it has ranged from $45.00 to $400 in the past. So as we knew the fix, the cost was out of our hands. Once the programmer arrived, he performed the flash on the ECM, the vehicle cranked, and he gave me a bill for $200. We called you, let you know the vehicle was repaired and the cost was $200. We literally did not make one dime off of you, and spent 3 hours of diagnosing to confirm we had the right fix for you ( Normally a $345 cost). If your oil light is still on, then you may have another oil leak on the engine side and would need to address that issue, just as I advised you personally. As far as misgendering, we apologize, not really sure what else to say. We will do better with that situation as a whole. We apologize again for the way you feel. We were just doing our best to get your vehicle back in your hands, at the cheapest cost possible. We are not magicians, nor fortune tellers. We do not control when a vehicle breaks, or what mechanical part may fail and start leaking. All we do is advise the best path forward with as much information as we have to give the customer the best chance to make the right decision for themselves. Thank you for business. Please let us know if we can further assist you with your cars in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb89a66390d:0xc218ac2ba8793b57"}

I normally work on my car myself, but am willing to pay others to do so when problems are above my experience. I asked them to fix whatever it was that made the check engine light be on, which I knew was something with the vacuum system. I also asked them to fix two windows that weren\u2019t working. They \u201cfixed\u201d my car and gave it back to me. Well on my drive home, I discovered a rat chewed halfway through my seat belt and left dropping in the floorboard that they did not clean up. The next day I let them know when I got off work and they said to bring it in and they would fix it. And they did, but they replaced my seatbelt with a black one and my interior is grey. When they replaced my window regulators, they left metal chips from drilling all in my carpet and leather interior, so they did not do a clean job and did not clean up after themselves. ALSO, my check engine light came back on and was running the same codes as it was before I brought it to them. So then I had to leave it with them for several more days. They had my car for over one week. One last thing is that my driver window was tight before they serviced it and made no road noise. Now, it leaks air over fifty and I don\u2019t want to have to bring the car back to them for a third time. That same door now makes an awful rattling noise when it shuts, which it also did not do before they touched my car. I have had pleasant experiences with them in the past, and I left reviews those times as well but service was not what it use to be this visit.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608237580748, "text": "Arthur,\nSorry to hear about your displeasure with our work. Lets start from the top. The vehicle was brought in after you personally attempted to repair many issues with the vehicle yourself and admitted that you may have done something wrong as everything you had done has still not fixed it and the same check engine lights remain on and the vehicle was running rough, even after you worked on it personally. We used our extensive diagnostic equipment and found multiple leaks throughout your vehicles intake system. I personally called and told you we had found these leaks and would need to take off the intake manifold you just put on yourself to see what was going on under it, as that is where the main leak was. I also notified you that there was an code in your ecu for the EGR system and that it may be triggered by the massive intake leak and we would need to correct the major leak first, and let you drive the vehicle to see if there was still an issue with the EGR system. The EGR Valve was also covered with epoxy from what looked to be a band aid repair from a previous time. This could be an issue, but during the diagnosis we did check each component of the system and did confirm the actuators and the valves were operating as they should.  Once we had your approval for the work, we moved forward. Once the intake manifold was removed, we found that you had left the old intake gaskets on the engine and also used the new gaskets of the intake manifold you just replaced. This is what we call being \"double gasketed\" and quickly saw this was the issue with the massive intake leak. We purchased new intake gaskets since the new ones you installed were severely damaged. We removed the old gaskets and cleaned the surface to ensure proper sealing on installation. Everything went together very smooth on the install and a quick smoke test found that the leak was no longer and the issue was repaired. The codes were cleared and the vehicle was test driven and confirmed that the vehicle was running properly and no longer had any further codes in the system. You were called and told the good news and were made aware that the EGR valve was still in question but would need significant miles put on it to be addressed. Once you took the vehicle and drove it, the light came back on and when you brought it back in we found that the same EGR code was back and found that the EGR Valve that you epoxied was blocking the air passage and triggering the light. You were not charged any further diagnosis and we repaired the EGR valve and there was no further issue.\n\nAfter these issues were handled you requested that we look at your windows. The window regulators were found to be the issue at hand and they are riveted in from the factory and are very difficult to perfect. We Use OEM ford rivets and installed them to perfection with the factory holes in the door that were not modified in any way shape or form. I do apologize there is wind noise with the window now, we would be glad to take care of this issue and resolve it for you at no cost.  I was also not aware of the pieces in the floor that were claimed to be left by us, and I sincerely apologize for the possible mess left behind. I would be glad to provide a complimentary vacuum of your interior from a detail shop of your choosing. There was a good bit of mess on the floor, including crumbs and such, so we may of overlooked what mess we made, versus what mess was there before we began our work.\n\nThe seatbelt issue. We have never had a rat issue before at this location. We have been here for 8 years and never once faced an issue of the sort. We have biweekly pest control services done and stay very proactive with pest control due to the known issues of old downtown buildings and sewer systems. When brought to our concern, we replaced your belt with an OEM Ford part and purchased it by your VIN number at no cost. The interior in your vehicle was sun faded and that is why there is a color difference."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb89a66390d:0xc218ac2ba8793b57"}

They charged my daughter $100 to tell her that her check engine light meant her gas cap was loose. If they'll take advantage of a 19 y/o girl who's out of state, what else do you think they'll do? Seriously: $100 to read a check engine light code and (literally) tighten a gas cap. #epicfail", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608235243266, "text": "Kevin, I believe you may not fully understand the process of diagnosis on a vehicle. We take pride in our diagnosis and ensure the diagnosis is correct before we tell a customer any type of estimate. Our standard diagnostic rate is $100 and we roll that fee into the repair if you decided to do the repair with us. We have signage throughout the main office with this verbiage and discuss the process with customers as they drop a vehicle off. But yes, lets walk through it so you and everyone can understand. First, we read that check engine light on the vehicle, and used the $6500.00 computer scanner to do so. We went through and found every lasting detail on the issue down to the date it happened and how often it happened. That is where Autozone stops. They get their $30 scan tool out and tell you 10 guesses of items it could be. So now that we have a lot of data, and approved $100 of diagnostic work on the vehicle ( up to 1 hour of diagnosis ) we can move forward and start using our years of training and knowledge to properly diagnose your vehicle. Now my technician gets out his smoke machine (a $1600 tool)  that pressurizes your daughters Evap Emissions system and also fills the system with smoke so we can determine if there is a leak on the system. Then we put the vehicle on our $4500 lift to ensure that we inspect every inch of the system that has a fault. We also use the scanner in the above mentioned process to activate all of the solenoids of the evap system to ensure they are working properly and letting the system properly work. So now that we have used our multi thousand dollars in tools and years of knowledge that is priceless, we have determined your daughters system is actually in perfectly working condition and the only fault is that a personal mistake happened of someone leaving the gas cap loose! Whew! Seems like quite a lot for such a simple task, right?  Well what if you went by the local auto parts store, got a free scan on the vehicle and they sold you an evap canister for your daughters vehicle and then you take it somewhere for an install and spend $1000.00 and the same problem remains. I am sure this review would look a lot different if you took into consideration the time, the effort, the knowledge, and the care that was put into your 19 year olds daughter vehicle to ensure we did not sell her any parts or service she did not need and made sure she was getting the most honest and best value possible when she put her trust in our shop. I apologize you feel like we took advantage of her. I hope that you see we spent a careful amount of time ensuring we had a proper diagnosis, and realize that doing so does not come free. This business is how we feed our families and have done so for 8 years. If we did not charge customers for diagnosis, then we would become a charity, and likely go out of business, and your daughter would be stuck down the street at the dishonest shop that sold her thousands in repair work that was not needed. I am certainly glad to hear your daughters vehicle is still doing well and the check engine light has not come back on after our thorough diagnosis, with out costing her any extra money.  If you would like to further discuss this issue you are welcome to call me, Michael Lee, the owner whenever you would like to. I would be glad to walk you through our process and make sure you fully understand the extent of work we did ensuring your daughters vehicle was safe and properly diagnosed and why the $100.00 was charged. Most would consider it an #epicsave , you know, since we were the honest shop that did not take advantage of her and took every possible step to make sure her vehicle was diagnosed properly.

We were charged a higher rate due having to shop out of our home county (no CarMax in our immediate area) and the county where we shopped has a significantly higher rate than our home county.  We were informed they had to collect the higher amount but we could take a paper they provided, have our local tag office fill out the amount for our local office, bring it back in, and they would refund the overage.  That is understandable and reasonable and we appreciated the paperwork being provided.\n\nAfter going to the local tag office I made the drive back over to drop off the paperwork and I thought would receive the overage that day.  I was informed it would have to be processed by the central office but would be handled within approximately 10 business days.  Thirty days after dropping the paperwork off to them I had heard nothing so I called the local office and was informed it should have already been processed, they were sorry, and they would have someone call me within a day or two.  Two business days later I called again and was informed the process could take around 3 MONTHS.\n\nI am currently waiting to hear from the Central Office in Virginia to find out how long they intend to keep the overage.  The site we used did quite well for us in finding the car we were looking for and handling all the paperwork for a cash sale.

They will insist on you using their financing which means you'll get another hit on your credit.

Both minor issues, but in the light of the experience add to the frustration. They list the vehicle as a Toyota Tacoma SR5. At the time I wasn't aware of how to tell the subtle differences between an SR and an SR5...now I do and I feel a bit cheated. I don't understand how that mistake can happen. I noticed it when I put my Vin to register with Toyota. I have the window sticker right here.....Secondly, they did a real bate and switch on me with the financing. I needed the truck for work and decided to try and work with he other finance company directly after the purchase. And Finally they didn't issue me a temporary tag, but some 3 day pass. This shouldn't have been a problem, but they didn't get me my paperwork to register the vehicle for 11 days. I got pulled over and was issued a ticket. The ticket will be thrown out but it is still a hassle to bring my registration to court to prove I did it and take the time out of my day to do it. Very unprofessional from start to finish.

Unfortunately, she is wasn\u2019t the same person to help us with purchasing the vehicle. For that we were assigned someone else.\nShe seemed to work a little slower than the other salespeople, but it wasn\u2019t too bad. It was only a little frustrating because I didn\u2019t expect it to take two hours. Before we showed up for the test drive appointment, I already had as much as I could completed online, the loan was already prepped through another bank, and I even had the insurance quote ready.\nThen the very next day we were having some issues with the radio. I called, scheduled an appointment, and proceeded to wait another 1.5 hours after my appointment time for my car to be taken out of the parking lot to get looked at. After about 15 minutes, they agreed that there was an issue and said that they would have to call me back to schedule the installation after they order and receive a new radio. It\u2019s been 10 days. No one called. I found a work around for the issue and am not interested in calling them again. I\u2019m honestly worried that they could mess it up more and don\u2019t want to risk it. I can\u2019t say that I trust their service.\n\nThen the bank called almost two weeks after purchasing the car. They told us that had been trying to get a hold of carmax, but that they\u2019ve been ignoring them. They called and faxed them on two occasions. I\u2019m sure they emailed as well, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. They called us because they were in need of the paperwork to process the loan and asked us to try and contact carmax ourselves. I was a little frustrated then because I assumed that the initial purchasing process took that long because the girl wanted to make sure it was done properly. Now I\u2019m left wondering what exactly she was doing the whole time. My husband called carmax, and I can\u2019t exactly state what was said,  but they assured us that they would take care of it. Then the bank called again a FEW DAYS after we called carmax to let us know that they finally got a hold of them and are hopeful to receive the paperwork within the next 24-48 hours..\n\nIn theory, the carmax car buying process should be super smooth and simple.

This all happens before I could even drive my car off the lot. I waited 7 days to get my car. About a week later I open the trunk and realize there is primer and over spray everywhere, as you can see in the pictures. This could have been prevented by simply taping it up prior to painting. I called and left a message for the manager two days ago but still haven't received a call back. I've decided I will just take care of the problem on my own. If they can't take the time to tape it up and do a proper job i would rather them not work on my car. Very disappointed that this is how they fixed the damage they caused.

The car came in and was available for me to test drive and I was able to go back and look at the car and test drive again as much as I wanted until I made my final decision. They held the car in my name for a week while I decided. All of the employees at Carmax are friendly and helpful and provide you with any information they have about the car you are interested in so that you feel confident in your purchase. Their 7 day money back no questions asked return policy and their 90 day limited warranty also gives the peace of mind a customer needs, knowing issues can be resolved if there are any. I loved my experience and highly recommend the Mobile, Alabama store as well as Bobby Roberts who was my customer specialist. In my opinion, CarMax knows how to treat customers and understands the value in up front pricing without shady tactics like other dealerships use.  It\u2019s the right way to do business.

If you want to feel like a valued customer and not be treated like a thief and have your integrity attacked, I strongly advise you t spend your money elsewhere. There are plenty of other car washes in Tuscaloosa. If this is the last car wash left on earth i think its best to never wash your car again than to deal with these people.  Let me explain...\n\nI purchased the daily unlimited plan from Overflow during summer 2020. I dont really wash my car so often but with the pandemic i did not want to keep using my card in the machine or dealing with workers. A staff member came out and put a sticker in my car. He did not do a very good job at placing the sticker and it was not flush on the windscreen. I did not think this was a big deal since if it was then i would think the employee would replace it with a new sticker there and then.\n\nFast forward a few weeks later and thats when pestering from the Overflow workers began. One specific female worker kept accusing me of removing the sticker from my car. I tried to explain that the sticker has never touched since the day it was put on and she refused to believe me. I told her to change the sticker to a proper one, but she didnt.\n\nRecently, in the last days of September 2020, a new person started pestering me and that gentleman told me he was the owner.  He told me that \"5000\" vehicles have stickers from his company and none looks like mine so i must have taken it off to give my friends. Basically, he was questioning my integrity and accusing me of being a thief. I am a PhD student and instructor at UA, and so as an upcoming researcher integrity is super important to me and i got annoyed with the constant questioning of my integrity. I have never been accused of stealing anything in my life so i was very upset over this. I would never compromise my integrity, especially in the way they are accusing me.\n\nThe owner now told me that he could finally change the sticker or give me a refund and cancel my membership; I told him to change the sticker. When he came out with a new sticker he told me that if the new sticker starts to look crumpled after he puts it on then that means i am tampering with it and he would cancel my plan instantly. This then sounds to me like a set up. Clearly he still believes that i am tampering with the sticker and is setting me up to prove him right if the sticker looks misaligned in some way in the future. Anything can happen in the future; a pet or some object could come in contact with the sticker and make it misaligned in the future, and while that probability is very low it is non-zero. I did not want to give these people any opportunity to disparage my integrity further so thats when i told the owner i changed my mind and told him to give me a refund. He went to do it like it was nothing, like i was never a valued customer in the first place. Like i was begging this company for their services and not paying my hard earned money for it. No-one has ever touched that sticker, so their accusations and lack of reconciliation is sad.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a9233a5dece9:0x92f3e345a128e8c6"}
