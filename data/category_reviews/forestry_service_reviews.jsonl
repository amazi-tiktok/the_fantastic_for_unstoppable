We bought a house with a forest in the back yard and l reach out to him explaining in May my situation. I have custody of 3 small kids between 4 and 7 and am disable. I begged him to come and clean the back yard so we can put up a fence and l can have the kids playing safely in the back yard for the summer, so l dnt have to keep them locked up inside. I respectfully ask him to understand my situation and to tell me if he could not so l can find some one else. He seemed to understand and he promise to be there no later than 10 days.\n15 days pass by and we reach out to him and ask again. No answer. A week later he txt one morning he would be here before 9 am and we were so happy. Only to have him txt back in half hour that the department of transportation needed him so he dropped us with no other explanations. Same thing a week later. We will be there rain or shine before 8 am, his txt read. 9 am he texted.....it is raining so if l come nd get stuck is on your clock. WOW, for a guy that advertises on his web site that he works through water......was kind of an excuse to try to get out of it. My husband txt him back that it is not us that drive his equipment so how can it be on our clock? He got pissy nd cancelled the appointment. At that point we search for another company, Southern brush company, who listen to our grief with Mako nd felt so sorry for us that they send a guy the following Sunday am. He was so polite nd show up at 9\n, telling us he did not want to make us enemies with the neighbors and come early am on a Sunday. What a difference between Mako\u2019s cocky attitude and the humble and respectful guy Southern Brush sent out. Mako could have simply said he was to busy nd had no way to get to us in the time we needed instead of being so deceitful  and disrespectful. I guess unless he gets a six figure job, he thinks he can just give people the end of the stick.\nAm actually happy now that l found Southern Brush cutting and dnt have to EVER ask Mako for his services and would not recommend him to any one l know. You can post even on their FB page a review as they have it open, unlike Mako. They know who they are and that they dnt do any customer wrong so they dnt have to hide behind a close to comments social media page.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a06f5049362f:0xef58e30ae2cbaf15"}
