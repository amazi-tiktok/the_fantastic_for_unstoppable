JAMES MARDIS REVIEW: Southern-Home Structural Specialists was employed to stabilize a rear corner of the foundation wall that had settled prior to the purchase of the home by Mr. Mardis. Shortly after Mr. Mardis did purchase & move into the home, he called and stated that we had damaged the drain line and causing water to enter into the basement through the wall. This could only be his assumption due to the fact that the drain line was buried and covered with soil and not visible to see the assumed damages. Once the soil was removed and the wall exposed, by a waterproofing contractor hired by Mr. Mardis, there were no visble damaged to the wall or drain line. However, there was a visble horizontal crack more than 10 feet in length within the wall which is consistent with soil shrinkage allowing a foundation wall to settle. The waterproofing contractor stated the foundation wall & the water drain lines were not damaged by our company and that the horizontal crack was the entry point of the water. After viewing the photographs, a local Structural Engineer stated that the crack within the wall was indeed an ongoing settlement problem and a entry point for water seepage into the  basement even prior to Mr. Mardis purchase of the home. He felt that the water seepage into the basement may have been a pre-existing condition prior to the home purchase and was not caused by the recent foundation wall repairs performed by this company.\nAgain , this company does regret that Mr. Mardis purchased a home with pre-existing water entry conditions, and feel that his assumed negative customer referral comments were not valid or truthful.\n\nGarland Caudle, Proprietor", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjWx-X6PzIJZQ3wTiliqShz5N4LpPHiPMsFsuW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891c0aec8297e9:0x6cc7560106d0b002"}

A worker actually came to the hospital while my husband sat with a family who was going through major family illness  to collect final payment . The work cost 20,000 and cost us at least another 3,000 to make our yard useable again. We sent a pictures via a certified letter expressing our disappointment and requesting some help in fixing the problems a phone call from the owner assuring us he wanted us to be satisfied customers, well he failed. Today after three months we have finally gotten the warranty transferred to the new home owners. This took a three hour drive on our part to see someone face to face. We were given promise after promise that we could handle this via mail. Pick a different company for your foundation work.

The issue was the floor area around one of my dining room corners was dipping downward. You can out assessed the issue and gave me a price to repair the issue.  You told me that my issue was repaired but it would take time to correct itself. Over what? 10 years? or close to it, the issue was never corrected or never corrected itself.  You are supposed to be the professional concerning foundations. All the work you did or what you had to do doesn't involve me. You did this, or that, MY ORIGINAL ISSUE WITH MY FLOORING STILL EXIST TODAY BUT WORST. Whatever you did under the house, has created another issue, meaning now there is a hump in another area of my flooring, which I pointed out to you. So, your text about it would take 7 working hrs under my house in April, 2017 to correct my original issue with my flooring, and the now hump in another area did and has not happened. I was here when your work team arrived and when then left. You told me while they were working under the house, you would be inside the house directing them and to make sure of leveling.  Well, you were not here to direct so none of that happened and nobody told me to call the office for anything. Attached, is where you try to blame the builder.  I hired you correct my original flooring issue well after the builder.  Your correction should have included ALL THE REPAIRS TO CORRECT my flooring issues whether it what the builder did or did not do RIGHT?  So, here we are 12 May 2017 with my original flooring issues still existing, sagging and humped flooring.

{"user_id": "111344322851879445762", "name": "William McNeese", "time": 1483071287156, "rating": 4.0, "text": "Don Kennedy and Sons just completed major structural repairs on a home in preparation for a home\u2019s appraisal and inspection for closing. The work involved Foundation Support Piers under brick footings to fix cracks in brick veneer and Stable Lift Piers with 2x8 girders in the crawlspace to fix sagging floors.\n\nTony was referred to me by my real estate agent and he was absolutely fantastic. Tony came right on time when he said he would be there and his communications were prompt and professional. It was a pleasure to work with Tony during the proposal phase and the work itself. He is technically knowledgeable and dependable. I highly recommend him! He is the reason I contracted with Don Kennedy & Sons.\n\nThe foundation support piers did exactly what they were supposed to do. The stair step cracks in the brick closed right up as we had hoped. There was a little more impact to the yard and soil than I had expected, but not a major issue.\n\nThe Stable Lift Piers and 2x8 girders also did their job. They are not as elaborate of a solution as the adjustable \u201cSmart Jacks\u201d on top of poured concrete pads from AFS, but they do work and they are a little less expensive. I recommend that consumers understand what they are purchasing on major repairs like this and get someone to help if they don\u2019t. I did an internship with a home inspector, and I have structural improvements at my main residence, so I was able to spot some minor issues which Tony readily and proactively agreed to correct once I explained them on the phone. The laborers came right over, understood my concerns, and fixed them right away. Some additional materials were added at no expense/no questions. I think if Tony had been available to inspect before I did he would have corrected these on his own. My own inspection was prematurely hurried by the office manager \u2013 see below.\n\nAdministratively this business has some improvements to make. At 2:00 on Friday I was called by the administrative assistant that my work was complete and asking for immediate payment. I kindly asked for a chance to see the work first over the weekend and that I would pay on my way to work first thing Monday morning. I was told that they would have to ask the office mgr. This made sense and I agreed. Surprisingly, Jordan called me back promptly explaining that this was not acceptable per her manager and that I needed to leave my own job and arrange for payment with Jordan ASAP. I immediately left a voice mail for Tony. Thankfully he straightened it all out. I was never given an apology by the office manager.\n\nSo, I ran over first thing Saturday morning to inspect and observed the minor corrections needed to be made. The office mgr\u2019s insistence on paying right after they were done Friday seemed underhanded (and downright strange too), but Tony made it all right. The office manager needs to get better at being reasonable conducting business, treating people respectfully, and resolving business issues firsthand with customers. However, administrative assistant Jordan worked very hard to provide great, positive customer service. I remained with the laborers on Saturday to make sure everything was fixed to spec, and it was. The laborers worked hard and were very friendly.\n\nI\u2019d recommend to Don Kennedy and to their customers that a 7-10 business day payment period be part of the contract to allow the customer time to inspect repairs, Tony to inspect, and/or get a buddy to inspect after completion of the work. This will also take a lot of stress off the payment-hungry front office and the customer. I\u2019ve contracted lots of work over the years and I\u2019ve never been pressed for payment so urgently \u2013 despite a 50% down payment before starting the work.\n\nIn summary I do recommend Don Kennedy & Sons for residential structural repairs and especially if you work with Tony.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626a2e738087eb:0x38d226941a1e4b83"}
