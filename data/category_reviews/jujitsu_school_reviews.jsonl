Extra money for field trips, snacks, pizza parties, gas for the vans?!, etc.  Honestly, this is what changed our mind from doing the After School Program.  Also keep in mind the After School Program change: initially they said there would be homework time, Jiu Jitsu/tumbling/gymnastics practice, and an active game (we thought, perfect, not on devices!).  This has now changed to field trips again with daily fees and less emphasis on JJ, with no word of homework time.  It's basically 2-2.5 hours, why are multiple field trips expected???

I travel all over the country for work so I say this having had the opportunity to train at many well-known BJJ schools.

This teaching style makes it very easy to adapt the techniques discussed in class to different scenarios.  The class sizes are small so there is a lot of individualized instruction.

I joined Premier in October 2012 with Oct-Dec free. I enrolled on the family plan with my 3 children. My children quickly became bored with the short 30 minute classes that they could only attend twice a week. The instructors were good with the kids, it was just the rushed format that was bad. By January only one was left attending. I wasn't any happier with the jujitsu, Krav Maga, or Muay Thai classes. All classes were only 30 minutes as well. This means practically no warm up, rushed instruction, and little to no time to practice technique or spar. To make it worse, because I had some experience in jujitsu ( my main area of interest when I joined) I was handed a book with the curriculum for the night and left to teach students who had attended Premier longer than me on several occasions. So not only was I losing my training time, I was left in an awkward situation. At this point I figured I would just deal with it and not renew my contract when the 6 months were up. In January the owner sold me on joining the Certified Instructor Training Program with promises of additional training outside of normal class times, seminars that would be paid for by my tuition, weekly CIT meetings, and eventually running my own school under the premier name. There were about 4-5 other adults that signed up for this as well. We changed my contract to reflect that my monthly payments would now go to paying the $10,000 tuition for this course. Between signing up in January till April there were only a total of 3 CIT meetings, far from the weekly meetings I was promised. There was no additional training offered. The seminars were all held in either Kentucky or Texas so to attend you had to drive there and get a hotel. That's not so bad I suppose, but then I was told that there would be an additional fee of several hundred dollars to attend. Also I would have to buy all the equipment required for the seminars (which had to be Premier brand). To purchase all of this equipment added approximately $400 (that's with the CIT discount). By March I had come to accept I had been suckered into a joining a McDojo and was now stuck in a contract. I was going to make the most of it. A month or so later the lead instructor came to teach class intoxicated. To the point he was slurring and falling asleep mid sentence while sitting up. After attending the jujitsu class he taught, several of us informed the owner of the instructors condition. He allowed him to continue teaching the remaining classes (Krav Maga and Muay Thai) while he sat in the back and watched. After this I told the instructor that I wanted to cancel my contract. I expressed all of my concerns and disappointments. He assured me that he was going to improve everything and make good on his promises. He asked me to give him another chance and a little time to get things the way they should be. 2 months later the only thing that had changed was that he fired the instructor that was intoxicatedd. There were only 2 CITs left, including me. Everyone else quit showing up. I informed the owner via E-mail, multiple voicemails, and Facebook messenger that I was dropping out. I listed all of the reasons and was very polite. I received no response. I also contacted the billing company, Member Solutions, as per my contract, to cancel. I explained my multiple reasons for wanting to cancel, and they informed me that I could not cancel. The new contract I signed for the CIT program was counted as a loan for $10,000 that I had to pay back before I could cancel. I attempted again, multiple times, to contact the owner about this issue and once again received no response. I am fortunate enough to have a lawyer as a friend to help me beat this scam. However, I would strongly recommend you stay away from this \"school\".\n\nSincerely,\nChris Allen", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889720dd9ebefeb:0x8c472225533f0464"}
