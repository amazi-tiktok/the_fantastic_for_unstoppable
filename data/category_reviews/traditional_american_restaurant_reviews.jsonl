As a Manager myself, there\u2019s certain things I observe with customer service and the way customers are treated. Trina was very aware at all times of our needs and didn\u2019t fall short in catering to them. She was prompt, energetic, feisty and fun lol all while being professional! Would highly recommend to anyone looking to have a great time while visiting the area. Keep up the great work guys! Nice job Trina!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1614961283544, "text": "What a wonderful review! Nothing makes us happier than our guest having a wonderful experience!

We caught it right before they were closing for lunch. I honestly thought they wouldn't seat us so close to closing, but they did. STAR!\n\nThe ambiance is dark wood, open kitchen, and high ceilings. It smells amazing in there.\n\nWe chose a few appetizers because everything sounded so good, we couldn't decide. The fried tomatoes, okra & pimento cheese dish, and cheddar cheese grits (it's a side but were ordered it as an appetizer0 were amazing.\n\nI started with a cup of heirloom tomato bisque. Had the right amount of seasoning and not too much cream. Perfect. I had the fish & grits as my entree.

Staff wore masks and guests are required to wear them to enter, which was a must for us. They also had an outdoor dining area which made it perfect. Our server, Trina, was fun, knowledgeable and took great care of us. Cocktails were well done and priced well. We had chargrilled oysters for a starter. And they were served with homemade crackers! For entrees, we had the duck and beef short ribs. Both were really good, but the 5 onion and parmesan grits with the short ribs really made that dish a stand out.

Plenty of room for large groups or parties.\nCONS: Not good for kids with the cost of food & limited selection on menu that has unique meals. Its what I'd call fancy food. Not your basic hamburger/sandwich, steak & potato meals like most restaurants in town. Parking isn't great.  I think the handicapp parking is across the street & the other is timed metered parking.

First of all, the reservation experience was superb. Alyssa was awesome... great communication. The problem was the actual event. First, I paid for valet parking for the event because I knew it was going to be raining. However, a few people in our party had to park their own cars because the young men working valet did not know how to drive a stick. The next issue was the bar menu was not even close to what I had chosen and the prices were higher than the paperwork I was given. Our menu choices were salmon or peppercorn crusted ny strip. The salad was extremely small and had no cucumber. Some people had 1 half of 1 cherry tomato in theirs and some people had 3 or 4 halves. It was very inconsistent. All of the food was lukewarm, and the sides were anemic, almost non-existent. I heard several people comment they were going to get something else to eat on the way home. The steak, which was supposed to be peppercorn crusted, was barely even seasoned. At roughly $50 a plate after tax and fees I expected so much better. I was honestly a little embarrassed. The dessert was good, but the coffee had a burnt taste. The room was decorated nicely and the service was good.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e816f12d43cf1:0x92645b5dddf0e9c5"}

Then we walked in a gentleman opened the door and i was greeted by two you g girls who must have drank happy juice that morning because they we fantastic!!! Greeted me with a smile. I explained that i was late and greatly apologized...but they understood!! My boy friend is a pretty simple guy...pizza is his go to quick meal basically lol. So him walking into this restaurant made him shocked. (He didn't know i planned to come here lol). Any ways he wasn't so happy. We sat down and looked over the menu with Patrick as our waiter. I order some crab and my boyfriend the salmon, but after recieveing his order he didn't like it. (I tried it....and lived it...so i understand we have different taste buds) the manager brandy came over and did her best with his next order.... Some white fish with some fries as simple as it gets made with salt and pepper. He was worried that he might not like this one and she said she wouldn't charge him if he doesn't like it. I asked her to bring the sauce that comes with it even though he originally didn't want it. He tried it and said he didnt like it. She apologized and he informed her that he would still pay since he was amazed at how she handled his problem. I made him try the special sauce and then he was ECSTATIC!! He called her over and said he cant believe the difference! He cleaned his plate!!! I'm defiantly coming back!!! I've never dealt with such a fantastic staff before!!!

I rarely have a problem with service (to include here), but when I'm paying $30 for an entree, I want to know some creativity and skill has been put into it. I think Central accomplishes enough to warrant it, though - as always - not without a few faults.\n\nI like the idea of the snacks menu - a lighter portion than an appetizer. And the pickled vegetables were about as good as I was expecting, with a mason jar filled with green tomatoes, radishes, green beans, and asparagus. The brined worked into different vegetables with different degrees of effectiveness, resulting in some lightly-pickled green beans and some green tomatoes that were so sour and overpowering with juniper (or whatever spice tastes like a mouthful of potpourri) that I had to struggle to get it down.\n\nThe redfish I ordered was served without skin and cooked reasonably well. It was a drier fish, which put to good use the sauce and ragout with which it was served. Or \"ragout\", rather - I don't know if the disparate bits of corn, mushroom, and leek were tied together well enough to call it one cohesive item. The corn emulsion was a little better - a buttery corny sauce that did the job.\n\nThe open kitchen and the individual components of my meal were enough to make me wonder how they might treat that pork belly appetizer.

Beautiful decor. I came back with my husband later to price their event room. THAT wasn't the problem. The problem was when my husband and I were out on date night, we were originally headed to SAZAs around the corner, but saw Central first. So we checked it out. What an utter disappointment to be told there was no table in the dining room available for dinner. I looked around. 80% of the tables were empty. I told the host that. She said they are expecting a large reservation to show up and that we can use the bar, it's the same. My husband and I went to the bar. I was already feeling unwelcome and offended by the price. I'm sorry, but I think we were shoo'ed away to the bar. I understand reservations, but if you saw that situation, you would say the same. There's no way the whole dining room was reserved. Why...would you allow someone to hinder your regular guests with the party they are having quote on quote instead of requiring them reserve a room upstairs? I have never been so offended. I don't trust the integrity of this restaurant. This is what I told my husband. We left and went to SAZAs, it was the best decision! They were friendly, staffed, affordable, welcoming. It was our first time there too. Based on the customer service alone and food quality, we'll be at SAZAs again!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e816f12d43cf1:0x92645b5dddf0e9c5"}

First is the hamburger.  Apparently medium comes out well done.  I'm guessing they don't care because they smother so much Mayo and sweet sauce on it you can't taste much else.  I expect more from a high class restaurant with a $14 hamburger.  Second issue was my side dish.  I asked if I could substitute anything for the fries trying to be healthier.  I was told yes and given several options.  I chose a side salad.  What the waiter didn't tell me was it's an extra $3 for giving up my fries for a small bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little tomato and cucumber that probably cost them $0.30.  This is very frustrating trying to eat healthy on a budget.  To summarize, bad overly expensive salad + overcooked hamburger for $20= never again.

If that old adage is true then we should have left when we first arrived.  You show me a self proclaimed GOURMET restaurant with only two couples there on a Friday night at eight and I will show you a not so great place to grab dinner.  My son suggested Central and he loves fine dining.   Why shouldn't he, we have taken him all over the World.  He has eaten at Gargantua in Frankfort, Germany and Jules Verne and 58 Tour Eiffel both of which are on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.  The food was really not the problem some of it was actually good, however the service was terrible.  Our waitress seemed completely bored and disenchanted with us.   Yawning at us as she told us the specials.  We started out with the cheese, meat and fruit platter and she simply could not remember the names of the cheeses.  She was not going to present me with a lemon for my tea for love nor money.  I practically begged three times.  I tried to be as nice as possible .  My husband finally got my lemon from the bar.  I had to ask twice for a refill.  If I am paying $32,00 for a fish entree plus a dessert and appetizer then I deserve a refill.  Right?  The waitress then seemed to feel she deserved a larger tip than twenty two dollars which was ten percent.  The food:  My husband got the Rabbit.  It was delicious.  I had a taste and it was as good as any rabbit we had in Paris which was always delicious.  I had the Amberjack with Hoppin Joe and Crawfish Succatash.  The Hoppin Joe was delicious with the crawfish but the fish was a tad dry and a bit bland.  It was a very nice size of fish.  Kenny got the Bricken Chicken which he said was only average.  The Whiskey Collards were delicious as were the Fried Brussel Sprouts.  My  son got the Short Ribs which he seemed to enjoy.  The sides were delicious and seemed to be better than the entrees.

The place was just amazing from the moment you walk in; the staff were super friendly and attentive\n\nRight away it was a bit warm in there even for winter, they have a huge wood fired oven that many dishes are prepared in - albeit beautiful, it throws off a ton of heat\n\nWe started with baked oysters and the cornbread and sausage. I have to say, I didn't care for the oysters - and the cornbread was good, but not great, kind of dense and heavy. The sausage was good..but not remarkable\n\nThey boasted using local ingredients where possible - and especially from the gulf. I had the Fra Diavolo, which I was excited about because it was supposed to have Gulf Redfish, Scallops and Shrimp. It was good, but ultimately disappointing. The shrimp were very small...like almost salad shrimp and when they're cooked they become like hard rubber chew toys. The scallops were delicious - and I forgot there was even red fish in there until I saw some small flakes of it floating around in it. But the shrimp were the real crime here...missed an opportunity to showcase the wonderful gulf shrimp I had come to expect.\n\nMy friend had gotten the wood fired filet...which I had forgone in favor of wanting to sample the local Gulf offering. OMG - the filet was heavenly. Just delicious is was soft and buttery, it had a nice outer char with wonderful beef flavor and the smoky fire baked right in, and it made my eyes roll back in my head...so good! - So yea...I had some real food envy going on.\n\nI ate the scallops out of mine and was done with it. Central is a solid offering - I have a feeling I will be back in Montgomery again and I will be back to Central. Not everything was a hit - and it wasn't perfect but it was very good and I feel worth trying other things on the menu - this is a first class operation downtown and worth a visit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e816f12d43cf1:0x92645b5dddf0e9c5"}

We tried the oyster appetizers as well as the burnt end lettuce wraps.  Both were good but the oysters lacked any depth of taste besides the oysters themselves.\n\nFor the main course we had braised rabbit carbonara with peaches and some eggplant rollatinis.  The carbonara was unbelievably good...The peaches were raw in small pieces and really add a hint of sweetness.  The eggplant was good but spicy and not indicated on the menu as such.  Most items were $25 - $30 per plate, but the quality is very high.\n\nDessert list sounded like it was laid out by a 6 yr old as everything has cereal added to it, but don't let that scare you off.
