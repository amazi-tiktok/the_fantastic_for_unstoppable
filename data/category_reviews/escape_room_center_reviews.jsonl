Some friends and I went last weekend and found the key to our room in 15 minutes and were confused because we\u2019d barely opened any boxes. The guy working told us our room had been put back together wrong and items and clues were out of order and he didn\u2019t know why. He wasn\u2019t going to give us our money back or anything, we had to ask him if we could come back again the next week since it was a waste of time and money. He let us do that so that was the only good thing. We literally came back this weekend and our room was messed up AGAIN. We were missing clues and nothing made sense, we tried to call for clues/help multiple times and had to wait TWENTY minutes until after time ran out when the worker finally came back. So basically we spent 20 minutes looking for clues that werent there then we sat in our room for over 30 minutes just waiting on someone to come help us and let us out. It was absolutely ridiculous. We still never got our money back and we refused to come back again for another \u201ccorrect\u201d room. In addition to all of that, THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR ROOMS ON THE WEBSITE ARE NOT WHAT THE ROOM ARE ACTUALLY LIKE. we were disappointed because we chose both of our rooms based on the online description yet when we got in both rooms the storyline was COMPLETELY different. Super unprofessional, the workers hardly know the clues or how the rooms work themselves. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to anyone. One of my worst experiences and I will never go back.

That said, I felt like the rooms could have had a more cohesive narrative that drive you in the direction of a logical progression of solving the puzzles.

If there had been something that told us where to go and when I felt like it would have been a much better experience. We did finish but with not much time left. The magician's room was much the same way, there just wasn't anything to tell us where to begin or where to go or what to do and that made it very frustrating for us. You end up just looking at the materials that are provided and trying a bunch of numbers on a bunch of different locks which isn't very much fun. The puzzles were good but without any idea of what order to do them in it just made things kind of a frantic mess. We will definitely go again to try some of the other rooms and I know that the owner seems to read and reply to feedback so I hope I've given enough information.

Now as our guests go through the rooms we know that there are continuous tweaks that will need to be made in order to make the room amazing.  I thank you so much for the comments it does help to continue that lifecycle of the rooms.  I am not here to tell you that our rooms are the best around and will not change for anyone because that is just dumb. We take our guests seriously and want everyone to enjoy their time with us.  From the sounds of it, you guys have done quite a few rooms, if you have the time I would love to set up an appointment with you to discuss some of the more intricate parts of the games that you had issues with.  Send me an email at info@escapeenterprise.com and lets get together and talk escape stuff.

Throughout the game, I noticed we actually had to open the escape room door to ask if anyone was there to help us\u2014we had multiple hints. Even received extra with beverage purchases... the hint providing service was slow. Secondly, before the game started we were informed that the room had a tough lock to open where every group struggled... understandable... we received the hint to open the tough lock but failed to open so we called for assistance. Hilariously enough, even the game master struggled to open the lock... this whole process of opening one, tough lock took approximately 15 minutes\u20141/4 of our game time. With the intention of completing destroying the lock and my foot on the wall, I had to pull that one lock off with all my force after the game master left. But the game master assured that the time would get frozen\u2014cool.\nThirdly, when time was up... the game master does not hesitate to end the entire game by punching in the last code spoiling everything. There was not a single thought in the game master\u2019s mind to ask us whether we desired just a bit more time to crack the room... Game master simply walked in, punched the code, and we all stood there awkwardly, confused, & disappointed.\nWe complained about the lock... their response was there was prior information given before the game\u2014true. We recommended them to please replace it immediately\nWe asked if there was anything that could be done to remedy our dissatisfaction with the room and the fact we paid $200 for one hour to elapse so unfortunately. They informed us that it was up to the owner to perform refunds, but the manager informed us with a possible discount sent through our email. It\u2019s been a week... nothing. Obviously, their customer service skills need to be reevaluated.\nWas a real tragic end to a group\u2019s Friday night honestly.

The 1 min issue you mentioned is a feature where games are no longer bookable within 60 minutes of the start time--this protects us from someone booking the 4:00 room at 3:55 and we're not prepared--once that time has passed the room 'falls off' of the website.  As for you having trouble reaching someone we are rarely in the building during the week (unless a room is booked Wed or Thurs) and we're there answering calls during business hours Fri-Sun when it's busy.  Beyond that we check our voicemails X2 daily and respond to calls as quickly as possible.
