The doctors, anesthesiologists, and nurses were ready for her; there was no waiting. In the Surgery Waiting area for the families is a large screen telling the family when the patient is in the Operating Room, in Recovery, and Ready to go. Free coffee is set up there on a cart for the families waiting as well as a large TV. We were so well cared for that the time flew by.

In January 2020 I stayed in the psychiatric unit at brookwood hospital. I was abused by a staff member named Calvin. The charge nurse rowanda ordered me from my original room with a roommate to a small single bed room. It was there in front of two other staff members calvin threw me across the bed onto the floor on the other side of it. I told my psychiatrist Dr. Chili this had happened and I wanted to see a patient advocate. I also told other staff members this had happened one, a therapist who's name I can't recall. The therapist did exercise therapy where we used chairs for support. Eventually I was discharged escorted by security to my ride. Never having seen the patient advocate. I was in the hospital for 2 weeks before discharging. And was found competent to discharge at a court hearing. Thats the facts as I recall them. This abuse and neglect of Dr. Chili to allow me to speak a patient advocate left me scared for my wellbeing up until my discharge. It's taken this many months and moving many states away before I felt comfortable sharing what happened. Brookwood psychiatric has a bottom floor I have heard other staff members talking to each other refer to that floor as the dungeon or pit. Protect your loved ones and don't get psychiatric care there. Secret abuses happen, threats of bodily harm also happen followed by actual physical harm. Team brookwood seems to circle the wagons to cover it. This is my truth it happened to me.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfMBmSXA4OxttozG0Uxkb3wvK017rrMa_0pVxR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919a20c6888c9:0xdaee36c2be08793b"}
