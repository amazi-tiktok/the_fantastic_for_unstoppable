It is important to introduce new skills and concepts in a way that is best for the students to understand and grow their basic working knowledge.  At times, it is necessary to use unplugged activities to set each student up for success in these new coding concepts, especially in such a young group of engineers.\nAs for the subscription / final session:  We have been conducting after-school programs since the beginning of the school year for this particular school.  We charge a flat subscription fee no matter the number of weeks included in the month.  Some months had 5 sessions and some had 4 making it even out in the end.  Canceling the last session in the month was a worst case scenario for us.  We regret it was unavoidable due to mass sickness, leaving us with no teaching options.\nI believe in what we do and I'm so proud of how we do it!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888e81c389684d93:0x98e1599fff497dfc"}

Fast forward and he is on grade level and thriving!!  Mathnasium's unique approach combines a custom learning plan for every child with consistent evaluations and feedback, just the right amount of repetition to ensure mastery, and learning strategies that employ different teaching methods when one is not working.  My son now has excellent number sense, but more importantly, he BELIEVES he can learn math because he has experienced success.
