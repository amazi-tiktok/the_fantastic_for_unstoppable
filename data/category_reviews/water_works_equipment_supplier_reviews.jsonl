Crew is efficient at installing/servicing parts but ignorant of any business details like price estimates, options, schedule and unwilling to discuss water quality problems with the well.  Just part swappers it seems.  Owner is too busy, distracted, and uninterested to answer simple questions.  Flat rate $1800 pump install but they wont say what pump they plan to install.  Whatever happens to be on the truck that day.  Owner talked badly about other local well service and their products but never said anything good about her own.  When I called other local well services to locate the specific pump I needed for a solar application, they were all complimentary of Houston apparently due to a family connection.  Competitors did a better job selling her services than she did.  I think these are good people overstressed by their situation, but they still need to learn how to talk to customers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887eff9f11479ff7:0xa5b5670e7524910a"}

I called 5 well companies, hoping one could come out and look at the problem. We thought it was a simple pressure switch issue. Zondra texted us first thing in the morning, even though she was out of town, to touch base with us, find out if anyone else had been able to come out. Another company did come out, giving us the bad news that our well pump had broken off the spool. This company had no other idea, other than drill another well. We texted Zondra with the diagnosis, she told us she has a tool to \"fish\" the well pump out, she could be here Monday morning. They were promptly here at the time, they said they would. It took them just shy of an hour to get the pump out, replace the parts and get us up and running with water and the repair was reasonable too! Zondra Houston Well Services is second to none!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887eff9f11479ff7:0xa5b5670e7524910a"}
