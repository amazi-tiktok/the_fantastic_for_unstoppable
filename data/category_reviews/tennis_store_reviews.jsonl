Maybe the manufacturer did foul up the order but why did it take nearly 3 weeks to sort it out? When I asked for a loaner racquet for use during an upcoming match since mine was already 2 weeks overdue, I was told that I could pay a $5 demo fee to use a racquet. Really? I just spent $200 in your store and you can't loan me a racquet for 1 day without a fee? I got the distinct impression that \"we're the only tennis shop in town, you're stuck with us\".
