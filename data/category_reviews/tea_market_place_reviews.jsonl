I was given a gift card for Christmas, which was purchased mid-December, and didn\u2019t realize it had an expiration date. This wouldn\u2019t have been a problem, except the expiration date was April 1st, a mere four months after it was purchased. The problem isn\u2019t the expiration date itself, it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s not even six months out + we\u2019re in the middle of a global pandemic. It\u2019s not the easiest to get out and use gift cards at the moment. According to the store owner, the money \u201ccan\u2019t be held that long\u201d as it\u2019s \u201cunfair to others who sell in the store,\u201d despite the fact that the gift card was paid for, in cash, and should be treated as if it\u2019s cash.

The scents burn cleanly, with none of that funky, smoky \"incense\" smell (If you've ever burned the cheap stuff, you know what I'm talking about.). Smells Like Teen Spirit is my fave! It reminds me of my grandfather's cigars- warm vanilla and cherry.\n\nThe teas are good, too! Try the vanilla caramel rooibos herbal. So good, and it has a natural sweet taste.\n\nThe employees are also always super friendly and welcoming.
