Editing post to say my son Graduated a couple days ago and my daughter still has 2 years remaining. This school has the staff, character and sports that are top notch. Christian athletics is somewhat better than public in that it tries to leverage competition while maintaining a Christian attitude which is the burden of the league to enforce and direct in my opinion. The fans, kids and coaches may not always get it right but you do have accountability. I see one negative post below and find those accusations unbelievable. Pastor Cova takes exceptional care of the grounds and facility. I have never seen anything but care, love and compassion from him and all the staff.

The principal at that time Alan Cova was a true hypocrite, pretending to be a Christian while swinging out back to smoke cigarettes and cuss kids out. Once he threw a chip bag on the ground outside the classroom building. I can remember looking at him puzzled, then laughing and throwing down an orange peel. He gave me detention for an hour to pick up trash. Another time, I was sent to his office for talking in class. He decided 2 paddles licks was in order and one hit me across my lower back. I had a bruise for almost two weeks. Coach Thompson was told me to shut my \"goddamn mouth\" during a softball practice. I still remember him being right up in my face and his spittle flying everywhere.  Micki Jackson was another hypocritical nightmare of a \"teacher\" who egged kids on to pick on one another and chose favorites. She was loud and fat and thought herself a goddess. Lots of sexual misconduct and harassment was experienced. I know times and faculty have likely changed, but I still wouldnt recommend this school or church to anyone that has any integrity.

We loved the teachers and that class so much. One morning when he was in the guppy class I was dropping off my son and the lead teacher of sea turtles was opening that class. My son had a blow out so the teacher was changing him and I was standing there helping her. As I\u2019m talking to her she is taking his clothes off and then begins to use his outfit to wipe his stool off his entire body. His outfit ended up having to be thrown away because after three washes it was stained. I mentioned it to the admin and the director and nothing was done. Everything was great until he moved up to the sea turtle class. We did not want him moving up to that class because he was only about 7.5 months old. He wasn\u2019t even crawling, but was attempting to crawl. They kept pushing me to move him up even though I expressed my feelings towards it several times. They stated he was \u201ctoo big\u201d for the guppy class and he couldn\u2019t fit in the swings anymore. He was a 7.5 month old who couldn\u2019t even crawl, in a class full of 1 year olds who are walking. After he moved up to the sea turtle class we started having issues instantly. The lead teacher would tell me what to do and not to do with my son. He came home with three knots on his head over the period of time from when he moved up until this week. Nobody called me to inform me that he had hit his head either. When I picked him up the teachers or admin staff would state they didn\u2019t know how he got the knots and bruises on his head. Also, every day when I pick up my sons nose is crusted with snot. It clearly hadn\u2019t been whipped off all day. His clothes would be covered in the foods they had eaten that day too. Several times I would have to change his clothes and clean him up before leaving because he looked so bad. On many occasions he came home with 3 out of 4 bottles still filled with formula that I had pre made that morning. The teachers would state he refused to eat. Let me mention that my now 10 month old is 27 lbs, he doesn\u2019t miss a meal. When I would pack his bottles up to leave he would get so excited like he wanted one, so I would give him one and he would drink it so fast like he hadn\u2019t eaten all day because he hadn\u2019t. They only gave him one bottle for an entire 10 hours. When my son was close to 9 months old he came home for a week straight throwing up randomly and having bad stools. I finally took him to the doctor thinking he was sick. I came back to the daycare the following week and told his teacher that his doctor said he was fine. That is when I find out that his lead teacher had been giving him whole milk with his formula without asking me or even telling me for an entire week. What if my kid was allergic or I didn\u2019t want him to have milk? The doctor even recommends children not have whole milk till they are a year old. I expressed my feelings towards her stating all my concerns about it and she states in that class they train the children on whole milk. I told her not to give it to him anymore but I would find out from the other teachers that she continued to give it to him. One day I had to pick my son up during nap time for a doctors appt and she told me to shhh that I would wake the children up. Let me mention I was whispering asking how my son was that day. The same teacher has gotten a stern tone with two of the other kids in his class while I was in there talking to her during drop off, so it makes me wonder how she is talking to my son without me there. These are only a few things that have happened. The director was aware but never did anything about it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923c63d1e68f1:0x3f6222559ce30c38"}

Prior to enrollment, my pre-school son was being cared for by family members instead of a daycare. The decision to enter him into a regular kindergarten program was a big one for us, and after considering several options we chose HCA. Some positives for us as outsiders to the school were the smaller class sizes, education from a Christian worldview, AdvancedEd (formerly SACS) accreditation, location and opportunities to continue his education through high school if desired. The end of my child\u2019s second year is approaching, and all of us (including him) are pleased with our decision to select this school. My son has progressed so much over the last two years, and he is still excited about going to school every day. It is great to experience his teachers\u2019 dedication and love for him and his love for them. He regularly talks about school even after finishing for the day. As my son grows older, I look forward to him being able to take advantage of the sports programs, and increasing his participation in the fine arts offerings he is experiencing now. I feel confident he will continue to get an exceptional education at Heritage Christian Academy that will help him develop into a well-rounded individual.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f45ef61c76f:0xad7a04f43c9d9983"}

When I once asked what the difference was between our version of Christianity and others, like Catholicism for example, I was regarded with great suspicion and asked why I would want to know. That is a sure sign of a cult. During my senior year one of our worst teachers took over as principal and redirected the institution from any educational focus to almost purely one long religious pep rally. Time was shaved off of every class time to make room for a brainwashing session in the gym every day. Nearly every one I knew who went to this school was tremendously damaged by the whole experience. Some completely turned away from religion, others fled, and a few actually succumbed to the brainwashing and ended up sending their own children back into the fire. Take it from someone who escaped by the skin of their teeth; do NOT subject your children to this torturous environment.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f45ef61c76f:0xad7a04f43c9d9983"}
