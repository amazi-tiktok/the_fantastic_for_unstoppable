Let's be candid: endodontic care (root canals,etc) is very expensive ... no matter who you choose to provide it. So, why not make the most informed choice possible and pay for \"the best?\"  One must always bear in mind, especially when selecting health care professionals, that you are paying for \"alot\" of different things that come together during your procedure. They must have excellent training, extensive experience performing \"your particular procedure,\" the latest equipment and technology, qualified and well-trained assistants; and, a discernable commitment to what it is they are doing. There's another thing: the patient pays, not only for what the provider does ... we pay for the provider's vast wealth of knowledge (acquired at considerable expense) AND FOR WHAT THE PROVIDER KNOWS WHAT NOT TO DO.

I knew I was being treated by a true professional when he DID NOT recommend root canal therapy for that tooth, even though he could have, but instead recommended a simple filling. These are the kinds of things that set professionals apart from those trying to move patients through chairs. True patient care in all respects.
