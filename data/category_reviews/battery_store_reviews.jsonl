My goal was to take it to Florida and have it street legal. Although I knew I should buy from another dealer and probably in a Florida, the owner, Blake, assured me that he would make it legal and promised on at least 3 occasions that if it didn\u2019t pass inspection that he would take the cart back and refund all of my money. I knew I should have gone with my gut, but instead I tried to help the little guy out and go with the small business owner.\n\nI rented a trailer and drove two hours from Atlanta to pick up the cart. Although we had agreed Exactly what would be put on the cart, when I showed up only about half of the items were on the cart. I should have left then, but I had already put down a $1000 deposit for the work. An argument ensued with Blake and when he got there his workers started to put items on the golf cart. However, even though he told me he had them, all of the necessary items were not even in his possession. Many of the nuts and bolts had rust on them. It\u2019s obvious that he just piece meals things together. If you are spending $50 it\u2019s one thing, but when you are spending $5000 things should be right.  However , because I drove all that way  I elected to take the cart anyway and purchase the necessary missing items.\n\nWhen the final purchase was made, Blake also guranteed the golf cart would run for one year. Well, two weeks after purchasing the cart it started to have trouble. After not passing inspection in Florida, I called Blake and he somehow claimed amnesia about offfering to take the golf cart back- just as I had predicted. So, now I have a golf cart that doesn\u2019t run and I have to take to a reputable dealer to have it repaired.\n\nSo, if you are consider purchasing a cart from Infinity Golf Carts, go over every inch of the cart before you accept and pay for it. Blale is Not a man of his word, so make sure that Everything is in writing. Even then, if you have a problem do not expect him to be a man of his word.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb3b432a6556d:0xfeb121d6fbc9df14"}
