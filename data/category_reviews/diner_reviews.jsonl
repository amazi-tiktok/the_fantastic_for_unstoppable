The chicken has a strange after taste and tasted nothing like what you might expect it to taste like, and the Vegetable Roll was uneatable. Worst of all though was the Fried Rice. It was mushy, not at all fried and made to order and tasted like prepackaged rice.\n\nIf this place wants to become a great eating place it needs to wake up. COOK my food, don't reheat it. NOTHING is worse than Fried Rice that is just microwaved. Conversely, I LOVE fresh made rice and won't mind the wait.\n\nUntil they start actively making their food to order WHEN it is ordered I will not reccomend this place.

My daughter was playing in a softball tournament and we came in for lunch. We arrived at 11:10 and were the first ones there. We ordered our drinks before the rest of her friends arrived. There were about 20 altogether. She ordered cheese sticks and a large BBQ sandwich. I ordered the small hamburger steak. Julia and the table next to us got their cheese sticks at the same time but within a minute, the server was back at our table to check her marinara sauce. She said, \u201cit\u2019s not good\u201d and asked her if there was another sauce she would like. About 11:30, Julia got her sandwich as the rest of the food started coming out for the other tables. By 11:45, all of the people at the other tables had their food except one other person and myself. The mom at the table next to us told me that they found mold in their marinara which was why they took Julia\u2019s sauce back. It had an \u201cM\u201d on it, which I now assume meant Monday. At 11:50, I asked our server \u201cis my food almost ready because I have to leave in 5 minutes\u201d. She went to the back and asked, came back out and said they were waiting on the fries. 2 minutes later, she brought me my food and I asked her if she could put it in a to-go box. I got up and went to the register to pay and had to ask for a fork. I thought surely they would give us our drinks for free or something, but nothing was offered except an apology. I paid $22 for the food and as I was waiting for the fork, another server asked ours why she apologized. She said, \u201cbecause it took so long to get their food\u201d and the other server said, \u201cdon\u2019t...this is softball season and it is always like this\u201d. I am a business owner myself and I rarely ever post negative reviews because I understand how things can go wrong and how many things are out of your control...and had this server not said this standing right there in front of me, I would not have posted this. Also, the cook explained to the people at the table next to us that it takes a while because everything is cooked homemade when ordered. However, my hamburger steak was definitely a pre-formed patty. And finally, my fries were still mostly raw when I finally got the chance to try to eat them at the ballpark. Save your money. Buy a salad at Piggly Wiggly or eat from the concession stand if you are playing a tournament in Phil Campbell.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYLafm6HaAC5WV8MonIpO4PBvekL6nFrgor3e1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8887f064af11422d:0xc45992bedd8b4122"}

I'm glad cause if I had paid for them the level of disappointment would have been overwhelming. They are the low quality frozen onion rings that has the very thin supposedly sliced onion that has no onion flavor that's breaded in breading that has no flavor! I also ordered the crawfish that's boil-in-bag with potatoes,  sausage,  and corn. I imagine it would have tasted alright if I could have eaten it! There was so much grease in the bag and on the food I was afraid to try it! I don't know if the grease came from the cheap sausage that was included or if they added margarine thinking that would add flavor. The corn literally had to be rung out with paper towels before it was edible!\nAll-in-all the jewel in this experience was the waitress Ashanti! Her patience and her professionalism spoke volumes!

Very clean, attractive facility. They are famous for BIG cakes and other bakery good: pies, baklava, cookies and cheesecakes.\nNeat, friendly servers-everyone was observing the current requirements\nMenu: The menu offers fewer choices than I remember from previous visits; I suspect that is due to the current situation. I also remember (maybe incorrectly) that breakfast was served all day. That is no longer true.\nThe Food. Coffee was hot and good; servers were always ready with a refill,. Big plus: coffee is included with the price of breakfast! The toast and grits were good (any bread other than toast incurs an extra charge). My Western Omelette left a little to be desired (thus the degradation of rating to 4 stars).  It was a \"3-egg omelette\", but they must have been SMALL eggs.. The fillings (the normal Western Omelette ham, green peppers, onions) were good and tasty.  The extra $1+ charge to include cheese was not expected. Also, unexpected: the omelette was quite overcooked. No \"fluffy\" omelette here. It was not bad enough to return to the kitchen, but it was not a great experience, with dry, almost rubbery eggs. Definitely was not up to par with other City Cafe experiences (at their various locations). One plus: they put only strawberry and grape jellies on the table-you don't have to dig through a dozed \"mixed fruit\" packets to find the lone strawberry jam!\nI still recommend City Cafe Diner but with some minor reservations at this time.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaDXZGDUkjZsGAMmiZo_FQTefzC5CJeosxdKMw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1599842069458, "text": "Hi John thank you for your visit and your comments.

Very clean, attractive facility. They are famous for BIG cakes and other bakery good: pies, baklava, cookies and cheesecakes.\nNeat, friendly servers-everyone was observing the current requirements\nMenu: The menu offers fewer choices than I remember from previous visits; I suspect that is due to the current situation. I also remember (maybe incorrectly) that breakfast was served all day. That is no longer true.\nThe Food. Coffee was hot and good; servers were always ready with a refill,. Big plus: coffee is included with the price of breakfast! The toast and grits were good (any bread other than toast incurs an extra charge). My Western Omelette left a little to be desired (thus the degradation of rating to 4 stars).  It was a \"3-egg omelette\", but they must have been SMALL eggs.. The fillings (the normal Western Omelette ham, green peppers, onions) were good and tasty.  The extra $1+ charge to include cheese was not expected. Also, unexpected: the omelette was quite overcooked. No \"fluffy\" omelette here. It was not bad enough to return to the kitchen, but it was not a great experience, with dry, almost rubbery eggs. Definitely was not up to par with other City Cafe experiences (at their various locations). One plus: they put only strawberry and grape jellies on the table-you don't have to dig through a dozed \"mixed fruit\" packets to find the lone strawberry jam!\nI still recommend City Cafe Diner but with some minor reservations at this time.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaDXZGDUkjZsGAMmiZo_FQTefzC5CJeosxdKMw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1599842069458, "text": "Hi John thank you for your visit and your comments.

Portions are mega portions at this diner. My husband got a cheeseburger the size of a grapefruit! He was very happy with the taste. I had a western omelette and it was huge. However after reading the menu a second time if you like cheese with that you will have to order it. Since this restaurant also had Greek and Italian dishes I automatically thought there would be many seasonings to our food. However the appetizer which included fries, chicken fingers, and onion rings we're very bland in taste. That is the only issue I found with this restaurant. Maybe they too were made to order and being in a hurry we missed it on the menu (like no cheese for my omelet). I would highly recommend going to the City Cafe.

Their serving sizes are 'massive' and they 'always' fill the plate. One meal here always leads to at LEAST two meals, because there's just that much left over. Despite all of the food you get, the prices are still very reasonable, if not down right cheap! Yet the food never tastes cheap in the slightest, only delicious!\n\nIt is also I'd much note that they make and bake their own desserts.

Forgot one of our sides, bread instead of English muffin, whole egg instead of whites, etc.\n\nServer aside though, the food wasn't well cooked. Sunny side up eggs were significantly undercooked with still runny whites. Grits were undercooked. Egg-cheese sandwich was quite soggy... Home fries were just partially mashed potatoes, not consistently mashed and very plain...\n\nOverall just really bad, and we're really not picky. Surprising based on the good reviews here.

The menu is vast and offers several cuisines from sta dard American, Italian, Greek and more. We also had our two [picky] older grandchildren with us and a good variety of children's fare was on the menu. I ordered the Gyro, supposedly the largest of anywhere while my wife had the chili burger. Our daughter had the cherry waffle and our grandchildren had the kids Mickey pancakes and spaghetti for the other one. The food was bright quickly and was freshly made. The gyro I ordered was served as a pita wrap and had all it is supposed to have. The meat was tender and delicious and the tzatziki was freshly made. Each of us were beyond satisfied and full after our meal. I couldn't pass up desert from the 15 or more cakes at the counter. These were beautifully made and appeared to be freshly made as well. I decides to try a trio of different cakes for all of us to share and was not disappointed at all. From a raspberry white chocolate, coconut and strawberry shortcake, each bite was like a piece of heaven. Do NOT be taken back by the cost of be at $8 a slice! With 5 of us sharing the scrumptious cakes, we barely made a dent in them and brought home the leftovers. Overall, if you are looking for a classic, real diner with more menu choices than you could ask for along with amazing deserts, this is the place. Service is great, prices are incredible and the food is spectacular.
