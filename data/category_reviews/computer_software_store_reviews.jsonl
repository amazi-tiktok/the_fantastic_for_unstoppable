During our 10-year tenure there have been computer stores that have come and gone however we have survived, and the reason why we survived is because we do good work and most people obey the sign that is posted on the door.\n\nIf they come and we're not present they follow the instructions they simply pick up their cell phone dial the number listed and Presto a representative arrives within 15 minutes just as stated. You have been most unfair in your review, has it ever dawned on you that we are the only full service retail computer store that's in operation in Wetumpka also within a 20 to 30 mile radius? Shouldn't that alone tell you that we are busy and there will be times when we're not at the store?  You do know that we have a telephone number that most people call, even to make appointments.\n\nDid you pick up the phone and call us to inquire about where we are what we're doing? All of the previous years that we've service you, you've never taken the time to say anything good let alone take the time to leave a positive review.  But here it is after 10 years of service you choose to leave a 3 star review not in regard to our work or the quality of work,  but you leave a 3 star review all because you arrived and no one was at the location, and you failed to pick up the phone call call.\n\nWe service residental and business customers alike, and we provide house calls and onsite service to both. When a business calls us and states there main business computer is down, we setup an onsite service call leave the store even at times when no one will be left to service the store. Why do we do this?  Its not personal its just business.  There is more money to be made in one business service call then there is for us to sit in the store waiting on residential customers to find the time to bring there computer in.   For you to reply to our absence as thow we are out on lake martin fishing rather than taking care of business is certianly not fair judgment. The good book says \"Judge not lest you be judged, for the same measure in which you judge others, you will be judged\".\n\nMaybe the next time a solicitor comes to your residential door in an attempt to sell you a product and you're not home, maybe that's solicitor should log on to Google and leave you a negative review. Not based on the fact that you didn't buy his product, but a negative review based solely on the fact that you were not even home.\n\nIn closing, I would like for you to exercise your right to choose another store to do business with.  Best Buy would be the closest and is only 45 miles away from your residence.  I just can't see the logic in us continuing to service someone who has Judged us so unfairly. If you would like to discuss this matter further, our phone number has been the same now for 10 years. I hope you have a better day."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2694964e20c1:0x7e27f6a2f3473c19"}

No where has this picture ever been shared, sent, or even seen by another soul other than myself. That is until I took my phone to get the battery taken care of at CH PC Repair.\n\nNow I understand that this is partly my fault for leaving that picture on my phone, I accept that. I had honestly forgotten that it was on there. But I had incorrectly assumed that my personal data would remain personal while my phone was in Chad's possession, but apparently that isn't the case.\n\nWhile the battery was fixed, I've now got to live with the fact that there are not so tasteful pictures of my wife out there for the world to see thanks to some perv PC repairman. If you for some reason desire to use this child for any repair work, make sure your data is extra secure or you wipe your memory card/hard drive before you take it to him.

Everything is on his demands, but never his fault.  Respect is free, try giving it away sometime.\n\nDon't believe his stories.

But mistakes happen - all I needed was for him to say 'Sorry, my mistake'...

Fortunately I had not shipped the part yet, as I was going to be in the US shortly, and able to do a much quicker & more secure USPS shipment...  But once you threaten negative feedback over something that you're wrong about, and are repeatedly unable to understand that you're in the wrong - damn right I'm canceling that order.  I have the right to \"fire\" a customer who is not conducting themselves appropriately.\n\nMost notable is the fact that negative feedback was left for me, and it took ~5 minutes for the eBay rep to review the details and get it taken down.  His complaints to eBay have resulted in absolutely zero effect on my account.

Ordered a battery from Amazon and they couldn't get the back of the phone off.  So they call the Verizon retail store in hazel green and the girl told her to take it to ch pc repair and he would do it.  My mothers phone worked FINE when she took it in there.  She could do anything and everything on her phone.  When she went to pick it up the phone would not even turn on.   He said he tried both old and new battery and it still wouldn't come on.  So he took the screen off and put it on another phone and the screen works.  So he is saying that the mother board is messed up.  He can check it out BUT he'd have to charge her to do it.  Momma said he really messed the back up,  like it was melted!!  I met her up there and his attitude is  basically \"screw you \".  He insisted that the phone was not working when she took it in.  I asked him why he didn't call her and tell her and he said because she didnt leave a number.  To which my reply is \"when you work in customer service like this it is your responsibility to get a number so you can get in touch with the person\". He is a total jerk!!  He takes ZERO responsibility for his screw ups.  Said he was not going to make it right.  But he did tell her that he'd buy the phone from her when she bought a new one.  Then he threatened to call the cops on us \"because it was after hours, he was closed and we wouldn't leave\".  He never asked us to leave, period.  He brags about how much money he makes per year and all of his vehicles and house is paid for.  Good for him.  I dont give a \ud83d\udc01but what he has and doesn't have.

You came into my office, clearly disgruntled. You then continued to talk over me without giving me a chance to respond or explain the situation.\n\nPam visited my store with her device, which she believed to have a battery issue. She provided an aftermarket battery and had explained that an attempt was made, using a hairdryer, to open the casing and replace the battery, prior to me looking at the device. When the device was dropped off, I was in the middle of an extensive repair, as well as having a conversation with a different client. Not only that, but the device was dropped off quickly, without any contact information, and with very few details.\n\nI replaced the battery with the after-market battery she provided and then attempted to boot up the device, but to no avail. I investigated further but was unable to find a solution. Pam then arrived to pick up her device, and she was, understandably, very upset to find it not working. She wanted it in working order right then and there, and while I understand her sentiments, I can only do so much so quickly. I needed more time to troubleshoot and determine the problem and possible solution, but she would not allow it. I was even willing to reimburse her with a fair value for her device.\n\nI have been in business for more than 10 years now. I work hard every day, and I like to think that I am very good at what I do. I manage hundreds of computers monthly, and I repair and fix many devices daily (thousands of devices yearly). I can remove a device's back/screen in a few minutes with simply a bit of heat and some playing cards, and I have never had any issues. I would never damage a device intentionally. I treat all repairs as if they were my own. That being said, mistakes can (and do) happen as there are many risks involved with these repairs, but I do my best to make things right. To me, it's not just about collecting payment for the services I provide\u2014although that is necessary for me to stay in business and provide for my family. It's about building long-term relationships with my clients, and I deeply enjoy helping and providing knowledge to my clients.\n\nThis is the first complaint I have received with the BBB, and I would truly like to resolve the issue, and have the opportunity to change your outlook on me and your experience with my business. CH PC Repair is my business\u2014it has my name in it, a fact that I am proud of and would never change.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Harbin\nCH PC Repair"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623f52db6fed93:0x398f7a17a9216be3"}
