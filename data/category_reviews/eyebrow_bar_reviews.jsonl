I know what a good short haircut is. Anyway, one day, was in a hurry and needed a cut on short order. Picked Unicuts on a whim, and now Kiran is my hairdresser. Very sweet and definitely knows how to cut short hair. She razor cuts, point cuts, texturizes it big time. And all for $20 + tip.

I politely tell her \u201cmy hair is very blonde, I don\u2019t want them too dark\u201d- she proceeds to continue mixing said dark dye and tints my WEDDING brows BLACK. I was disappointed but thought maybe it would fade some and start to look more presentable. However when I left & saw it in the light it was terrible (even after 15 min of scrubbing) so I immediately went back, they showed no remorse and had no fix for my black brows. Today when I woke up (brows still black) I also see that she burned my skin while waxing which is painful considering I am having to have my hair dresser re-color my brows to match my hair. In addition I paid ahead of time, yet the technician argued with me about paying for quite some time until awkwardly she agreed to let me leave.  Lastly, they had signs posted telling people to sanitize their hands and wear a mask, neither of which did the technician do. Overall a very poor experience. I hate it, because I do like to support local businesses. However, I would not recommend this shop to friends or family.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888910f59209dd45:0xb2e57b0ee96556b2"}

I got there at about 4:45 and when I came in there was a lot of people in the waiting area and also in chairs waiting there was one worker and I actually didn't see her when I first walked in so I was looking around and then she yelled at me asking what did I need and I told her \"I'm looking at the price list\" and she said again what do you need and I said \" lashes and eyebrows \" I looked for the price menu there wasn't a price for mink individual lashes so I asked her and she said there were different prices for everything so I asked again \" how mush are individual mink lashes\" she said 35 and I said ok ... also what made me go was because when I googled it there was an ad for free brows with any services ... so I waited for about an hour she said she will show me the two types of mink lashes that she has and I made my selection and sat back down .. she had me to sit in her chair then asked me if she can get the girl that came in after me and I said ok then she said she would do one of my eyes then do her brows and come back to me I said ok but then she told me she had a deal for $55 for eye brows and lashes that's when I told her about the ad and she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about .. them she said that the lashes will be $55 not $35 she. As I ally waited until all of the people that were there when she told me $35 were gone to change the price so that I can change my mind and get something easier because she was in a rush ! When I told her that she changed the prices she got loud with me and fussed at me as if I was lying on her when she was the one who told me 35 so I still was willing to get a services even though I was lied to but everything went left because she was rude I waited for over an hour for nothing and she still skipped over me and tried to brush something off in me so that she can hurry to get to church ! Like my time wasn't important !! Over an hour ! My 2 year old son and husband had to sit in the car the whole time and she locked the door and turned the open light off at about 5 when there was a sign on the door saying they would be open at until 7!!

The paper work that you signed at the beginning of your service, explains that if you are unsatisfied with your hair, your stylist will be more than happy to come up with an arrangement to get your hair where you would like it to be. We truly wish you would have come to us first so we could evaluate your hair and make it right for you without the additional costs of another salon. We have offered for you to come in and have us take a look at your hair to evaluate the situation, and we are sorry that you did not want to come in to work this out. Unfortunately, due to the time your stylist spent with you, product used, and not having the opportunity to evaluate your hair in person, we are unable to refund you for this service. Upon reviewing your paper work, your stylist noted that your hair would need more than one service to achieve the end results that you were wanting. This is due to the fact that your hair was already previously lightened at home before your visit to us. We are always striving for what's best for our clients. In this circumstance, your hair wouldn't be able to handle any further lightening in one visit. It is our understanding that in order to protect the integrity of your hair, you and your stylist decided to go with a darker blonde until your next service. We aren't quite sure what happened between the time you left the salon and now, but after your service you told us that you loved your hair and even booked your future reservation with us. We deeply value you as a customer of ours and we are sorry to see you go. We appreciate your review and we hope you have a wonderful day."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a61f96ea20655:0x14238b725edd250"}
