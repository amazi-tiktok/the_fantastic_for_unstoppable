The initial survey cost was triple the price of any of their competitors. They charged an additional $350 for a plot plan and to stake the house out.

We were told today that it costs $1300.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1527887412839, "text": "BL. Sorry you are unhappy with the cost to do this work.  Our records indicate you were quoted an estimate of $900 for a boundary survey and proposed plot plan. An additional $200 for a Certificate to subdivide.  Fees are paid by property owners for recording.  No quote was provided to stake the house.  These are three separate items and significantly more than just a \u201cpre-construction survey\u201d The work was way more involved than expected and as you are aware we discounted the invoice over $670 not charge more than the quoted amount plus recording fees.\n\nGetting the work done properly and accurately is more important than recovering our expenses. PWM never strives to be the least expensive and we never tell a client that we are.  What we do is provide a quality product that we will stand behind at a fair market value.\n\nBlake McAnally"}, "gmap_id": "0x8862867dd22ff17d:0x59df3097c9755b74"}
