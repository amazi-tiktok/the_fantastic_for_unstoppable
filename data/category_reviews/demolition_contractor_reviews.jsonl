I bought the house about 7 years ago and had no clue where the tank was but had a general idea.  Nick and crew came in, found the tank in 20-30 seconds, marked off approximately where it was, dug down to it and sure enough there it was, just as they'd suspected.  It was, in fact, the source of my problems in the house.  It was full of water.  They cleaned it out, resealed and covered it and i'm good for another 3 to 5 years.  Great job fellas and enjoyed chewing the cud with yall while being schooled on what my problem was and given options on how to address them going forward after this stop-gap measure.  Good stuff Beckham Septic.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926c3ac2569eaf:0xbcfcb3559147d68c"}
