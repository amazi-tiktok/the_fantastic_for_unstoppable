I've also explained to you directly that our pricing is a lower percentage for Pokemon than for Magic since the turnover is much lower than Magic. I realize you play both games and you're welcome to trade in Magic or Pokemon for store credit for anything, not just trading Pokemon for Pokemon. Our singles inventory should be right at Tcgplayer mid prices other than the cards under $1. Our base price for mtg rares and Mythics is $1 and commons is .25. Our Pokemon base price is .25 no matter rarity.  Our sealed products are generally based on Tcgplayer pricing as well. Our main card game is Magic the Gathering and we generally have approximately 100,000 mtg cards traded in per month. We continue to allow trade ins even though we are paying storage fees on somewhere between 2.5 and 3 million cards in the to be processed areas right now. I'm sorry you're disappointed in the service or offers you have received. We always give the customer the pricing and the choice to keep or sell their items. I know that this is not the case exactly with you, but you would be amazed if you knew how many people think if a card is $200 online that they can bring it and sell it to me for $200 cash. I work very hard to offer a fair trade in policy and all individual trade in pricing is based on the percentage given for the particular game and the quality of the card alone. Bulk collections have their own pricing schedules and I ask the players to sort out the expensive cards from the bulk to make sure they get the most money for their trade ins."}, "gmap_id": "0x88890b09fcf5a675:0xce64eacf9912dcea"}

We generally check both Amazon and Tcgplayer. Right now most Pokemon is selling for more than normal. We are having to pay more than retail for most products just to keep it in stock so people can have a place to purchase it. Our first run of Pokemon that comes direct is priced less than you can get the items direct from Pokemon for. The wholesale companies are charging more as well. We also limit quantities on most Pokemon items so everyone gets a chance to purchase. We keep Pokemon in stock that hasn't been in most retail stores for ten years. Out of print collectibles almost always sell for more than retail. We always have multiple Pokemon items at regular retail price. I also make sure to point those items out to customers when they come in. This is an issue with the limited printing from Pokemon. That's why it's sold out everywhere locally. We've also been cut on available quantities from the distributors. Out of 200 elite trainer boxes of Shining Fates ordered, we received only two and we sold them for $49.99 each release day. Checking with Walmart.com today 3-17-21, MOST products we have in stock are actually less than buying online from them. Example, Shining Fates ETBs are $130 on Walmart.com, they are $99.99 at our store. Evolutions booster packs are $31.99 each at Walmart.com, while ours are $17.99. Vivid Voltage booster boxes are $299.99, ours are $199.99. Crimson Invasion ETBs are $135.24 at Walmart while ours are $84.95. Champion's Path ETBS are $109.99, ours are $99.99. In looking up over 20 in stock products, the ONLY Pokemon item I  found less at Walmart.com was the Dubwool box which is $34.95 while ours is $34.99. Several products I found we are over 50% less than Walmart.com. Market value (also known as OMV, or \"open market valuation\") is the price an asset would fetch in the marketplace, or the value that the investment community gives to a particular equity or business. I think you were referring to MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price) or LIST price. MSRP will not generally apply for out of print or high demand collectibles in ANY industry. Same thing happened with the VW TDI a few years back when they were selling for $20,000 over MSRP and you had to put in your order three months in advance."}, "gmap_id": "0x88890b09fcf5a675:0xce64eacf9912dcea"}
