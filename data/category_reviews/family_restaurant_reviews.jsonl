That has its ups and downs.  Ups sit where you like, not where you are lead.  Down:  The server for that section may not know you are there.  After looking over the menu twice and discussing the options provided, roughly 10 mins; we got approached by the waitstaff for drinks.  The place was not very busy, but there were other folks there.  Got our order in. Eggplant Parm, the Italian, and order of cheese breadsticks.  It took a while for the chow to hit the table.  The Eggplant Parm was a big portion  looked really tasty.  The Italian  was wee for a 8-9 dollar sandwich, i would say less than 6 inches of it total.  The meat cuts were great though.  Cheese bread.... can't tell you just yet, as it has not arrived.  My side salad was fair.  The Greek dressing was really good.  However the onions were old as they had become translucent and the red had seeped into the meat of the veggie. My friend had to get up to get his tea refilled.  The waitress did not even acknowledge that she had not returned with his drink.  I scarfed up my sandwich after removing the onions.  Good, but not valued correctly in my opinion at the cost point.  When i had cleaned up my area, just a thing i do having been a server, my cheese breads arrived.  They came with an apology about a mix up in the kitchen. Things happen.  They were the best thing out of all that was ordered.\n\nWhat this place needs to do to stay alive in a market flooded with food options :\n*know that this place is new and are working on finding their rhythm\n\n1.  Bring on better wait staff, and add another the floor\n2.  Re-evaluate their price points on certain items.  There Special was a great deal!\n3.  Polish the time from order to table.\n\nI will be going back in a month or two to see how things have changed.  It has some great things going for it.

We have made some changes to our staff and changed the bread for the sandwich. It is a much better portion now. I hope you will try us again.

Service was horrible, took forever to get our drinks once seated after an hour wait, my first glass of wine had lipstick on rim of glass that wasn't mine, appetizers were brought out right before our main dish with salads and bread, steaks prepared wrong, mashed potatoes weren't completely done, no angel hair pasta (my absolute favorite item), and some items were never delivered... And it was not very busy by this time. Seemingly lazy, incompetent and unconcerned staff in regards to customer service and customer satisfaction. Manager was nice enough but somewhat nonchalant about the situation and I'm pretty sure I was not the first to discuss these issues with him last night and I think most of his staff should be dismissed and replaced with people who actually provide the type customer service expected when spending the amount of money we spend here every year.

Surely an Italian restaurant can't mess up Italian dishes. Hence my sarcasm.\n\nI wanted something quick, to-go. The venue was quite busy so I knew it'd be a little while before my order was ready. No problem. But after about 40 minutes I started getting a little antsy. I walked over to the VERY friendly young woman whom I had placed my order with. She advised it'd just be a few more minutes.\n\nShe was right, my food (I ordered the Pasta Linguine w/shrimp and scallops, and a Chicken Ceaser salad), was ready in those few minutes she mentioned. My order was totally screwed--the blame could be placed on me for not checking my food before I left, but that's not my job to know their job.\n\nMy chicken Ceaser salad didn't have any chicken. They had placed the chicken that was supposed to be on the salad on the linguine. And they also placed some vegetable soup with my order. I don't even like vegetable soup. The pasta was totally dry as well, it was supposed to have a tomato, creamy sauce but maybe mine disappeared, because it certainly wasn't anywhere to be found.\n\nI ended up at least trying to eat some of the pasta but it prematurely & intentionally went into the trash. The salad was fresh though.\n\nWith so many restaurant offerings it often hard to give a spot another shot, nothing different in this case.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a4d65451269:0x9fba3973b50c979f"}

So I ask him did they not put onions on the sandwiches anymore,  and he stated yes, so he grabbed a knife that had been hanging on the wall, so I thought he was going to clean it, it was already dirty, I said are you going to clean that, he stated to me, very nasty, its what I have used all day, I said, I don't care, don't use it on my food, he then he got mad and stated to the other employee who was standing there, finish this order and then I really wanted my money back, He stated he didn't want to fool with the register, so I ask for corporate number, and he stated I am corporate, I stated okay, but I am going to take this further than you, I took those sandwiches and fed them to my dog.

My spouse and associates ordered 12 oz ribeyes. I ordered a 8oz filet. All were cooked perfectly to our specifications. There was a steak topping/dressing/accompaniment that was not in the description; possibly it was sauteed mushroom pieces. possibly just grill remnants from previous food cooked. There was not a pile of it, but it was on all four steaks that came to our table. It did not bother me or associates and had no overwhelming flavors but my spouse scraped it off because of an aversion to mushrooms, onions, and anything else that could be misunderstood. I chose aspaeagus and salad as sides. My asparagus was tender-crisp and well trimmed. Salad was basic using Iceberg. Had a couple ugly pieces i picked out but nothing major. I had ranch dressing which was homemade but not fantastic nor horrible. There was some dried herb or flavor that did not seem authentic to my ranch tastes but it was edible. I would like to try their  porterhouse but im just not ready to pay $38 for one steak. Overall, very nice meal for 20 minutes down the road. I will be back.

After we sat down we waited at least 30 minutes before our drink order was taken. And even then it was the owner that finally came over to take it. After that it was another 20 or so minutes before the waitress came over to take our food order. Two tables were sat almost 30 minutes after us and received their drinks right away. We sat waiting for our food to come out for another 20 minutes before our appitizers came. The waitress then said that there were no more mashed potatoes, which is what my husband and I had ordered for our sides. We asked for baked potatoes instead. They were also out of that. Ok things happen. So we decided on fries and chips instead. Not even 5 minutes later the table behind us, one of the tables who was sat 30 minutes after us, got their food. Which included both mashed potatoes and baked potatoes. Up until this point we were a little annoyed but fine, this made it much worse. We had mostly lost our appetites by this time. We mentioned to the waitress about all of this and she apologized. Nothing was done to try and rectify the situation though. I would also like to make clear the fact that it was not very busy then we got there at about 8:30 so I did not understand why everything took so long. I am disappointed because we love the food here. I'll have to think long and hard about coming back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd42d282633a7:0x64cdb53202edfde7"}

The waitress stated yes! So my brother and I ordered porterhouses to be turned down five minutes later because they were out.\nAnd they could have a good beer selection but the beers I wanted to go out of too.\nI hope that the two times that I have visited this place was just bad luck but as of right now this is very poor Matt list because they didn't have anything on their menu that I wanted\nI would like to give it more stars the food was good but just due to the fact that I've been there twice and they don't have the options on the menu that I like and want this is very poor with me", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd42d282633a7:0x64cdb53202edfde7"}

This was NOT it. We had no idea what to expect and we did read other reviews that complained about the price but we have no issue, if the service is good and the food is quality, so we headed over to Fred and Lesters. We were thrown off from the beginning. People were smoking on the front porch when we got there and when we walked in we were greeted in the fashion you would expect from folks that were very disorganized. The atmosphere is ok for a family type country establishment but it is not a date night place-by any measure. All I thought of was \"based on the looks of this place, the steak must be truly amazing\" . We waited for 20 minutes and no one ever even acknowledged us. We finally asked someone if we had a server and she was kind enough to get someone to help us. Not going well so far but we were happy to finally have our drinks-which sat at the bar so long that we almost went up and just grabbed them ourselves. We ordered the fried green tomatoes and they were good and the sauce for the tomatoes was tasty. We were ready to order our dinner and the waitress came and explained to us that they were out of SEVERAL of the steaks-and I think they only had a total of 5 choices. They were out of porterhouse and they were out of another one-cant remember which one. I asked her which steak she recommended and she said the filet, which was my first choice-BUT then she told me that the filet was NOT part of the quality meat that they are supposedly known for. I asked her what that meant and she said \"it is basically grocery store\". So I kind of chuckled and ordered the rib eye.....I really did not know how to take that but it was kind of funny. My husband ordered the ribs. My steak came with a salad and it was truly the most pathetic little limp salad I have ever received-except for maybe the few times I had a salad at waffle house. Limp lettuce and served in a thin wood bowl, like you would purchase at The Dollar Store. I could not finish it. But we were there for the steak. We continued to sit and talk and noticed that they had a patio outside where music was playing and since our food was no where to be found-It had been 45 minutes since we ordered we went out the back door to see what the patio area was like. It is a cute little area and the band seemed like they were quite talented but I was shocked that they were serving food to people while groups of other people were sitting right on the patio area smoking. I am not that particular but it was pretty gross and the smell of cigarettes was very strong the second that back door opened. I really did not think this was allowed any longer by the Health Department but maybe it is. We went back inside and had simply had enough and asked the waitress where our food was. She was sweet and smiled and said she would check and by that time I explained to her that it had been a full hour. We waited another 10 minutes with no reply from her and then told her to get our check and we would not be staying any longer. She told the manager who came by and said very quietly \"Sorry about that\". That was it!!! And it was a very half-a-- apology. Basically I would not return if it was FREE. My time is more valuable then to spend it at an establishment that manages itself in this manner. On a side note-the waitresses congregate around the computer screen for ever. This establishment needs to move the computer screen to an area other than the middle of the restaurant so it is not so obvious that no one knows what they are doing. I felt strong enough about it to write this review in hopes that others do not waste their time or money.\nAdd to list\nEdit\nShare Your Review", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd42d282633a7:0x64cdb53202edfde7"}

We were greeted by a very sweet hostess who seated us and provided us with menus, specials and drinks to get us started . She was very efficient and super nice and carried on a great conversation about her college plans and that she attended the same school we all did . We asked questions about the menu options and she knew everything about the food and menu choices . I was very impressed with her knowledge of the restaurant and all the specials they had . I orderd the homemade chicken and dumplings and when I say homemade I felt as if I were eating my Grandmaw's chicken and dumplings from back in the day . I was super pleased with the food . My meal even came with a fresh tomato that was straight out of the garden . I also had fried okra and a huge helping of homemade macaroni . I felt as if I were eating a home cooked meal at my family gathering when I was growing up . Our tea glasses were constantly filled and we had plenty of food . Everyone was bragging amongst each other about how good the food was . My niece ordered the pot roast and she said it was delicious. Dad orderd hot wings and I believe Mom orderd the catfish plate . I topped off my meal with a slice of red velvet cake which was moist and just enough sweet taste to make you want to return for more . I hope this place continues their service to the community it is really a hidden gem in Akron Alabama just a few minutes passed Moundville . It is definately worth the trip . I will be back and also I want one of the Hunter's Family Restaurant T- Shirts ! Definately going back soon and will tell all my friends . SUPER delicious !", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8885ef8c647b24fd:0xa617a146bf1a887e"}

My daughter (who has a medical issue) said root beer, as I told her no due to the caffeine (diet restriction), the cashier jumped in and stated that Barq's Root Beer is Decaff.  Going against my better judgement I allowed her to get the Root Beer thinking maybe I was wrong.

Good though with their famous lemonade I always bought in brookwood mall homewood Alabama as an employee of both end chain stores when I was in retail employment. Things are vastly different these days. I took my minimum wages way more seriously than majority and as a result the easiest to be the odd ball Not defying the odds that hard work pays. It leaves you struggling in poverty. But Im sure that's bitterness rubbing off on me. Got a good photo as my other favorite thing to do getting odd shots most get paid big bucks in print media. My phone controls the best of me but I got this from my destination mall and purpose on a gorgeous stressfilled easter weekend. In auburn Alabama where I worked in undergraduate school there at now gone jcpennys and got my earring piercing on top of my ear that took a year to heal because I kept hitting it with the phone receiver back in 1989 rather than continue commuting on weekends back to my hometown birmingham mall as manager of lingerie and top sales in accessories. When stockings used with garter belts came 3 to a box and my thighs slightly smaller but not much. Its control top reinforced toe now for sharp talon nails on eagle soarers. My joke of the city. And the river a few miles before this chick-fil-a restaurant. If you ordered a ice cream cake from now replaced Badkung Robbins in toomers corner I made it as the cake maker/ decorator for a quarter. Loved that job slicing tubs of ice cream and layering with cake then icing with melted cream inside the cooler before piping your favorite slogan on it. Lastly, was now gone a different cooler in environmental management for water samples which storied life experienced escaped discussion in the water sludge cleaning treatment process I endured to get mosquitos in my puddled location.

After my order being messed up and one of my coworkers not getting lunch, I called and let them know the order was not included. This was around 11:30ish. The girl told me her general manager wasn\u2019t there and she would have to get approval from him to fix my order. And she tried telling me I would have to somehow prove that the order wasn\u2019t included, asked me to bring it all back up there when I had already distributed over 5 orders to my coworkers! Not even 20 minutes later Kayleen Turner called them and she says the general manager is there he is just busy, so they lied and she called them out on it and the girl had nothing to say but she offered to bring us the order. She didn\u2019t even want it anymore so she said no just to refund her money. I get a call HOURS later saying I would have to go in the store and get cash because they can\u2019t process it otherwise. Okay, cool. It was very inconvenient but sure. Shortly after they called me, they called Kayleen and she wasn\u2019t able to answer because she was in the middle of selling a car. So after, she called back and said \u201cHey I missed a call from y\u2019all, it was probably about the order for Alyson\u201d and the girl HUNG UP ON HER! So I went in and not once did the manager apologize, not once did she seem to care about the inconvenience, I even brought up the fact that her coworker lied to me on the phone and she said \u201cthe gm didn\u2019t get here until 11.\u201d I told her it was well after 11 that I called and she had nothing to say, did not apologize, just said \u201chave a good night.\u201d and quickly went on to help another customer. Y\u2019all after working in the food industry for so long, it baffles me how some fast food employees AND managers can be so unprofessional, especially when they work at the number one fast food restaurant in the country and are known for treating customers with kindness. I promise I never want to be THAT person, but there\u2019s only so far you can push me. I have never been one to try to lie and haggle to get free food out of any restaurant, and it pisses me off that THEY messed up my order, lied to me, treated me unprofessionally, but I am looked at by them as one of those customers that was there to cuss someone out over them leaving a chicken nugget out of my nugget meal. It is literally not hard at all to treat a customer the right way and I just can\u2019t comprehend how that is so hard for some people to understand. \ud83d\ude11", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546486752558, "text": "Hi, Alyson.

I normally let it go, but the one time I go back and say something the lady does not even apologize for leaving it out of my order.  So I call back to talk to the manager, she apologizes but does not offer to do anything about it or anything.  So when I ask are you going to do anything, she said it was just honey mustard.  That isn't the point, the point is you left it out of my bag when I requested it in there.  If I did not love Chick-fil-A so much and used to work there so I love supporting them I would not go back to this restaurant.  Note this has been the only Chickfila I have ever been too that I have had issues with.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1535494845844, "text": "Hi, Andrea!

When I came inside, there was only 1 person inside. They were soooo slow. I asked for some smokehouse chicken and the cashier was kind enough to ask me did I want fresh chicken, would I be willing to wait? I said sure. It was around 8ish so it wasn't busy. While waiting on some fresh chicken, I noticed some interesting facts. The health score was not posted or visible....then one of the employees said the health inspector put it in the men's bathroom....??? and the score was supposed to have been a 94..?? Also, the use of hair nets was not a practice. The fryers had  a bin up under it with with some type of yellow hose going into it...??? The cook did have a hat on and was trying to swap out the racks to place more chicken on it and it fell into the grease. He picked it up and just scraped off the stuck on crumbs with a scraper and sat it back down. I was shocked. All the while the cashier and another employee looking for the health score. They didn't find it  and she called the manager, but no one knew where it was...??? I was happy to get some fresh chicken and the cashier was nice enough to throw in a free biscuit. As I was leaving, one of the employees was taking a smoke break, sitting down  in front of the restaurant talking loud on the phone and using some choice words.The chicken was good.The environment and work stations need cleansing, up to date frying machines need to be installed and a refresher course on conversing in the midst of customers.

My adopted 81 year old Dad asked to speak to a manager. The host then got us a table after waiting 30 minutes. We looked in all corners and they were available tables everywhere. When the manager did come to our table I told her about our experience and  asked her why this happened and she explained she was short handed with staff and she was swamped with doing to go orders. If someone is in a wheelchair and I can't stand very long and there's no sense in them not offering at least a place that's available to sit until our table was available. I have a bad torn hamstring. If management don't get better we will take our business somewhere else. I will be contacting cooperate office. I have the manager's name's.

There were three factors. Baby Back Ribs were not properly cooked......an ongoing problem at all the locations in the Birmingham area.  I have learned to have a picture on my phone showing the proper preparation when I run into this problem.  As I was politely attempting to explain this issue with manager John Prince, Mr. Prince's attitude was hostile, uncooperative and confrontational. When I asked if he knew how they were supposed to be cooked, he replied, why don't you tell me how they are supposed to be cooked.    At this point I knew I needed to document the conversation and started my phone recorder.  Mr. Prince said I am not going to talk with that recorder on.  I asked Mr. Prince's name and he just stared at me.  I then prepared to leave and Mr. Prince said his name and walked off.  My waitress did a splendid job.  The issue with the ribs is they were pre-cooked as usual, but then they were not finished on the grill.  They were warmed up and BBQ sauce smeared on them. It appears that race may have even been an issue.......I am white and Mr. Prince is black. Mr. Prince never acknowledged the ribs were not properly cooked nor did he offer any apologies or consolation for my dining experience. At approximately 5:15 pm, Logan's District Mgr Charlie Eben called me in response to my complaint.  Mr. Eben assured me that employees would be retrained to insure that proper food preparation would result and the John Prince would also be counseled.  Sorry Mr. Eben!  I have heard promises like that too many times.  It is a roll of the dice no matter how many free meal cards you want to send me.  Your sincerity is in doubt.  There are too many good and quality companies out there with whom I will do business.  Just for the record, I am including a photo of your signature Baby Back Ribs when prepared properly.....and this photo was taken at the Trussville location several years ago when they were doing it right!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5meTA3g87mqIEgBhLxUFVvMvDBZsYFfZ7Pi9K=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOruS7JqwKqimfLfTToU9zMi6yQsE4lgxgHOyW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1488303649780, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

Another 10 minutes went by and I began to get upset because our placement should not be based on when another family finishes eating. We were about to get up and leave but a server came and got us, told us he was working a big party but he would be more than glad to serve us. Keep in mind the hostess never came by to address us again, nor did any manager. We would probably still be sitting there now if the server who was around the bar area did not offer to wait on us. Now granted I am not an unreasonable person nor am I impatient but the lack of professionalism displayed by the management team was unacceptable.

I finally had to call using my cell phone to get the girl up there. Also several employees saw me waiting and no one apparently cared enough to let the girl know I was there I guess. Noticed 4 manager cards on the front desk and wondered why the service is so bad. This could be a great place but you have to get a better staff.

Although my food was ok, my son's wings were fried really hard. He tried to eat them because he doesn't like to complain but I advised him that you should be satisfied with what you pay for. We sent the wings back and told the server that we would pay for the three wings he ate and ordered something else. The manager came out, not to apologize, but to tell us that we didn't need to pay for the three wings. Oh ok, thanks. Guess that was his solution to the problem but then we receive the replacement meal. The replacement meal that we paid full price for and paid extra to get an upgraded side of macaroni and cheese that came in a container that was less than half full. So what do we do? Pay the bill, tip the server her 20%, take the food and leave to not return any time soon until someone in management encourages the kitchen staff to always work hard at sending out quality food.

Over half of the restaurant was empty. Then they seated four 2 tops before me and my wife and 1 child. Even though we were next in line according to the hostess. I can understand seating 2 tops over 3 because they are busy and that's what's available but they had half of the restaurant empty. There was no reason to adhere to section integrity when tables are open. Then they were out of the steak I ordered and when the steak I chose  was served it was cold.\n\nIn the end the food wasn't bad but wasn't worth what I paid or the 2 plus hours we spent there. I have finally learned my lesson and will never ever give them another chance.\n\nWe never heard from a manager to explain what was going on. Just a young sweet girl and an overwhelmed waitress.\n\nI've said it before but now it's definitely true. I will never ever eat at any Logan's again anywhere in the country. Pathetic at best.

Hands down the WORST dining experience I've ever had in my 30 years. The wait wasn't too terribly bad, but after we were seated was terrible.\n\nMy roommate, her son, her girlfriend, and I were sat and promptly greeted by our server. We each ordered drinks, and then our food. The salads were pretty good, but then things took a U-turn.\n\nOur food was first brought out to the table next to us. When we brought this to the attention of the server who brought it, he said \"Let me go check the ticket.\" I know from some knowledge shared with me that when that happens, a fresh order is to be made because it touched the table. So the same man finally brings us our food, with the exception of my roommate, which I happen to know is another mistake, as we should have all been served together. I should also note these plates were the same ones as before, which I happen to know because I had a clear line of sight to the kitchen from where we were sitting. This is a health violation.\n\nSo after bringing our steaks out, I notice mine is undercooked (I ordered medium and got medium rare). My roommate's girlfriend's steak has been cut into, which is ANOTHER huge no-no. When this was brought to the attention of the man who brought them out (the same man I mentioned before), he claimed that was how it was cooked and acted as if he didn't care when we stuck a knife straight through the pre-existing hole in the middle of the steak.\n\nAfter the guy walks off, my roommate's girlfriend goes to our server and asks to speak with a manager. Our server points directly at THE GUY WHO HAD BROUGHT US OUR FOOD. You remember him- the rude one. So she asks if there is another manager around. Keep in mind that my roommate still hasn't seen the first morsel of her food. She informs her that the other manager's name is Jennifer and she will be right over. Jennifer was great and went above and beyond to try and turn our visit around. She quickly explains she will check on my roommate's food and bring fresh steaks out to replace the ones we had.\n\nMy roommate finally gets her food, and there is cinnamon all over her baked sweet potato- which she specifically ordered without cinnamon. But there is also cinnamon all over her steak- why would the steak have cinnamon on it in the first place? So they bring out a fresh potato, which tastes like it's been sitting out for about 2-3 days before it was brought out to the table.\n\nMy roommate's girlfriend and I finally get our fresh steaks, and mine is RARE when I cut into it- worse than before.\n\nWe left not having to pay for any of our food, including what my roommate's son ate because his was fine- but I still won't be back.

Let me say I've been to this Logan's many times since it opened, in fact it use to be one of my favorite restaurants in Trussville, but that has definitely changed. We got there a little after 2 PM and had to wait for a table until almost 3 PM. Now, I understand it was a Saturday, so even though it was annoying I was willing to look past it. Once we sat down, we sat there for 45 MINUTES without anyone even acknowledging that we were there. My uncle had to get up and go find someone to even get them to come take our drink order. After finally placing our drink order, it took another 45 minutes to get our drinks...and most of us ordered WATER. Our waitress had a terrible attitude,  we didn't even get our food until almost 5 PM, and once we did get it, it was not good. 3 1/2 hours for what should have been a simple lunch, when most of it was due to sitting around waiting on someone to even acknowledge that we were there is ridiculous. If it hadn't been for my grandmother refusing to leave, we would have left. And then, when my uncle asked about getting a discount, because there was no way we were paying full price for the terrible service, the manager had the nerve to ask \"Why do you need a discount?\" Even the management didn't seem to care.

However, after this pass weekend, they left me no choice. My fiance' and I go to Logan's faithfully, so needless to say, we have spent too much money in this place to be treated the way we were. The service and food quality has really gone down hill. Quite frankly, I can see why they're having to close so many locations now because the competition is better. Granted, all of the other Logan's in this city ARE indeed horrible, but this one was still the best in my book. That is no longer that case!\n\nFirst of all, we ordered a basket of fried pickles, and we received a half of half basket of fried pickles. I would rather they just told us they were out rather than bring us what they did. We ate those because we were hungry, it was getting late, and we expected a much better dinner than appetizer. It got no better! We waited over 30 minutes for food, and when we got it, most of it was cold as hell. I guess our waitress forgot about it and left it on the counter. My fiance' had meatloaf that was not thoroughly cooked in certain areas, he never got the fries he ordered, so he practically left everything on his plate, he never touched the mashed potatoes and gravy. Our waitress took up our concerns with the manager about our 30-minute wait and the missing items, and as a courtesy she removed 3 whole dollars from our ticket. That was the cost of a side! Gee thanks! You took off what exactly? Our taxes off one of our sides! Then she goes on to explain that they had a party of 35 people come in that they had no idea was coming. That's great, but what the hell does that have to do with us? That's not our problem!! If your business can't serve large parties while maintaining the quality and integrity of your food to all other visitors then you SHOULDN'T be in business... PERIOD!\n\nBasically, we paid full price for horrible food and horrible service. It's sad because we WERE faithful customers, and Logan's just lost us. On top of that, we were not the only people complaining about them when we left. They had people in the waiting area and parking lot who were also not very happy with them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459727596332, "text": "We appreciate your positive feedback!

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes.

We ordered the filet med/rare it was more rare than med/rare but I was ok with that mine had hardly any flavor at all to it. Our potatoes was not quiet done and my salad was ordered with 1000 island dressing which I usually love at Logan's but the dressing here looked like 1000 island but tasted like French.\n\nTHE SERVICE\nOur waitress was nice and friendly enough. A little hard to catch her attention when I was not real sure if ahe had brought me unsweat tea instead of sweet tea but once we finally got het attention she did everything she could to make it better. So no complaints there.\nAPPEARANCE\nClean the restrooms needed some attention but once it was relayed to the staff they were made aware of the fact that they needed attention and so I assume that was taken care of.\n\nOVER ALL EXPERIENCE\nIt wasnt so bad that I wouldn't go back but will make sure to be more specific in my ordering as well as asking questions to make sure my idea of sweet tea and theirs is the same.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1550865442623, "text": "We appreciate you taking the time to review your experience, Pamela.

The last 2 times we have come it has not been a good experience. Either the food is subpar or the service or both. Tonight we waited over 10 minutes to even be greeted. We had to get up and say something to the hostess for someone to come to the table. Well, then we waited another 5-10 minutes for drinks and rolls. I know it took our door an hr to come out. We were about to walk out. This was not a good experience at all. I ordered a filet, grilled shrimp, broccoli and rice pilaf. The shrimp was cold and the steak was not cooked as I ordered. The brocolli arrived later after I told the waiter jt was missing. My kids did not have their condiments with the food. My daughter didn't even eat hers because she said it was nasty.

Yesterday June 11th my family and I went there for my daughter's birthday dinner. We got seated right away. But then it took 10 minutes before the waitress came to take our drink orders. This was shocking since the restaurant was fairly empty. Also The waitress tried to bring my daughter Coca-Cola  twice when she had sweet tea that was empty . But that is not a big deal. Upon receiving our steaks That's when we were told that what my youngest daughter ordered they did not have. They asked her to re-order while the rest of us had our food in front of us.\nI am not the type of parent that will eat in front of my child that has nothing. At that point I asked to speak to the manager. I watched as the waitress went over to the manager and told her I would like to see her. But she did not come right over. It took at least five minutes before she came to see what was going on. I explained what had happened and she did not even apologize. I asked her what we can do at this point. She said she would take our food back and make sure that we all got them served at the same time. It just did not sit right with me that she did not apologize and I had to ask what we can do to fix the situation. At that point I asked her for a check because we were leaving. It was then she just pointed towards the door. Again not apologizing or saying you don't owe anything. Just pointing towards the door. So we walked out and left the food on the table To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I especially felt bad for my daughter who just wanted to eat there on her birthday. Judging by the other reviews and my experience.

My salad came out with my dinner, my son had to ask 3 times to get water and more bread. My order was wrong and my to go order for my husband came out to me plated. His side salad never came with his order. I waited 20 min for a box to take our nasty food home to give to our dog. When I asked the waitress if she could get my to go side salad as fast as she could (seeing that I already paid for it and I over paid on my bill) there was literally about 3-4 bites of lettuce. My son had practice at 6:00 and it was close to 5:50. Mind you we we got there at 4:45 and ordered right away with our drink order. We were done eating before 5:30. This is a real shame since my son is obsessed with your dinner rolls and we frequently dine there. I will never go back again. I paid for things I didn't get. I don't know if the cook was new but my steak had so much seasoning on it it was barely edible. I scraped as much off as possible. If our waitress would have been more attentive I would have said something. We spent too much of our time seated with no one taking care of us. Even when I said I have to go please give me my receipt to sign, she dropped it off with no pen. Leaving me to have to chase down another waitress to borrow her pen. As horrible as it was our waitress was kind when at our table (twice).

But now my friend and I look back (2-3 days later) because we're still distraught over our experience, there were several red flags, which started from the moment we walked in to be seated.\n\n1.  When we walked in to be seated there was a customer complaining about there service and how they never received items that they ordered.\n\n2.  The first thing we noticed once seated (which was promptly considering they weren't busy at all) was the table across from us hadn't been cleaned.\n\n3.We sat for about 15 minutes before a server (black male). finally came to our table.  He stands there with his arms crossed speaking abruptly says, \"have y'all decided what you you want to order\". Without a greeting or introducing himself, we were caught off guard because it felt like he was a drill Sargent commanding us to order our food! We ordered and noticed his arms were still crossed AND noticed he wasn't writing down our order!  It felt as if someone made him come to serve our table.\n\n4.  While we were enjoying our appetizer, which a nice, cheerful young lady brought to us, he returns once to let us know since it was 2:44 p.m., it was too early to put our order into the system because  it's a certain time to order the 2 for $15.99 special, which we understood.\n\nAs a result of not writing down our order initially he came back to ask what our orders were again!  Then shortly after that, the initial young lady comes back to ask my friend what his entree was.\n\n5.  Also, while we initially started eating our appetizer, we noticed there were no napkins.  My friend had to get up (while on crutches and wearing a boot) had to go find us napkins!\n\n6.  The entrees were served and the first thing I noticed was my salmon seemed very dry and I thought it was because the oil topping was missing.  I also noticed I received a mushroom skewer, which I'm allergic to mushrooms.  I was supposed to receive the veggie skewer.\n\n7.  The table across from us still hasn't been cleaned, this has been after sitting there over an hour (2:30 - 3:30 at least) looking at it.\n\n8.  After talking to the sweet manager and explaining to her that this could be a training moment for our server(at this point we hadn't started eating to notice the actual condition of our food), by this time,  we're frustrated and ready to leave.\n\n9.  While the female manager was adjusting our ticket to remove the appetizer, I noticed my food wasn't cooked properly.  The sweet potato wasn't cooked all the way through!\n\nMy friend has to get up once again, now to request carry out containers because we haven't seen our server lately except from across the room while he was just standing there talking to someone.\n\nThe server comes to ask if we need carry out containers.

We waited 30 min to get our drinks and bread and 45 min for our wing appetizer. When we asked why he told us the kitchen was backed up. When my salad came it had no avocados and he said they were out. They brought my husband steak without his side of ceasar salads that came 20 min later. The steak was not seasoned had to use steak sauce. My daughter asked for extra queso which took 15 min to get her food was cold by the time it came out. The manager came out and explained the kitchen was not backed up and explained Dusty was new and he brought me the avocado they were out of. They discounted our food, but the hassle killed our appetite. I forgot to add that my frozen margarita was brought to me on the rocks. When i reminded Dusty i askex for frozen he said i know.

Merrell's  Take this as a formal caution to stay away from B.Merrell\u2019s. I\u2019ve been a server there for a few months now and was terminated today. Why you ask? Because I chose to call out their clear and blatant negligence in regards to Covid. I\u2019m not even talking about wearing masks. Over ten employees have covid or covid like symptoms. When I and fellow employees expressed our concerns we were ignored time and time again. Check out the screenshots I\u2019ve provided as proof.\n\nMost if not all employees agreed that we should be shut down for the time being. All of our concerns were ignored but management was still able to ask someone to pick up a shift and that\u2019s when I\u2019d had it. You can read the message I replied with down below. Then today all employees were called to be notified that we would be shutting down the inside but still be open curbside. What a coincidence!\n\nIt was only after management was called out that any action was taken. This has been going on for over a week now and only today they decided to close and again after they were called out. We were also told we would not be receiving unemployment because we still had the option to work curbside. Soon after I received a text from Barry Merrell himself telling me that because I said that in our private server group chat that I was terminated.\n\nAs I said in my prior message I would never want to work or eat in an establishment that so blatantly disregards not only the health and safety of its employees but it\u2019s customers as well.\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb32ff6ae64f:0x5c87bb6518777bca"}

It seems that you did receive service from the backup or the manager on duty. That doesn\u2019t excuse the cashier.

I went to the manager who was so helpfull and got us fresh sweet potato fries and ranch & fixed the bread on the sandwich.

Our outdoor business more than doubled. We had to experiment using trial and error to come up with systems to deal with the business.\nWe think now, however, we have a pretty good system and it\u2019s been going pretty good. Often during volume we have as many as 3 people answering phones at the same time. It sounds like you fell through the cracks. Again, I\u2019m sorry.\nPlease call me at your convenience. I\u2019d love to discuss the specifics of your experience. Things like the day, time of day, how long you were on hold each time, etc will be discussed.\nPlease believe I\u2019m not questioning you.

However, is extremely expensive and requires you to try things that you might not like. That is part of the fun of it! It can take years to finish your name on the wall, possibly your picture and prizes along the way.\nThe wait staff is helpful, but I'm not a fan of the strict rules that they have for their staff. Some of it is over the top. Such as no dark nail polish or black nail polish.\nThey have TVs at the bar and all around that they play news and sports or maybe they'll even change it for you. I've never asked. However, we almost always sit outside because I enjoy the outdoors and the inside can become Extremely Loud and excessively crowded. Since I'm not a fan of big crowds and packed out places we prefer to sit outside.\nAccording to my husband the wings are fantastic! I've only ever had the steak fries because it's one of the few places you can get steak fries. They make their ranch dressing in house and that is a perk anywhere you go if you are a ranch dressing fan.\nThey have a small game area for kids with a claw machine and a few other games that I'm not sure what they are. However, it's enough to keep them occupied long enough for parents to finish their meal or enjoy a drink before heading on to their next destination.

I never had to wait on a drink and he was polite and I could tell he knew what he was doing. He is the sole reason they even got 2 Stars. The food.....Oh the food. It was absolutely terrible. It was my wife's birthday and she really wanted to go here. It was my first time. I ordered some lobster tails she had the ultimate feast. When I got my food a $40 meal, my lobster was like a rubber band ball it was disgusting. I could barely rip it apart with my fingers. It could literally bounce. I had to cut it with a steak knife. I should have been fluffy, buttery and savory. I know it's not an ocean side restaurant but with a name like Red lobster I figured the lobster would be decent. I was so let down. Please make sure your cooks can at the most cook lobster. How is a place named Red Lobster serving such terribly cooked lobster. Your chef clearly doesn't belong at your store.  My in-laws ordered fish and chips. The fish had to have been dipped and breaded 15 times before it hit the fryer. When they finished they had almost an entire plate of batter that they picked and pealed off their fish. I was so embarrassed taking them here. My kids ordered the sirloin steak, they claimed to like it but they are kids, kids like anything. The steaks looked pretty beaten up and over cooked. Thank you Arthur for offering to replace the meal with a better cooked one,( \"which I turned down\" ) and thank you for being a fantastic server! I know that's a tough job. You were worth the $50 tip I left you. But Red Lobster I beg you to hire some efficient chefs and focus on training your cooks how to properly prepare lobster, steak and even a simple fish and chips. Find people who want to be there and who care weather their food is good. I'm not asking you to fire this person that cooked our food tonight but at the very least spend hours retraining them to cook your food the way it should be. I can't imagine how much money your company wastes throwing away food that was cooked terribly. I'm not sure I'll ever go to another Red lobster again which stinks because my wife raved about it, but it was just upsetting. I hope anyone who reads this doesn't have the same experience. I work too had for my $$$ to have someone not care how their food turns out. I don't blame red Lobster as I don't know their current situation but they have to know that their cook is not very good.

I was taken aback and perhaps this is on me for simply not getting up and walking out or bringing it up real time. This whole situation we all find ourselves in is awkward for all involved.  However, it is not on the customer's shoulders to enforce state rules. I just don't get it since it seemed most if not all of the other employees had appropriate facial covering.  Rationally I can tell myself that the exposure risk was probably low. On the other hand should I be having to go through that because a restaurant/employee couldn't be respectful of their customers?\n\nUpdate 3 weeks later:  Although I never received anything other than a canned response on Yelp in spite of contacting them via their website, I made a visit last night in hopes of finding improvement and dinning. Well, incredulously, it was worse!  The State's mask orders are still in effect. Opening the door and entering this time even the host doesn't have a mask and the first server we see - no mask. We turned and walked out.  You have to ask yourself what kind of corporate/management approach so blatantly violates an obvious and easily implementable order. And if they have this disregard about the things you can see then what about those things you can't even during non-pandemic times.\n\nThis can be done correctly. I've witnessed it at many other both local and chain establishments.

It all started when I asked for water, no lemon, and get brought back water with lemon. Not that big of a deal, it happens, simple mistake. I very foolishly paid for our food at the table tablet early as we were a bit short on time and wanted to leave as soon as we were done. Our food arrived and the steak was over done like shoe leather, the lobster tail was like eating a rubber band, and the side of fries was missing. The shrimp was at least alright. Our waitress was not seen again for 20+ minutes. She finally came back around, we mentioned some issues, and she vanished again. After several minutes, we caught some other waitress nearby and asked for a manager. After another 15+  minutes of no manager nor our waitress being seen, we left as we simply had no more time to waste dealing with this ordeal, we were already late at this point. We didn't get all the ordered food and half of what we did get wasn't even edible.

There\u2019s nothing fresh about it. I have nothing negative to say regarding the staff. They seem like they work extremely hard. Sometimes it seems like they\u2019re just holding on. Much respect.

The server was very obviously annoyed that we were in her section. She walked up and introduced herself with an irritated vibe (she also added to her introduction that she was going to get us out of there fast due to the bad weather, which wasn't that bad) and asked for our drink orders then walked away without another word. Any time she came to the table she barely spoke beyond necessity, we would thank her for various things and she did not once acknowledge us. She brought half of my order out and I suppose my face expressed a question and she stared at me... the appropriate thing to say is, \" Can I get you anything else?\" I finally said, \"Is the soup coming out now or later?\" Her reply? \"No, it's coming out now...\" and a brisk walk away. To make dinner less enjoyable the staff were definitely not using professional language when they were in the kitchen (my table was next to the kitchen).The food was decent (hardly agree with the price verses value) but the service made the whole experience...

We ate here because we got a giftcard for Christmas and it turned out to be a big mistake. We ordered an appetizer, soup, salad, and dinner entree. Our appetizer came out and the waiter set it down on the table and quickly walked away as I was trying to tell him he didn't give us any plates or forks. So from the get go I was irritated. We tried to flag several people down and were ignored each time. So after getting no help we started eating our shrimp appetizer with our hands. Finally a different server helped us and got us some forks. But still no plates. Our appetizer was gone by the time our original waiter finally came back to the table and mumbled \"I shoulda been brought these out to ya\" at me and finally got us plates and biscuits. Then our dinner entrees were brought out by yet another different server. We tried to ask for our soup and salad but she turned and walked away so quickly I don't think she heard me. We had nearly finished our dinner entrees by the time our original server came to check on us, and instead of apologizing for the mistake just said \"yeah I know\" when I said we had ordered a soup and salad. If you know, then where is my food? We both finished our dinner entrees before he brought our soup and salad out and by that point we were already full. I paid $8 for a bowl of soup I didn't even eat. The manager comped one of our meals but I will never go back there after that experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1550685082849, "text": "Hi,Caitlyn Hoppe.

I Ordered food online was late to make sure the food would be ready (9:52) the food wasnt brought out until after 10:15. No problem.... Things Happen...but then the biscuits were burned (paid for these extra biscuits, I wish I could attach pics) asked for new biscuits and decided to order a chilled shot of patron. The bartender PUTS ICE WATER IN GLASS (in a poor attempt to chill the glass) and pours the warm shot in the glass. This is not chilled, strike 2. Asked for a lime after we had to wait to get her to turn and we were the only 2 people at the bar besides the bartender. The bartender LITERALLY brought a lime with her BARE HANDS and said here you go. No napkin, no tooth pick, straight hand to hand contact. Clearly she should have not been working the bar. Didn't even want the drink just wanted to kill time until the food came back that they screwed up. Paid for the drink and she says have a good one. WHERE ARE MY BISCUITS???? she NEVER brought them back out. I said forget it and left with the burned biscuits which are inedible. This is the LAST time I will visit this red lobster. Until they revamp and retrain their staff... They have lost 2 customers. I mean the carpet even stinks here, you can smell it reeking and there is so much dust your allergies with not like you.

I've gone to Red Lobster numerous times, too many too count. I have had many instances of unsatisfactory service (the latest being 5 minutes ago) but I give them chances because they are one of a few seafood restaurants in this area. And I love my snow crab. I Ordered food online was late to make sure the food would be ready (9:52) the food wasnt brought out until after 10:15. No problem.... Things Happen...but then the biscuits were burned (paid for these extra biscuits, I wish I could attach pics) asked for new biscuits and decided to order a chilled shot of patron. The bartender PUTS ICE WATER IN GLASS (in a poor attempt to chill the glass) and pours the warm shot in the glass. This is not chilled, strike 2. Asked for a lime after we had to wait to get her to turn and we were the only 2 people at the bar besides the bartender. The bartender LITERALLY brought a lime with her BARE HANDS and said here you go. No napkin, no tooth pick, straight hand to hand contact. Clearly she should have not been working the bar. Didn't even want the drink just wanted to kill time until the food came back that they screwed up. Paid for the drink and she says have a good one. WHERE ARE MY BISCUITS???? she NEVER brought them back out. I said forget it and left with the burned biscuits which are inedible. This is the LAST time I will visit this red lobster. Until they revamp and retrain their staff... They have lost 2 customers. I mean the carpet even stinks here, you can smell it reeking and there is so much dust your allergies with not like you. It's a shame you spend all this money for subpar quality. Shame on you Red Lobster!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

He is 85 and a veteran from World War II, Vietnam, and Korea. He retired to   Huntsville almost 30 years ago. He has been going to the Red Lobster there for 30 years.  We had our meal and he insisted on paying the bill. He handed me his wallet which had 3 crisp 50 dollars bills inside. He asked to take two and put them in with the bill.... he wanted to pay the 47 dollar bill and get change to tip the waiter.  I removed the two bills and he ask that i lay them side by side in the envelope so that they did not get stuck together and so the waiter could see there were two and not just one. The lunch was slow taking almost two hours to complete so he finally asked if we could make our way to the car while my wife stayed and waited for the change.  i brought him to the car and we waited for another 20 minutes but my wife did not come.  Finally she did come out and was blown away.  The waiter came back by the table and through the plastic bill holder on the table and said there was no bill or money inside and that he was reprinting the bill for my wife to pay again. I went back into the restaurant to talk to the waiter, but he wouldn't even talk he left for a bit and the manager came out to talk to me. He said that i must have dropped the money and the bill and asked if it was in my pockets. I explained that I knew for sure the money was there because my dad had asked be to take the money from his wallet and to lay the bills next to each other so not to have a mis understanding and that i had closed the plastic envelope before is left and my wife had not even touched it.. only the waiter had touched it.  The manager did not seem to know what to do, but said if i left my number he would call if it turned up. It was a bad situation for everyone. The lady;s sitting across from us leaned over to my wife and said ' we saw you pay the bill\"...  I finally decided that having my dad at the restaurant for 2 and a half hours was too long for him to be up so I just told them to keep our money and i left.  I guess i was hoping that the manager would say here is your 40 dollars change you asked for and we will find this mis-placed bill and work it out... i understand it is a bad situation but my dad now will never go back after 30 years and is telling everyone he sees about the lost of  his money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

It would have been nice to have a complimentary appetizer or two brought to the table by the manager to appologize for the excessive wait time. Nope. So we resorted to asking the waitress for bread which they despise because they are not supposed to bring them out till after you order.

The service was very poor (despite not being particularly busy, in the ~2 hours of our being there, the server only voluntarily visited our table 3-4 times).\n\nAs for the meal itself, the iced tea I was served tasted funny. The dish I ordered had a choice of New York Strip or Filet Mignon and, despite not indicating a preference, the server never asked me which I\u2019d like. The Caesar salad had maybe 3-5 shavings of parmesan on it and the lettuce was rather limp and not crisp. The shrimp scampi was fine; it tasted of garlic and not much else. The wood-grilled shrimp was meh; it was lackluster in terms of flavor, due in part to its complete lack of seasoning. In general everything was pretty bland.The \u201csteamed\u201d broccoli was instead maybe half-steamed, i.e. it was half-raw, therefore rather crunchy. And even the ~$11 Lobster Tail was over-cooked, dry, and bland (also it wasn\u2019t served with butter).\n\nBased on this experience, I would recommend going to a different location or, if you find that the quality does not improve elsewhere, pick a different restaurant altogether. 3/10.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

There weren't that many people there. Stopped at the hostess stand and she was on the phone talking to someone about a lost article. No big deal so we waited several minutes while she finished her phone conversation. There was also a male employee who was stacking menus who just ignored us. The female hostess gets off the phone and seats us. We look through the menu and make our selections. I realized that we still had not even been greeted even though 3 other tables had been seated after us and were approached by their waiters and were given drinks and biscuits. Still no waiter even though there were two waiters standing by our booth right behind my husband. Our booth was at the end so they were just a couple of feet from us and I am sure that they could hear our conversation wondering why we didn't have a waiter. At that point I pulled out my cellphone to keep track of the time. We had been sitting there for almost fifteen minutes when a female waiter passed us and said our waiter would be there in just a minute. A few minutes more went by before a female waiter who had an order of food to deliver paused at our table and asked if we knew what we wanted to drink. I told her that we had been sitting there for quite some time and already knew what we wanted to order to eat. She said okay that she would be right back and would take good care of us. I saw her deliver the food and then go to another table to take their order. My husband and I just looked at each other and got up and left. I can't believe that there were waiters standing around and nobody had waited on us in all that time. It was inexcusable and I will be sure to let everyone we know what poor service we were given.

This time, Niadja, our waitress was caring; but she gave us dinner pricing when our visit was at lunchtime. Is it legal to charge dinner prices at lunch claiming that the sizes are larger without notice or consent from the customer? We never got the towelettes we requested until the end, either.  In Japan, for instance, a nice hot cloth towel is afforded to the patrons prior to eating. On the same note, Japanese peeps don\u2019t wear shoes indoors either so why would we expect for an American restaurant to provide us hand wipes prior to eating? Our seats were too close together, so we moved. But, the table we moved to wobbled and caused damages to us as well as to our belongings. Thomas, the manager was rude and indifferent. Niadja was to apply a $4.00 coupon which led to our finding out about the pricing deceit. Our hot-spot was being used; but Thomas wouldn't let us use their DSL to get the $4.00 coupon from our Trash. Thank GOD $4.00 won't break us since GOD has given us so much. It's the principal of the matter, though. On our visit previously, a man came in seeking stuff and it was not until he started to bother other guests did management ask him to leave. Plus $1000 was stolen from an acquaintance of ours from her purse while she and her friends were eating there a while ago. On second thought, the people there are very unhappy, the waitresses never smile and purposely catch your eye only to give you a mean look.

When I was giving my order for my whole family, anytime I added anything else this young man Taking my orders seemed to throw his hands around and roll his eyes as if it bothered him I was getting more than one thing. I noticed when I moved up one car length at a time through the drive-thru, i noticed he seem to be doing this with everyone, not just me. As I got up to the window he let me sit at the window for about five minutes with the line backed all the way up before he even had the drinks ready like usual or my order paid for just standing at the screen taking orders\u2026 but the line wasn\u2019t moving. While the food has always been good here for me, service is more important. It turns out this is the owner son, Nick, who is so bothered by taking orders to the drive-thru. After I sat at the window waiting for him to take my card to pay for my meal for about 5 to 6 minutes, Allena(I assume was her name, it was on my receipt the lady handed me)  finally came to the window, gave me my food, and helped clear out the drive-through line because it seemed like Nick wasn\u2019t doing anything. I could hear him cursing and see him throwing his hands around anytime more than one thing was added to an order if he were to say \u201cis there anything else?\u201d not to mention my meals were cheeseburgers with everything but pickles onion and tomato, and i got plain burgers with ONLY pickles onions and tomatoes..\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbMaybe it seems like because he\u2019s the owner son he can act how he wants\u2026 That doesn\u2019t get you very good service reviews and I most likely will not be back to this location, Because while the food can be great, the service still means more.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611713602314, "text": "Tamera,\n\nThank you for letting me know about your experience.
