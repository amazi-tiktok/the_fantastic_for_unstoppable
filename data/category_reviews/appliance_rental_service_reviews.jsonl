(i have leased with this company on a previous occasion, my experience at that time was very sub par. the delivery was late and the dryer power cord  was damaged to the point of causing property damage to my wall plug in my home.) A red headed woman approached the counter with no mask and asked me \"how can i help you?\", i replied i am looking to lease a laptop. she then told me \"i have the desktop over there\" i stated then what kind of laptops do you have \" the kind that turn on!\" she stated. so i disregarded her unprofessional remark still uneasy about both employees not having on a face covering, and asked to know my options of computer choices. she then with an attitude that i was an inconvenience to her began putting laptop boxes on the counter. i read the specifications and made my choice. she asked if i had leased with them before, i stated yes. it had been more than 30 days since my last lease so i was directed to fill out another lease application. during this time of filling out the application i came to find out the employee that was behaving in this manner was the general manager. she then informed me while i was filling out the rental application that she \"hated these mask\" and that i did not have to wear mine while in the store. i was now fully uncomfortable from a collection of lack of safety procedure during a pandemic. i continued to wear my mask. once the application was complete another employee then took a copy of my drivers license. the general manager took another 10 minutes to ask me to please come into her office. she was pulling up things on her computer. she then turned to me and rolled her eyes and said\" so you have rented from us before huh? \" i said yes i have multiple times. she then proceeded to question why i was late on my rental payment. i told this brute of a woman that i had financial hardship and lost my job at the time. i got behind on the lease and once i realized i could no longer afford to get the payments from these loan sharks up to date due to exorbitant late fees and penalties i returned the leased merchandise. she then stated that she \"believed in giving second chances\". i  acknowledged the comment but did not rebut to the comment. she then looked over more information on her computer. and turned to me and said \" being late im ok with, but people keeping merchandise that is not theirs im not ok with!!\" at this point i have become very uncomfortable and feel as if my visit to the store this day has become a humiliation session for the store manager. i stopped the woman and told her i felt degraded and would no longer like to do business with this establishment. she then laughed at me and said \" fine then\". i contacted the corporate office for this company and was informed they condone this behavior. a few notes if you intend to rent from this establishment, you may be exposed to covid 19 by employees or other patrons due to lack of adherence of mask mandate while in this location or lease merchandise that has not been sanitized properly. you will be belittled by the staff if you ever have financial hardship while in a lease agreement with this company as well. i hope this review is helpful to those thinking of leasing from this company. i would recommend the better competitor YOURWAY RENT TO OWN which is located at 2547 Bob Wallace ave. when i left this establishment i went to your way and was able to lease a laptop computer in less than 15 minutes without being belittled or shamed. (quick your way rent to own history) they do not charge daily late fees(best ways policy is built to extort with late fees)  when a payment may be late and will work with you if you hit financial hardship. also the merchandise is of higher quality, the facility is cleaner, with more inviting more professional staff. stay safe out there in this pandemic!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c968658c4e5:0xe253ce2faeb99938"}
