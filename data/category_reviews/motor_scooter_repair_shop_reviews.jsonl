Ask lady behind the counter why the price difference and she couldn't give a straight answer then proceeded to say that the OWNER wrote a 6 instead of 9 and they were $995.00 not $695.00 as written on the tags of the others.  Then the gentleman that was behind the counter came out on the showroom floor and says \"OH NO I CANT SELL THEM FOR THAT AND I CANT EVEN BUY THEM FOR THAT PRICE and proceeded to snatch the price tags off the ones that had a tag marked $695.00 on them in front of us.    Ask if he would sell for the price that was on it prior to him snatching the price tag off and he RUDELY said NO.  I am a small business owner myself, and would never have done this to a customer, especially pulling off price tags in front of a customer and telling them I can't honor the price tag that is on the item because of a mistake that was made by the owner of the busiess.  Honor the price that is on the tag and then correct the price issue after the customer has left the busines.\nSo buyer beware of this place of business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624729985517, "text": "I'm sorry you feel the need to try to hurt our business due to a small error.

Joe was EXTREMELY gracious, knowledgeable, friendly and laid back - he's just like a longtime friend that you haven't seen in awhile!  We decided on a white Wolf, full face helmet and alarm system.  The purchase process was very smooth and easy.  Joe answered all our questions and concerns and assured us that delivery could be expected in a few days.  Sure enough, 4 days later we returned to pick up the Wolf - it was all prepared and ready to go - just as Joe assured us it would be.  My grandson was so excited!  After break-in, we returned the Wolf to Joe for fluid changes and adjustments and again had a most pleasurable experience; the maintenance took only a few minutes; Joe even provided my grandson with several shaded sun shields.

The $30 per tire was a labor only quote that was made clear at the time the unit was quoted. Customer requested two new tires and when the tech disassembled the bike, noticed it was missing key safety strips on the rim, one tube was deteriorated, and replaced out of safety concern and the longevity of the repair. The additional items and Alabama mandatory tire sales fee were the only charges the customer wasn\u2019t aware of. The customer was phoned to be informed, but didn\u2019t  answer the phone during the servicing, so that we could make him aware of the extra needed items.  When the customer arrived to pick up the unit, and was presented the repair bill, he was adamant that he wasn\u2019t going to pay for the extra items, so it was offered to remove the items and return his original equipment.  In the end the shop owner marked down the cost of the repair and the shop gave the customer a free tube to help ease the cost of the repair.

We never presumed you to be an idiot,  but you have to also understand business are different independent franchises.  Our prices at the time you visited this dealership reflected the total price out the door with all applicable state and local taxes and freight charges for the particular unit you were interested in. At this particular time we also has packaged prices for machines that included 5 years worth of warranty, jacket, helmet, and gloves. When you call different dealers in different areas they have the ability to quote you a machine at a lesser price and once your in the closing office they introduce the total price including the added fees. Something you overlook when ranting about our prices in this review, I'm sure.  The same goes for where you choose to purchase your auto, boat, or RV.

As well as, when a customer drops off a machine and doesn't complete reveal the entire back story. This may not be the case in this particular situation, but in many instances maintenance becomes a can of worms, and if the machine is to work properly (for which it was brought to the dealership) there are additional things to be performed.
