We set up a tee time the day before for Saturday. We traveled about 40 mins to the course. It was right off the highway into a gated golf community. Right from the start we were greeted by the staff. Upon entering the clubhouse, I was amazed at the initial set up of the course. My co-worker had to rent some clubs, at which they were very accommodating by giving him a brand new set of Nike Vapors. I had the Coverts 2.0 from the previous year and was impressed at the rentals they provided. We went to the driving range and then the putting green and we were off. Long story short, the course was AWESOME and the view was even better. We found ourselves stopping to take pictures and taking in the view (Which I rarely do on course). What I thought was to be a 6 hr round (because of our relax play at each hole) was a little over 4 hrs. This course is in my TOP 5 best courses I've played in my life, (I've played in the range of 50-60 different courses). I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys a challenge, but also a forgiving course layout. The scenic views are something out of a movie which as to the relaxation of the game of golf. If you are ever in the area, you have to check out this course.\n\nA big Thank You to the staff there at Cherokee Ridge who were some of the top notch personnel a course can have.

From the moment speaking with Alexis on the phone the conversation quickly became \"what kind of compensation will you give me??\"  Meaning she wanted me to refund over $ 160.00 in greens fees because of her threats of a poor review.   I went out to the course and spoke to the gentlemen about the incident.  They were delayed only 5 minutes from their tee time.  My worker could have had a cooler head dealing with customers, but an apology was made and the men appeared to be happy that I looked into the situation. I offered to buy them a round of beers as a friendly gesture.   I am more than willing to accept a one star review than cower to a person trying to extort money in lieu of a bad review.

Do not sign a contract with Adam\u2019s Acres, and do not trust them. Adam\u2019s Acres has been operating for less than a year. I was the first bride to book Adam\u2019s Acres. I booked them when all that Brittany Adam\u2019s had to show was studs and pictures of what it would look like when completed. I took a huge risk and trusted Brittany. Now, I regret that decision.\n\nDue to the COVID shutdowns in March, I was forced to postpone my April wedding. All of the dates I had to choose from included holiday dates or August dates. We picked August 15th thinking that COVID would be over by then. However, COVID-19 cases are worse now than they were in April. After a lot of praying and talking to relatives, a month from our wedding, we made the decision to postpone our wedding again! This is not at all what we wanted to do, but for the safty of our family and friends we felt it was necessary. Brittany, being the heartless person she is, refused to give us another Friday-Saturday date in 2021. She offered a Sunday date with our rehearsal dinner being on a Thursday. That would not work for religious purposes and the fact that we have so many out of town guests.  She said \u201cwe would cut into her 2021 revenue if she gave us a Friday-Saturday date\u201d. The only way we would be able to have a Friday-Saturday date is to pay the new 2021 rate of $3500.00 when we have already paid in full of $2500.00. Not only will she not let us postpone to a Friday- Saturday date in 2021, she refuses to give us a refund.\n\nShe has stolen our money and has taken advantage of the COVID-19 situation!!

COVID-19 has been a nightmare for everyone and we understand your frustration.\nWhen the State of Alabama shut down all businesses we rescheduled affected couples. It was heartbreaking for our couples and incredibly difficult for our small business that had been operating less than 6 months. We were so happy to have Fall dates still available, but we will be very honest...it has been difficult trying to recover from all the bookings we lost because of reschedules, especially when we didn't qualify for any assistance. We are thankful that unlike a lot of businesses we were able to survive and didn't have to close our doors.\nWhen we rescheduled you to August 14th/15th, we held that date for you and turned away other couples and parties that contacted us for that date. Unfortunately when you cancel 3 weeks prior, it is impossible to re-book.\nWe have been open and safely hosting events again since May 30th. Every single couple has been dealing with the uncertainty of COVID and taking precautions to keep everyone safe. We offered to discuss these options with you as well. The mother of the bride tonight told us, \"I know it wasn't as big as they planned, but they are finally married and we felt SAFE.\" Yesterday\u2019s couple rented additional tables to put outside to further socially distance. All weddings have provided masks and had hand-sanitizer readily available. Tonight's bride also live-streamed her event so that her grandmother (who could not attend because of her assisted-living's COVID policies) could watch her get married. Vendors are wearing masks, caterers are hiring extra staff to safely serve everyone, our venue has extra staff at events for sanitizing... Everyone is making compromises and working hard to keep everyone safe.\nWe are in no way downplaying the seriousness of this virus. We also have no idea when it will end. We understood the reason for your cancellation and although it goes against our cancellation policy, we were empathetic and offered you a Sunday date in 2021 with no additional payments required. When you told us that interfered with your religion, we again offered for a Monday-Thursday. We are so sorry that none of those options worked for you.\nWeddings are such an emotional time for everyone and we understand your disappointment. We know that all couples and wedding vendors alike have been thrown into incredibly difficult situations. When what you want to do for your couples conflicts with how you have to run your business--it feels impossible. If we let one person reschedule, we would have to do it for everyone to be fair. We are so sorry, but we simply cannot do that and keep our doors open. We have to follow our cancellation policy in this situation."}, "gmap_id": "0x889297ef32ece5ff:0xf3bd8bb0f4a416a"}

In this case a reasonable person, in other words,  not a crook, would refund the deposit (full payment of $4000) to my daughter.  The owner, Crooked Brittney Adams,  refused to refund the money.

Only 1 bride out of those 9 affected refused to communicate with us via phone and requested that communication be only between our attorneys. We honored her request. All brides affected were offered comparable Saturday dates and we even offered to extend those date options into 2021 if they still desired a Spring wedding. For those who were in school-- they were offered dates while school was not in session including dates during the Summer, Fall break dates, Winter break dates, and of course Spring 2021. We always try to work with our brides and their families and will continue to offer alternative dates for the 1 bride who has not yet rescheduled.
