A full 2 years of my body aching bone deep, I didn't have the energy to get beyond half a day. I knew my hormones were way out of balance.  I also knew something was more wrong than being a 50yr old menopausal woman who had to live with it.  The program was explained in detail.  Once my lab work came back.  I mean an extensive panel of labs!  The proof was right there in front of me.  The Team at Vital Force tailored a program to fit my needs.  It took about 3 weeks of taking supplements and IV infusion therapy then I noticed a huge change in my self. Each week, I was better than the last.  I HAVE MY LIFE BACK !!  I feel better than I have in years.  If you don't take time to take care of yourself, you body will make you do it !

Not only is Sand a great masseuse, but she is an RN who has taken her medical knowledge, and healing qualities to another level.  Opening Restoration Mind Body and Sole was the best decision she ever made, allowing her to completely immerse her mind and soul into treating and creating life changing treatment options for the patients that walk through  her doors.\n\nYesterday she did a lymphatic massage followed by a foot detox to rid my body of all the toxins hat have accumulated for years .  She did this same detox last week and I was overwhelmed and amazed at the results of that initial treatment and the toxins that were extracted from my body.  I simply couldn\u2019t believe what I saw.  That prompted me booking the massage and another foot detox yesterday.\n\nOne thing I immediately noticed when the detox was through was less pain in my joints, hands, and feet.   I especially noticed less tightness in my hands.  One thing she explained to me is that detox draws out all the toxins and inflammations from throughout the body - especially liver and joints .  Inflammation is the culprit of swelling and pain in arthritis.  I felt so much better all week.\n\nYesterday\u2019s appointment   left me more relaxed and destressed than I\u2019ve been in months.  No tension , aches or stress.  Totally peaceful. These two visits have shown me enough about my body and the things we absorb to make me more conscious of taking care of it and treating it better.   I\u2019m certainly not getting any younger .  I am so impressed with these results, that Ive decided to have the colonic cleanse to completely clean out my system and take better control of my health.\n\nThis is a wonderful place, owned by a wonderful person who clearly loves her patients and what she does to help them stay healthy.   The fact that she is an RN is an extra bonus bc she knows the body so well.\n\nPlease give them a call and book your appointment now!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c93124a2470d1:0x1fde73139a3a9402"}

He takes chiropractor care to levels no one has ever heard of in this town. Let's be real for a moment, almost every who's had pain at some point in their life has gone to a chiropractor for help. The standard way of thinking is that if you could just get that elbow to pop back or to have a hip or shoulder reset then all your pain would go away. But it never works, you might find some mild relief but it's usually short lived by a couple of hours to maybe days and then you wake up and say, you slept wrong and it's out again.\n\nWell the team at Invision chiropractic care will teach you how to do address the underlying problems so you can fix it yourself in the long run. Yes you will get adjusted, yes it will probably hurt (Dr. Aplin has a different approach to adjusting that I've ever seen) but I'm a walking, breathing, significantly less pain and overall stress less person than when I walked into his office 4 months ago.\n\nI'll be honest, I have a long history of surgeries to pains and only walked in to this office cause I didn't want to have another surgery and my dear friend suggested Dr. Aplin. I went when I truly didn't believe he was helping. I went when the pain spread to a neighboring body part. I went even though my TOC doc said I needed surgery to fix my problem. 4 months and I never missed an appointment. I can say today that I don't need surgery, my pain is gone and the results of becoming less stressed and worry free was worth more to me than the pain getting better.\n\nBrainTap. Google it. Dr. Aplin introduced me to it and has changed my life because of it. I feel like I have the answer to a life long question that I know so many of us ask \"How do I feel better?\" yes that's generic but let's be honest, everyone is stressing about something these days. But after 4 months of using the BrainTap and doing my homework from Dr. Aplin, I do feel better, lighter able to take on what the world throws at me. It just works!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581024097197, "text": "Lorren - you're a ROCKSTAR!

Amanda has cared for every member of my family, from my mom, husband, three year old son, and newborn. Amanda is great with kids and my son LOVES visiting \"Dr. Amanda\". He has no clue he is getting adjusted because he is having so much fun with her. When my husbands back locked up the week of Christmas, Amanda worked him in ASAP despite her holiday schedule. Because of his weekly adjustments, my husband is able to run again, which he hasn't been able to do in years because of his back pain. Amanda also cared for me throughout my pregnancy. I give her credit for my easy delivery! After my daughters birth, she adjusted my newborn and it helped with her colic. You could see the relief in her face after an adjustment.\nAmanda's office staff is friendly and she and her staff are constantly going out of their way to provide excellent customer service. Whether it's scheduling an appointment, or needing to bring the kids with me, the staff is always helpful.\nOne thing that stands out about Amanda's chiropractic care which separates her from other chiropractors, is she is always going to seminars and learning the latest techniques. She is very passionate about what she does and wants to provide the best care possible.

Your input is appreciated.\nYour perspective on the first visit is different than most of our patients but significant. The intake paperwork asks the patient to list all their symptoms and quantify their health complaints and instructs the patients to quantify their level of improvement over the next 12 treatments.... That is correct. The reason the paperwork addresses a treatment plan is so patients are aware from the beginning that holistic treatment is not a one treatment panacea, it's not a pill and it's not magic. It is a healing process and the specifics are handled individually with each patient.\nA 20 minutes face to face with a physician is unheard of these days and if you feel that was a short visit so be it. In a 20-minute visit we addressed the entire human frame above and beyond the chief complaint plus acupuncture and tongue analysis. The process didn't stop when you left the office but it continued as the tongue analysis was performed by OUM physicians in California and THERE WERE THREE EMAIL CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFICS. That was a step I take out of true concern for the health and well-being of my patients but it's cases like these that make excellent physicians become callus.\nBest of luck on your journey and next time find something to praise about the next person that gives a damn about your health and well-being"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892927a6c918d1b:0x6fa1927cce21bd5d"}

They truly care about their patients. The thoroughness the whole staff exhibits is also shocking. They make sure everything is covered and you leave without pain. They ask after every session if it was okay. They are helpful, kind, and patient when I am confused or struggling.

The office manager at this business is ABSOLUTELY THE MOST RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL PERSON I HAVE EVER SPOKEN TOO. I came in probably 7 months ago, It was my first visit to ever see a chiropractor, and was in a lot of pain. I paid like $150-$175  that day just because I told them SPECIFICALLY that I did not want a bill in the mail and I would pay whatever that day just to go ahead and get it out of the way. I saw Dr. Jumper and he was very nice and helpful. I thought that I was going to be very pleased with my experience. 6 MONTHS LATER, I received a bill in the mail from them asking me for $35. Soon after I received the bill in the mail I gave them a call to ask some questions about my bill. She began to tell me that I still owed $35 and that the lady that I was working with got fired because of doing stuff like this and not charging me the full amount. I begin to tell her what I paid that day and I asked specifically if I could take care of it the day of the visit. I then asked her if she could just take care of it for me because it was not my mistake it was the employees. Her tone immediately changed and she said \"You still have to pay your bill regardless and if you don't we will be reporting you to collections.\" I tried to explain to her that I am a loyal customer and I just do not think it is right for me to have to pay this and she kept talking over me and raising her voice. THEN, SHE HUNG UP ON ME. Today I receive a phone call from the business and I was on the other line and could not answer, and immediately call back, and no answer. The point of the matter is, IF YOU ARE RUNNING A LOCAL BUSINESS, YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE YOUR CLIENTELE. IF AN EMPLOYEE DOES SOMETHING WRONG, YOU DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED. REGARDLESS. If you are looking for a local chiropractor DO NOT go to this business unless you are wanting to get SCAMMED. It was not the money aspect, but the fact they were not worried about satisfying the customer and doing what is right.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1524498735553, "text": "Erika Berry, we're very sorry to hear about your experience.

Dr. Klein treated my neck and back pain but also took the time to advise me on the most ergonomic set-up for my job to prevent neck and back pain in the future.

If only I'd found him 7 years ago!\n\nOn the wellness side, I have a few medical issues and Dr. Klein has been a tremendous help to me in understanding what the issues mean, what my body may be trying to tell me and what I can do to combat the issue. I've also relied on him for referral advice on physicians because I value his opinion and trust his judgment.\n\nLakeCrest Chiropractic is certainly a place you can expect quality care and not fear being placed through a series of expensive tests just for the sake of making money. Dr. Klein has proven to me time and time again that he is in this business to HELP people. I highly recommend LakeCrest Chiropractic.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481747555965, "text": "Thank you, DeAnna!

We are a small family business who strives to treat our patients like family, with the upmost care and respect. We have seen amazing results through chiropractic for many of our patients, but it is very true that if we feel something else might benefit them to achieve their healthcare goals (like orthotic inserts, physical therapy, or referring to a medical specialist), we will encourage our patients to seek those treatment options. We wholeheartedly believe in chiropractic care, but we also believe that it isn't the answer for every case that comes in our office---which is why we often recommend orthotic inserts, etc. We do not sell nor are we affiliated with any sort of orthotic insert, we have just seen so many patients respond really well (especially folks whom are quite active or on their feet all day) to shoe inserts which is why we will often recommend folks to try them out \u2014 so sorry if we ever came off as pushy, it was never our intention.

Dr. Klein, his wife and office manager, Amanda, and the massage therapist, Crystal, are the most compassionate as well as professional people I have ever met.

Crystal is a miracle worker as a massage therapist and I always feel better when I leave her services. Dr. Klein is the absolute best chiropractor I have ever worked with and his treatment plans are progressive with the intent on bring you to maintenance- not draining your wallet.

Was told that my pelvis was tilted one way on one side and a different way on the other, subluxations were present in several places, and my kneecaps were not in the proper place. Realizing this treatment plan was going to be a sizeable investment both in time and money I decided to seek out a second opinion. (Honestly, felt kind of like I was at a cattle call with the first guy.) This is how I met Dr. Drew. His diagnosis jived with the first one, but his approach was so much better! First of all, he did not want to do duplicate XRays. He tried to save me money and exposure to radiation by having by having me pick up my first set of XRays from the other place. Secondly, he was quick to say that he did not work miracles but did believe he could help me. His estimation of treatments required was fewer than the other guy, but we were still in for months of multiple treatments per week. I gladly started treatment immediately.\n\nAfter about 3 weeks Dr. Drew advised that I was not getting the kind of relief he expected and ordered an MRI. Kind of freaked me out and I tried bargaining with him explaining that I had actually not been resting and icing like he recommended. He was supremely patient and convinced me to have the MRI. The test showed that I had a congenital condition called Diastematomyelia which had never been diagnosed. My spinal cord was split and tethered. Apparently the condition is rare and we began a frantic search for a neurosurgeon who had actually performed the surgery before. Dr. Drew was with me every step, answering questions, sending referrals, and calming my nerves. This condition left untreated could eventually have caused more loss of strength and coordination, incontinence, and paralysis.\n\nToday I am 3 weeks post op. 2 surgeons operated on me for 8 hours. All signs as of now indicate that the surgery was a complete success. Dr. Drew, through his unwavering commitment to patient care, got this journey started and I owe him a debt of gratitude. The only argument that I have with him is that I believe he is a miracle worker in getting this condition diagnosed.\n\nbtw - Mel is awesome and keeps the office running like a well oiled machine!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481747609736, "text": "Thank you, Ms. Rhonda!
