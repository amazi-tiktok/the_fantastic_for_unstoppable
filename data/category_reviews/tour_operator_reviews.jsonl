Michelle follows in the footsteps of thousands of great African Americans in Montgomery who fought for equity, justice and self-determination. On her tour and in person, she's every bit as funny, passionate and incisive as her TED talk. We learned a ton about who she is, and why this tour is so important to her: she's run for office three times, she's related to the famous Browder U.S. civil rights court case, she's involved in running youth programs for the community, and she comes from a background of justice organizing and political activism.\n\nThe tour itself does a great job of highlighting recent civil rights wins in Montgomery, but also tells the hidden stories and secret histories that aren't visible or celebrated in the city. Michelle customized the tour once she heard we were particularly interested in learning more about Indigenous history and criminal justice reform, plus she tailored her stories to connect our experiences with the Montgomery reality.  Overall, we were so thrilled with this tour and we told all of our friends about it.

I booked a flight for my wife's birthday, but it had to be rescheduled due to weather. TN Balloon doesn't control the weather, and like Logan said this morning while we were soaring over Williamson County, \"I'd rather be on the ground wishing I was in the air than in the air wishing I was on the ground.\" The entire crew works hard to ensure your ballooning adventure is a great memory for a lifetime, so we were happy to reschedule. This morning we arrived at the meeting point and were whisked away to a launch site. When the balloon was ready, we took off just in time to see the sunrise over the horizon. Floating over Williamson County was an amazing experience that our pilot Logan made seem effortless. He explained the theory & science of balloon flight, the controls, and what to expect with an easy professionalism. The entire flight was something that we'll remember forever, and experiencing what seemed like a precision touchdown was awesome.\nIf you've always wanted to float above the earth while hearing everything below you and around you, then I highly recommend TN Balloon.

Bart & I do our best to provide you with a fun and informative cruise. It\u2019s so kind of you to remind others to bring tip money, and we do appreciate the gratuity.\nPlease come back to cruise with us again and try a Blue Angels or a Snorkel excursion, or just another dolphin cruise- as every cruise every day is totally different. We spot different dolphin on different days. \ud83d\udc2c My southern accent must have been extra thick that day. We don\u2019t have a deck hand named Tammy, but we do have me- I am Tabby and I appreciate you taking the time to give us a good review.\n\nUntil we meet again, kind regards,\n\nTabby & Capt. Bart"}, "gmap_id": "0x8890a80e22f552af:0x2493a14e64598a8a"}

There has never been a day that we don\u2019t bring forth our \u201cA\u201d game, and put aside any personal issues we might have- including the death of a loved one.\nI\u2019m sorry for what you went through on someone\u2019s boat, but I am confident it wasn\u2019t mine.\nAnd as far as checking for payment....if you cruised with someone without paying...shame on you.\nWe all (all dolphin cruises) work very hard and occasionally, due to most customers paying online prior to the cruise, and no need to \u201ccheck for payment\u201d, we/any cruise company miss collecting and if you did not speak up, SHAME one you. What are you trying to accomplish by announcing that on a public forum?\nAre you encouraging others to stiff us too? Wow. That speaks volumes.\nP.S.\nThere is another company in town who copied my business model, and had a very similar name as me.
