He diagnosed the problem in about a minute, and started repairing it himself right on the spot.\n\nIn less than 30 minutes, he had it fixed as new. Then, when I offered to go settle the bill in the office, he refused to take any payment for his efforts.

I took my Toyota Tacoma truck by to have them add the electrical plug for my trailer hitch. They went over it and said there were two types.

They apologized and said they would be glad to get the right one if I would allow them. While they were evaluating it though, they discovered that the trailer hitch was not properly mounted. I watched them fix it, and they didn\u2019t charge me for fixing it. They installed the right one the next day and I was very satisfied.
