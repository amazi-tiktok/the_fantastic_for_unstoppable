On Dec 8 2020 Dr. Bonazt entered the room and began talking with the door of the room wide open. I asked if he could close the door while we discussed my injury. His response no because of COVID-19 a violation of my patients rights mind you Dr. Bonazt was not wearing a mask nor gloves so much for concerns. Also, while waiting on him the door was closed the entire time and anyone else that entered closed the door behind them. He ask me what my job title was twice which I\u2019m sure was on my report. He indicated that the fracture was healing pretty good I didn\u2019t need surgery and therefore there was nothing else he could do. I question him because I must be 100% my strength in my hand indicated that I could hold up to13lbs briefly. I asked him for copies of the report he denied me of that also, stating that workman\u2019s comp would have to request it. Forgetting when I visit him the first time he did.

Never in my life have I experienced such harsh treatment from a doctor! Even my first visit with him was horrible! As I attempted to explain my situation to Dr. Rachael he gazed at the wall as If I bored him and even when it seemed as if I had his attention he gave off a very nonchalant attitude. My second visit I left crying because he screamed at me so bad as if I was lying and made my injury up just to get paid under workers comp because he ordered a carpal tunnel test that came back positive be he explained to me the Dr. was wrong who performed the test and that half the people in the lobby would come back positive for carpal tunnel even though they don't have it. My thoughts was why would you test me for carpal tunnel which would include the middle finger, the pointer finger and the thumb only when I have clearly from day one told you my pinky finger and ring finger are numb and painful which would be cubital tunnel. So for his mistake I was scolded like a toddler. He then ordered an MRI which came back schowing a tear in my right wrist on my tfc disk and on top of that an ganglion cyst 16mm by 6 mm that has grown inside my inner wrist.

Visited at the recommendation of my physical therapist for a shoulder issue. When I got to the lobby I could tell this place is set up for mass production: there were check-in kiosks like at the airport and a bunch of people waiting. When I was called the first time, it was to pay. When I was called the second time, I was led to a second  waiting room with no explanation. The third time I was led to an x-ray room where I found out I was getting x-rays. Surprise! Eventually, I was led to an examination room. No vitals were taken. I waited. Eventually, a doctor - not the one I had the appointment with - showed up and immediately started to discuss scheduling surgery without examination. He discussed two procedures - the second one was news to me. When I inquired, he then tested my range of motion to confirm what he had seen in the tests. I expressed doubts about the second procedure and he left to get the originally-scheduled doctor. After nearly 30 minutes, they both came back. The second (scheduled) doctor explained why he recommended the second procedure as a preemptive option. He did a good job of explaining the surgery and recovery. He left and the first doctor took me to a scheduler. Everyone I interacted with was cordial and professional. I never saw my x-rays nor the MRI I had brought with me. I realize this place is good and they have a lot of people to get to. I known they are all fine surgeons. But still, I felt like one more item to check off on their to-do list. I still have unanswered  questions and it is ironic that being there for 2.5 hours and waiting most of the time, that I felt rushed when it came to the consultation. In summary, one of the best places for surgery, but don't expect \"the personal touch.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1576603498313, "text": "Thank you for your candid response.

I was without pain, discharged, and went home the same day. Ten days after surgery I drove non-stop from Meridian, Mississippi to San Antonio, Texas. Last July he performed Lumbar Laminectomy surgery and removed the debris and spurs that were causing numbness in both legs and prohibited me from standing up straight. Again, discharged the same day, feeling returned to both legs and walking as the Good Lord intended.  There is not another Doctor on the planet I would allow to cut on my spine than Dr. Nichols.\n\nHis professionalism exemplifies what Andrews Sports Medicine stands for.  My family and I were always given  the same care and concern as the professional athletes they have become famous for treating. Simple logic dictates that if world class professional athletes with unlimited resources, who depend on their bodies performing at the level they do, seek out his services, it must be top notch.

I have suffered much pain from the tendons in in my joints. Mainly trigger fingers, where they lock down and become too painful to pull back up. Therefore, becoming useless for everyday life. Thankfully I was referred to Dr. McKeon.\n\nMy first encounter with this awesome lady was with my grandson, whose thumb kept dislocating. Dr. McKeon suggested we wait and allow growth  plates to grow properly, with hopes that he would outgrow it. He indeed has outgrown the condition. Although Dr. McKeon wasn\u2019t the first to operate on these lock downs, she is my choice every time.\n\nMy last surgery was at the Birmingham Surgery Center, in Homewood. I often describe it, as much like going to a dental appointment. Dr. McKeon is always so friendly and full of joy. I\u2019m positive she\u2019s human and occasionally has a, not so good day, but you would never know it, when she appears. During surgery she and I had a question and answer session during the surgical procedure. Her coworkers seem to adore her also.\n\nIn conclusion, if you\u2019re looking for a 5 star doctor for your hands, and awesome bedside manner is of importance to you, Dr. McKeon is your woman.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1623676257377, "text": "Thank you for your kind words, and for taking the time to share your experience."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9def617db:0x851470cf93fea328"}

She diagnosed me with carpal tunnel which was confirmed by a nerve conduction test. At the first visit she wanted to give me a steroid injection but I told her because of health issues my Rheumatologist recommended I not take them. She said it was a local injection and not systemic but I reiterated I could not do it. She was very annoyed I would not get the injection. When I asked her what else I could do for the pain she said there was nothing else I could do for it. I did my own research and started getting massages, acupuncture, and did essential oils. I went back for a second visit and she was nicer and seemed a little more concerned about me since I was still in so much pain. At this point the pain had started shooting up my arm. She said to try hand therapy for a couple of weeks and if that didn't help we could discuss surgery. I did therapy which still did not improve my condition and went back to her for a third visit. This time Dr. McKeon flat out refused to discuss surgery. She dismissed all the notes the hand therapist had sent her and told me she felt like I had mild carpal tunnel and the pain I was having was caused by the hand brace I had been wearing and it was a completely different nerve causing the pain. The pain had not changed and the brace actually made it more tolerable. She told me to stop wearing the brace during the day and only wear it while I slept. She then gave me two doctors' names if I wanted a second opinion. At this point I was crying because I was so frustrated she was not willing to discuss surgery. I did go for a independent second opinion but not to the doctors she recommended. I have an anesthesiologist friend who recommended a hand orthopedist he worked with. I was able to get in to see that orthopedist the next day. This doctor was the total opposite of Dr. McKeon. He listened to me and had compassion for the pain I had been living with for months. He said I had tried all other measures and at this point surgery was the best option to get rid of the pain. I had carpal tunnel release surgery the next week. It is a very simple out patient surgery that takes about 15 minutes. When I woke up from the surgery 100% of the pain, numbness, and tingling was gone. I wished I had gone to the second doctor months before I did but was willing to give Dr. McKeon a chance when she said we could discuss surgery if I did the therapy and that didn't help.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9def617db:0x851470cf93fea328"}
