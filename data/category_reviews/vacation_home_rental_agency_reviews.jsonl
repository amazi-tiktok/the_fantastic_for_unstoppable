We had five retired couples staying on the east side of the duplex.

If the pool is used with the new heater, there is another charge.  There are no chairs to take to the beach or beach \"stuff\", but they do have a local rental agency that is accommodating, but an added expense.  I rented 10 beach lounge chairs and 5 umbrellas for 2 days for $222.\n\nTwenty young professionals rented the other side of the duplex, as there was a music festival in town.   We heard them, mainly on the main level through the locked adjoining door, but they were really nice and friendly, so it didn't bother us.\n\nI would have given the Endurance II 5 stars, except that some towel bars were broken, a couple of lights were out, the pots and pans were merely adequate, a burner on the stove needed maintenance, the furniture in the main sitting area was quite dated and limited for the number of bedrooms, and the dining table needed a few more chairs.  There is a small coffee pot, but I brought my Keurig to use, as there were 10 of us.  Do know that there is very minimal supplies in the house, so renters will need to go to the store to buy what they need or bring it from home.\n\nEven with the minimal minor problems, we would happily rent the house again.

Long rant, but the bottom portion is where the issue starts.  We booked this place on 11/7/20 and on 11/20/20 I received a phone call stating that the elevator was malfunctioning and the part would not be in until after my stay.  I was told they would be refunding my money and they apologized for the inconvenience.  My stay was supposed to start on 11/25 so this was fairly inconvenient as we had numerous people in my group booked at other locations nearby.  I received a follow on call a few minutes later stating that I bought insurance and they could not refund me and that I had to go through the insurance for the refund.  After receiving an email, I called them back and questioned that since they cancelled my trip, was I going to be entitled a refund on my insurance money as well.  Terri said \u201cyes.\u201d  The insurance refused my claim as it did not meet their criteria so I contacted Terri again at Luna Beach and explained the situation.  They quickly executed a partial refund (all the money minus the insurance).  This is where the customer service and professionalism goes down the drain.  I spoke with Terri that night and questioned why I didn\u2019t receive the money for the insurance I paid.

She did not give me an option to stay there as she said she was going to cancel my stay and that I would have to find another place.  I would of gladly stayed at this location and took the stairs due to having to find a place away from others that already had bookings in the area.

When we got there to check in, we found out that we had to pay additional fees for any vehicles. Not a single one was included in the booking cost. Not even 24 hours in we had problems with the room keys not wanting to let us in. Some times it would blink red, sometimes it didnt register at all. We had to go to the office 4/5 times to fix the issue. Finally they replaced the batteries in the main lock. The office staff was rude, pissy, and didnt have much interested in helping their guest. Lastly, upon leaving, we did the courteous thing by sweeping majority of the tracked in sand up,  wiped down counters, made sure all dishes had been ran and washed, and so forth. Left, turned out keys in. And headed home. Today May 31st we are charged $110!! after speaking with someone at anchor, who didnt know why, she contacted the condo then gave us a call.

Mind you we have small children in this room under the age of 5!!!!! Not once was a cigarette brought into that room and we are extremely disappointed with the way this is going. Might I add we were also charged another $40 for them to wash the comforter! The cleaning policy clearly says fresh linens are included and any additional cleaning will be extra.

I requested 1 night be reimbursed out of the 7 that we stayed - then after two more emails they never responded.  And apparently this is regarded as a threat by them.\n\nWe arrived and the first thing we noticed is the washer door is open and about 1 foot full of filthy dark brown water. We called and got somebody trying to fix it but was unsuccessful. Repair man was great but stated they have been unable to fix washer over past weeks. I left to go to the beach and let him do his work. After 2 days of not hearing anything back I had to call office and ask about what they were going to do about the water. Somebody came to drain it. After a couple more days of not hearing about repair status I asked and they said it's unfixable.\n\nThe troublesome part about the washer is they knew it was having issues for weeks and never notified us we would be unable to do laundry. A family of 4 on a beach vacation needs this. I would have found another option. The attitude was consistently like we were a burden and it's no big deal to not have a washer. I'm on vacation and last thing I want to do is spend hours at the laundromat - but apparently that's only worth $30 of trouble.\n\nAdditionally there was never anything in the ad about the washer being broken.  Only after my numerous complaints did Gulfsands update their descriptions to say washer did not work.  If you look at other reviews online apparently this has been an issue for months.\n\nAlso we found two huge dead cockroaches each about 2.5 inches long. I guess this was the result of the exterminators that arrived unannounced to apply poison in our condo. Between the washer and the exterminator we had 3 visits from maintenance personnel while we are trying to relax on vacation.\n\nAlso 2 of the 3 TVs were unable to connect to the Wi-Fi. Not a big deal on beach vacation but worth mentioning. Cable doesn't work in 1 bedroom too.\n\nAlso even though Covid restrictions are lifted, Gulfsands is still doing a \"remote\" check in that is cumbersome. It feels like they are using the situation as an excuse to not have to interact with people. The office you pick your keys up at resembles a maximum security prison with all the cameras and just seems over the top.\n\nPositives were tons of hot water, good location across from Waves (groceries, beer, ice, fishing, etc), and normally an OK value if these problems would have been resolved. Condo is certainly dated.\n\nOverall I can't recommend based on my experiences with how the company is managed and the troubles I described with the condo.\n\n*Update*  I think all you need to do is read the response from the owner below to validate they are unreasonable and probably not worth your business :)", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625955081226, "text": "Please disregard this review.  This was a guest who threatened us with reviews if we did not pay them a free night for their washer being out of service.  This is a $30 credit item, which is the highest to any guest, as most were $10.  This is for groups of 6.  The guest told staff to 'keep it', as we learned after departure that they wanted more than $200.  This is called post exit rental extortion and is common in the market, especially this year.  We did confirm with the guest that if we didn't pay that amount, he would go on web sites to write negative reviews?  As you can see, this is the result.  The other issues appeared only after the request for money, which is also how this game works.  We don't play, as most other agents have stopped as well.  BTW, a large bug as described is a palmetto bug, and it is not from the condo, as it simply walked in an open door to escape the heat.  That's where they come from, outside.  We wish the guest the best, and hope they enjoy our beaches another time.  The water in the washer was soapy, and emptied as soon as requested, as we had to purchase a pump.  We also treated unit with bleach so it smelled clean.  Pest control comes once every 90 days, and not to poison their condo, but to treat pests, as with every condo in the city.  The new washer was on order, and was noted as not functioning in the rental ad since March 2021.  A new timer was installed for the prior guest to gain some life from the unit, and the unit was working for them, then failed again, as we waited several weeks for the new washer to arrive, which it since has.  Stack units were in high demand due to damages from Hurricane Sally and new construction, so they were not available from any source.  We had to wait weeks for it, but compensated each guest fairly.  This is a review done to intentionally hurt us for non payment of an amount that was not going to happen."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

Very prompt response and courteous on the phone. The day we arrived we did a walk through and noticed hair on the floor in the bathroom inside the master bedroom, and there was a strong odor of urine. After raising the toilet seat cover we noticed there was urine on the seat, the rim, and the back of the toilet. We went to the store and bought some cleaner to clean up the mess but could not get the urine smell to dissipate so we closed the door and only used the hall bathroom. It seemed the previous renters had left various children's toys and McDonalds cups in the condo as well. While this wasn't really an issue it made for a disorganized appearance. The A/C was cold, the water was hot, and the view was perfect. I believe your cleaning contractor leaves a lot to be desired and could do a much better job. Knowing that you have various people renting, as a condo owner I would suggest purchasing matching dinner and flatware as well as all cookware. While the appliances were all in working order the dishwasher and washer/dryer were very dated and the stove elements were crooked and awkward to cook on. We absolutely loved the leather/vinyl couch and strongly recommend getting away from fabric furniture unless it is professionally cleaned. I understand the costs of owning beachfront property to be quite expensive, but for the price it could use some updating. You could utilize the cleaning company to check inventory of everything on the day of checkout and charge the renter for anything missing or broken items. Also I strongly encourage you to purchase darkout curtains for the master bedroom as the outside lights and early sunrise made it very cumbersome to sleep. The only reason this got 4 stars was due to the nastiness of the room. We would definitely give this company and owner another chance in the future because we love Gulf Shores and it is our favorite vacation destination so we will be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

Although the accommodations were sufficient, they were not as advertised. To begin, we were under the assumption, based on the listing descriptions, that our condo 1202 was penthouse level. Upon arrival we were the last floor before penthouse, but the view was amazing.\n\nThis condo is listed to sleep 6 people. The accommodations read king size bed, sofa sleeper and two bunk beds. Specifications should have said children size bunks. The fold out still had plastic on the mattress and sounded like sleeping in a bag of potato chips.  The couch was more comfortable to sleep on as a sofa.\n\nThe first two showers that were taken in the hall bathroom were ice cold, as turning the knob to H made the water remain cold leading us to believe the hot water heater was broken. Upon calling Gulfsands Rental, we were informed that the hot/cold was reversed, meaning H was cold and C was hot. The exact words of the agent were, \"Oh, that is reversed, try keeping the knob on cold.\" There was nothing posted to this affect in the bathroom, even though this as a known issue by the rental company.\n\nIn the master bedroom, the ceiling fan was not working. When calling the rental company they stated it worked only with a remote of which there was not one. A maintenance request was put in. When the guy showed up to look at it he said the motor was blown and he would have to either order a new part or a new fan. It was not fixed during our 5 night stay. We called on day one about the fan.\n\nOther minor issues were the floor was not clean when we arrived, the wifi connection was unreliable and when eating, the only place for multiple people to eat was on the balcony, 3 deep on the soft or perched on the most uncomfortable bar stools ever created.\n\nTo sum up the review, the rental company should have been more forthcoming about known issues prior to booking. We feel we did not get what we paid for. I\n\nI tried to post this on their website, but all reviews are moderated by them so the likelihood of it being seen on their website is slim to none.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1437582936168, "text": "We regret this review, as the guest was looking at unit 1306 initially, but that unit was not available...penthouse level 1306...and 1202 was and offered with a link to view this unit.  This unit is not, and has never been noted as penthouse level, this was a guest mistake.  Unit 1202 is one level below the penthouse level and 12th floor is no different otherwise.  Nothing special is available on the penthouse floor.  Bunks are photo'd online and ARE described for children.  Sounds like the stay was very good, but not indicated as such.  The shower is actually correct, but we have found the simplest way to note how it works to the guests that have issues is to say its reversed.  There is an arrow on the rounded side of shower arm pointing to the H and C, but most folks miss it, so they assume the arm is to point to H or C.  We regret the issue, but it's just how it was manufactured.  The stools are brand new and heavy duty.  Don't know what else we can say.  This is a wonderful, updated condo with a great view.  We did report the fan not working to the owner, and he is fedexing his replacement for arrival today, as they are special units.  Light worked, and the AC makes the unit very cold, but one fan did not turn during the stay, and we did everything we could to repair it.  We received a 2 star review.  We view this review as inappropriate, as we have great deals and this is a very nice condo.  We feel reviews like this have no place on the web, but they have become commonplace as people will go out of their way to damage a company's reputation with little issue, but the thousands of happy guest won't take the time to note the great time they had.

Our policy is provided up front in our rental agreement and also on our Policies page on our web site to keep folks informed.  Card policies in the accommodations industry continually change and have become quite strict.  We follow all Visa, MC, AMEX and Discover policies as they protect both you and the condo owner.  We did offer the option of sending checks from multiple parties, since we can only accept CC payment from the person signing the agreement, and you did send checks from 2 different parties for payment.  We hope that helped.  With check in, our policy is the same as a hotel, and only the person on the reservation can check in.  We can add an additional tenant prior to check in, but they need to sign an agreement and also have a card on file.  Please know that our goal is to make your stay enjoyable, but we do note our policies up front and have to abide by them."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

However, the studio you mentioned left this review on our website after their stay:\n\n\"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with this condo. We had originally booked a different condo that was closer to the Hangout Festival. There was a problem with the owners of that condo, and we were moved to this one. I was a bit upset because we were staying with another couple, and we were now sharing a studio apartment. There was ZERO privacy. It would be a great condo for just one couple or a small family, though. I also have to say that Bender was very sweet about it, and refunded me some of my money for the inconvenience.  I was also scared when I saw the pictures of the place. The pictures DEFINITELY need to be updated. It looks much better in person. It is very very clean, but it needs to be updated. There is no dishwasher, which was a bit of a pain. Also all of the dishes were ceramic and glass, which were not allowed at the pool or anything- I'd recommend bringing some plastic cups and paper plates. The location was AMAZING. Right on the beach. I really enjoyed the patio in the mornings. The pool was lovely, and the beach was perfection. If you are renting this place for Hangout Fest, know that this is quite the walk! We were told it was a mile away but it was actually  1.4 miles, which means that its about a 3 mile walk every day. So be prepared! Overall our stay was much better than expected, but the condo could use some updating and it was a little further than I had hoped for.

We hope that you escaped the bad weather over the last few months with little to no damage. Our hearts hurt seeing the devastation around the community. We're looking forward to planning our next vacation.\n\nOn a happier note, I'd like to share our experience with the rest of the Google Community.\n\nEveryone, in all 6 of our families, enjoyed our stay at Erica's Sandpiper during the 1st week of August 2020, during Covid-19. The experience was beyond what we imagined when we first started our family vacation planning. We can tell that there is a lot of love surrounding this house.\nAlthough we didn't use many of the extra gadgets available, we did notice the variety and how well kept these items were. I was shocked to see the sparkling new utensils in the drawer. I certainly didn't expect to find that in a beach house.  The 2 refrigerators were definitely a necessity. They got filled up within the 1st hour we were there. The 2 dining rooms made it very comfortable for everyone to enjoy their meals.\n\nWe loved having the pool option with chairs and tables under the house. It was the perfect size for our family and the depth of the pool allowed us to sit back and relax when the kids took over. The outside shower was a fabulous idea. I looked forward to that after leaving the beach and realized I was carrying half of the ocean's sand back to the house with me. \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe unlimited access to the beach with only our family surrounding us was definitely an added bonus. We didn't have to \"fight\" with others over space. I don't think we'll ever be able to return to another beach after being spoiled with our private area.\nI found it interesting to see who the pool lovers and beach lovers were. Being able to go between the two gave everyone lots to do throughout the day.\n\nMany of us took advantage of the deck. So many different things to see: dolphins, family members swimming, waves crashing, sunrise and sunset, special red colored moons and lots of stars. Some of looked forward to just sitting out there for some quiet time at different times of the day. Very relaxing.\n\nWe were able to purchase 2 charcoal grills at $20 each from Walmart, which allowed us to have our BBQ style family dinners. My sister also cooked pizzas on the grills!!!\n\nThe house was the perfect size for our family. There was plenty of room to just walk around on the inside and for the kids to travel around to visit different family members in different rooms. I never felt smothered even at full capacity. We used every room and enjoyed all of the televisions.\nHaving a bathroom in EVERY room was a life saver. Such a marvelous idea!!! The fans in the room were greatly appreciated as well as allowing us to control the temperature in both sections of the house. We learned who the hot bodied and freezing bodied people were very quickly.\nWe had the chance to chat with the neighbors. They were extremely nice. In fact, we found that most of our experiences with visitors and locals were very pleasant. Prior to our departure, we had a very special delivery from Erica's Sandpiper's owner, CHEESECAKE!!! What a very kind gesture and a nice surprise.\n\nI know we all would love to visit Erica's Sandpiper again or venture to one of your other houses. We'll definitely consider returning on our next visit to the Gulf Shores. Thank you for allowing us to make memories in your lovely home!\n\nSincerely,\nJ.

The few times I had any issues, like a small incident with the city dumping tree trimmings where I would park, he was super responsive and helpful in resolving the issue almost immediately.\n\nThe house itself was great and the location was super convenient.  It was a less than 10 minute drive to downtown, grocery stores, and the mall by exit ten, but also a quiet enough neighborhood that I could feel at home at the end of my day.  It was also a two block walk to Lakebottom Park, which really can't be beat.\n\nProbably the best part of my experience with renting from Dave though, was that he is 100% serious about looking out for people who have rented from him.  While moving to a new duty station, I contacted him asking if he wouldn't mind being a reference on a lease application.

First things first go ahead and save yourself from endearing a horrible experience.\n\nI booked this room for my soon to be wife\u2019s company\u2019s brand rep photo shoot. We checked in and we all bought parking passes and everything they required. Got to the room and boom right off the bat the pullout bed was completely broken, the ice make was making loud sounds and did not produce one ice cube, the screen door was hanging by a tread about to fall off the balcony. I messaged them about theses things the day we got here and did not get a reply!\n\nWell things got worse. We had an extra girl coming and she got here a few nights after our first nights stay. She arrived at 1 in the morning the guard waved her through so she parked and slept until they had to be at a photo shoot early in the morning at sea side (3 hours away) well before she got back here car had a boot on it and two tickets. No warnings just two tickets and a boot. Less then 20 hours and boom they hit her with this and a $250 fine. We talked to the mannager the next day and he was rude and could careless. Had the guard been doing his job and actually checked to see if she had a parking pass non of this would of happened!\n\nThis entire say was a big bust and couldn\u2019t of gotten any worse!\n\nFind a place that wants you to stay there and that will treat you with respect and not be rude and ruthless about the parking situation I mean I understand why they have to be strict but right now with COVID-19 going on there\u2019s tones of empty parking spots and they were not hurting on parking spots!\n\nVery dissatisfied will not recommend this to anyone.

The apartment itself was nice, despite the large bloodstain upon the guest bedroom duvet cover upon arrival, which the owner later accused us of causing. . The residents of the complex did not hold back in unleashing their full \"Karen\", and we were falsely accused numerous times by residents of the complex for \"infractions\", such as not cleaning up after our dogs- which was false and not supported by any evidence (we are very conscious of the need to pick up after our pets!!) This, along with a slew of other false accusations, resulted in nightly visits from security coming to our apartment to scold my parents (who are in their mid-60s) and I as if we were school children, putting a major damper on our evenings.  Whereas the security guards themselves were generally friendly, we felt as if we were unwelcome and being \u201cwatched\u201d. We were also accused of not having \u201cregistered\u201d one of the dogs, again untrue as they eventually admitted.\n\nLastly, and this may not be as important for some people, but the Wi-Fi network that is offered to guests is not secured. For people who work remotely with sensitive data, this did not provide an accommodating environment. Hours after we left the Phoenix, I realized that my Amazon account had been hacked- I am inclined to believe that this was a result of being forced to access an unsecured network.\n\nAfter our departure the owner contacted us to complain about the apartment. Her claim was that our dirty sheets were not clean enough. Yes, you read that correctly. She also complained about other minor matters that were well within the bounds of normal everyday use. Next time we will make sure to take photos on departure.\n\nAs a residence that claims to be \"dog friendly\" it certainly is not in our opinion a welcoming place for larger dogs (over 40 pounds). We were constantly harassed and accused of things which we could prove we were not responsible for. Thankfully we were able to get away to the beach for a couple of days and enjoy the beautiful Orange Beach scenery and weather. If you are looking for a fun, relaxing and dog-friendly environment, this is not the place for you!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a079383d8dafb:0x2b9750baf75e249e"}

I wondered if the beds were not completely made up and finished because there were no comforters on the beds. We found They were in the closets. There was only a thin blanket on each bed. The Full size  mattresses could stand updating. They were a little thin and not as comfortable. The knob to the dryer was broken.  I had a hard time turning it on without plyars. I found out at the end of the week that the part had been ordered. It would have been nice if they could have left some tool for me to use to turn the dryer on and to leave a note explaining they were sorry and the part had been ordered. The air conditioner began leaking all over the floor. We called and the maintenance came to fix it. Hopefully for the next guest it will remain fixed. The owners need to update the tv. We rarely could get the remote to work. I had to call maintenance and they came several hours later saying it was fixed. I still had trouble with it.

Jerry actually said that we were supposed to call the property owner/management to fix those type of issues. Even though this was not Jerry's job to fix the TV's, he said that he would be right down. Jerry took the time out of his schedule to immediately make sure that we were taken care of and he came right away and ensured all the tv's were on and hooked up properly. A big Thank you to JERRY with security from Kim, Janice, Terri and JoAnn for your support during our stay.  The experience there was great, people were very friendly all of the security team were friendly and we never met a stranger no matter where we went.

The second instance a family near us was scolded for playing audible music around the pool and for having snacks by their pool chairs. Third we had a family member have their bracelet break overnight and the front desk security guard jokingly wanted 80 dollars and bargained with me for 50 bucks before realizing it wasn't funny and offering a new one for 5 dollars. Final straw was when our family staying at the next door phoenix property were told to buy a wrist band or leave when visiting our property's pool. We verified this was ok ahead of booking, but we're lied to.

Adults were throwing empty beer cans from the lazy river into the kiddie pool area and slinging beer everywhere, cussing, flipping off the security guard, Quinton, who was doing his best, blocking the lazy river, and handing out shots in the lazy river. Tons of children and families were there, but no respect was given to their needs at all. My child felt very uncomfortable in the environment and hated having to go to the part of the lazy river where the \"drunk adults\" we're congregated.\n\nAt no time did the pool cleaning lady or the homeowners association lady come to stop any of that. Other moms were having to take their children to the small indoor pool to get away from the \"GD\" word. We will NEVER vacation here again. If you are looking to book here because of the slide and lazy river which children should be able to use, go somewhere else. This is NOT an appropriate environment for children or relaxation. We felt like we were in the middle of Mardi Gras weekend swimming in a lazy river of urine because these adults just pull their coolers up to the side and stand in it drinking all day.\n\nWe were made to move from a chair at 8:00am where we had coffee and a book and were not disturbing anyone with loud music or language or obstructing anyone's way...but endured terrible and obscene behavior the rest of our time.

The bath towels are old. The microwave has broken plastic, the dishwasher leaks. The couches are so old and worn, the arm rests are discolored. The carpet wasn\u2019t vacuumed, the tile in the kitchen has broken pieces with some grout missing.\n\nDavid Cohen came and tried to vacuum right under foot with all our kids here. Wasn\u2019t interested in seeing the issues. He was suppose to come the next day and clean while we were out, didn\u2019t show up. I hope they refund us some money at least for the cleaning fee.

We were not given a time frame, just said that we would get a text when it was ready.  An hour later we received the text that the condo was ready.  I was aggravated at first then realized how long it would take to clean that condo once we got in.  I would suggest moving check in to 4:00 p.m.  I did really like that we only needed a code to get in and checked in directly at the condo. We stayed at Blue Water (1504).  It had an amazing view.  Everything we needed to cook.  The kitchen was fully stocked.  All of the beds were comfortable and the condo was clean.  Convenient shopping and grocery very close by.

We always want to make sure we are doing our best to take care of each guest that books with Liquid Life. We are aware of the reservation you are speaking of although you are not listed as the primary renter. On the day before this reservation was due to arrive for check-in, our office received a phone call that the guests would not be arriving and would like to move their dates or cancel the reservation. Even though the guest did not purchase travel insurance (which is what helps protect guests financially in situations such as this,) we did offer to move dates for the reservation anyway. Unfortunately, the original condo booked was not open for the new dates, and you (or your primary renter) were offered another condo at the same complex. The future dates were in the peak season of July, which resulted in a higher nightly cost for the stay. The reservations team explained they could move dates, but the guest would be responsible for the difference in price. This was a special offer made to the guest, given the circumstances. The guest did not want to pay the difference, so the reservations team said they could cancel the reservation and try to re-book the condo. If the condo re-booked, Liquid Life would refund the guest for the rent. This was the only other option since travel insurance was not purchased and the guest did not want to pay the price difference. The condo did not rebook with such short notice, but Liquid Life refunded all fees but the rent in order to give back as much as we could to the guest. We understand that once the condo didn\u2019t re-book, and that\u2019s disappointing. Our customer service manager went back and listened to the original calls to make sure all the options were explained very clearly to the guest. We were, in no way, trying to keep money from the guest. Our team was trying to offer any options we could to the guest given the circumstances. We hope that you understand the situation more clearly now. We would have loved to welcome you to the beach and tried our best to do so.

Lastly be sure your rental is not under repair from the recent Hurricane.  Ask that up-front before booking.  Anita Fleming commented to me that they are calling customers under contract 1-day before there arrival to let them know the property is not available (still under repair).

We only got to stay for 3 days and 4 nights.  I have 2 reviews for the condo experience.\n\nFirst for the condo owners...The condo was beautiful. Very tastefully decorated.  9/10. The only reason that I didn\u2019t give it a 10/10 is because I am personally not a fan of rain style shower heads and both showers had them.  I am a woman with thick hair and it is impossible to get conditioner completely rinsed out of thick hair with a rain style shower head.  Also, there were 2 Tupperware containers but no lids.  Would have loved to been able to save some left over food for lunch the next day, but hard to do without lids. Otherwise the place itself was perfect! Plenty of dishware  and glassware. King sized comfortable beds in both bedrooms and no carpeting anywhere.  The view is what we came for and it did not disappoint! Love the couch on the balcony!\n\nThe next review is for the rental company, Liquid Life.  I would give a 7/10  Most things were easy and handled well.  My reasons for not giving a 10/10 are the following: Not receiving the door code until check in time was a little bit nerve-wrecking. I am a planner, so not having check in details until we arrived made me a little bit nervous. Also, one roll of 1 ply toilet paper per bathroom for 2 women for 4 nights is not enough. We drink coffee in The morning, water all day, and wine in the evening. We pee. And one ply TP doesn\u2019t work very well so you have to use more, then it runs out quick. Also, there was absolutely no hand soap anywhere in the condo. We are at the end of a pandemic and there is no way to wash our hands without going to buy soap. They give you make-up remover wipes and lotion, but no soap.  When paying this much for 3 days/4 nights, I don\u2019t want to have to also go buy TP and soap, Or call the rental company and wait for someone to bring some. Just don\u2019t want to be bothered to have to call someone and ask for TP and soap. The last reason is for cleanliness.  It was pretty good. The linens were clean, no sand in the sheets, the kitchen and bathrooms were clean, no problems there, but I believe the floors (all tile and vinyl, no carpet) must have just been swept or maybe vacuumed, but not mopped or wet swiffered, because after we arrived the first night, we got settled, I took off my shoes and walked around the condo barefoot until I went to bed. I noticed my feet were filthy dirty when getting ready for bed. I had not been outside barefoot at all, just walking around inside the condo for a few hours. The balcony had something that had been spilled on it, maybe coffee? That had been missed by the cleaning crew.\n\nAll in all, I would give it an 8/10.  We loved the location because there weren\u2019t any other condos on either side right next to it, so the beach was less crowded.  There was construction going on right next to it, so that could change if they are putting up another building there. Also, I slept in the room closest to the road and hear a lot of loud sirens each night. The young man renting chairs and umbrellas on the beach was super personable and accommodating.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621264863164, "text": "Thank you for your review, Cory!

I made the reservations by phone to ensure the unit had never had pets and was told the whole building was pet free. When we arrived at the unit, we were greeted by a portrait of dogs and a condo covered in dog hair. Two of our family members had allergic reactions shortly after our arrival. I vacuumed up large bags of pet hair myself. The patio furniture was all inside, the front door stop was broken, and one of the tubs didn\u2019t drain. These were all small nuisances compared to the allergic reactions we were dealing with. I contacted Liquid Life. They would not move us to a comparable unit! We were told they would refund the cleaning fee & one nights rent if we signed a form stating we would not report this to the Better Business Bureau or comment any negativity about them on social media. I could not sign the form! It would be unethical not to warn other allergy suffers of the allergy concerns. Randy, the owner of the Liquid Life company sent me the rudest email I have ever received in my life! I did a Google search and found out Liquid Life had made the news and had a class action lawsuit against them. My family was lied to! My family\u2019s health was put in jeopardy because of Liquid Lies! My money was waisted because my son and sister-in-law could not remain in the condo with the pet hair! Liquid Life is still falsely advertising Phoenix West II unit 2309 as a pet free unit! I regret renting from this unethical company!\n\nI only left one review! I have no clue how it would be possible to leave more than one. I did fill out the survey that Liquid Life sent me, maybe that is what you are referring to. The numerous negative reviews on Google and the Better Business Bureau speak volumes about this company! I am astonished by the lack of customer service the company in showing in their rude replies to their customers\u2019 reviews. Liquid Life blames every complaint on the property owners and takes no responsibility for their company!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601292866764, "text": "Amy, we are so terribly sorry that this happened to you. This is, in fact, a pet-free unit. However, the owners of the unit brought their pets prior to your stay without our knowledge. We do not control what the actual owners of these properties do on their own time. With that being said, you say that you booked over the phone to ensure it was a pet-free unit. We show in our system that you booked via a hot deal on our website, and it is coded differently than phone bookings. We also do not have any notes under your reservation regarding a call prior to your stay regarding any guests with allergies. We try our very best to accomodate all guests in the best way possible when it comes to these sorts of things, especially if we are informed ahead of time. During your stay, we sent our cleaning team out to you the day after you arrived as you denied them to come on your first evening. We could not move you to another unit at Phoenix West II as we were booked at that time. We did, however, offer to move you to another complex and you refused. You said that you wanted a full refund for your stay as well as a free stay in another unit. We tried to rectify this situation in the best way possible, and you continued to deny our offer. The only reason you received an unpleasant email from our owner is because you sent every staff member in our company a very demanding and hateful email after being given multiple solutions to your issue and you denying them. Once again, we are so sorry this happened to your family. We in no way lied about the unit or intended anyone harm in the process, and we tried our best to make this situation better for you."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f95e0f40cd:0x357d2c5a26b9a07b"}

After Hurricane Sandy caused all the destruction in Gulf Shores/O.B., we thought there may have been a chance that our vacation would be cancelled.  We understood.  After the Liquid Life team was back up and running, I called to verify the house we had rented would be available.  We were told \"as of now\" it is good.  I called back a few days later to see if there was a possibility of booking an additional 2 days.  I was told by an extremely nice lady that she would pencil us in for those two days and that if there was a problem with adding those two days, they would let us know.  The week prior to our departure, I never heard anything back so I called to make sure those two extra days were good and to go ahead and pay for them.  They had already taken out my final payment on the rental for the original 5 nights.  After I was forwarded to another clerk, I was told that none of our nights were going to be available.  This information comes to me 5 days prior to our departure.  I feel this is very poor communication on Liquid Life's behalf.  The lady that told me the house was not going to be available was extremely rude!  Then, they proceeded to tell me it would take a week or longer for me to receive my refund. Management was supposed to call me back the following day.  Crickets!  I called L.L. back and they proceeded to tell me that they tried calling.  My phone never rang, had a missed call in the log or a voicemail left.  They wanted to charge me a fee to put it back on my credit card so I had to wait on a check.  As a retail manager for many years, I feel this team failed miserably in communication.  I'm deeply saddened that the residents/owners suffered from this natural disaster.

This post is more about the difference between staying in a full service hotel, vs a vacation rental property.  The win, is you have a full condo with kitchen and over 1100 sq ft of space of Gulf Front views.   Hotel rooms are usually 400 sq ft and they provide what you are looking for in paper goods.   We hope it in the future you will enjoy the extra space and features of the condo, often at the same or lower price than a hotel room.

The balcony is large with a view of the resort entrance and of the beach. We enjoyed drinking our coffee and eating our breakfast on the balcony each morning. The washer and dryer really came in handy for towels and swimwear and the icemaker was super convenient for making big pitchers of ice water. We had a couple of concerns of which I called Liquid Life about, and they were quick to resolve these issues. Of major concern was that the A/C was not working at all when we arrived, but Liquid Life got maintenance to the condo within a couple of hours and that problem was resolved.\n\nThe not so Good: The cleaning staff needs careful monitoring. For the most part, the condo was clean, but there were a couple of glaring issues. The living room furniture is of cloth upholstery and had stains which should be treated with upholstery cleaner by the cleaning staff. There was also some sort of child's cereal, looked like Fruity Pebbles, scattered on the living room sectional and also under the balcony dining table, which I cleaned up. The bedspread in one of the guest bedrooms had a fairly long brown streak running across it. I called Liquid Life and they notified housekeeping to come change out all of the linens in that particular room.\n\nI am giving this condo a four out of five rating only because of the cleaning issues. Had the condo been cleaned properly, I would have easily given it a five. I have no complaints about Liquid Life Vacation Rentals. They took my concerns seriously and made everything right for us. I would, however,  like to see them follow up on the cleaning staff in the future. But, having said all that, I would definitely stay in this condo again, and I would definitely book through Liquid Life again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1599675308379, "text": "Thank you for your review, Jenny!

Yes he is fine but if an adult would have been up there the people sleeping underneath could have been hurt. Maintenance came out right away and fixed it but we still weren\u2019t comfortable using the top bunks anymore and had to go purchase air mattresses for the rest of the trip. The dryer is either broke or just needs to be replaced. It takes a few times to get things dried. There isn\u2019t enough towels in the bathrooms for 12 people. We also had a bit of a roach problem in the kitchen. It needs to be updated in the kitchen for sure. My father went to put a spatula away in the drawer and the whole drawer broke and fell on top of his foot. Minor cut but he is fine. The sliding door in the master bedroom isn\u2019t working either.

This was our first time going with this particular company. Hurricane Sally hit and devasted Gulf Shores! We called and was going to reschedule our stay til next year but they didn't have the schedule for that far ahead. They kindly cancelled our reservation for us and told us how to get in touch with the travel insurance company. We have always took out the insurance but never had to use it. The travel insurance, Red Sky, was a whole other story. I done the claim on 9/24. I called and they said it could take up to 30 days to hear from the claim. I emailed them and never heard from them by email. I called on 10/2 and 10/14 and was told both times that it was being processed and I would hear from them as soon as a decision had been made. I received and email on 10/16 stating that my claim had been denied. I immediately called and was told since it had been 30 days since the hurricane hit, which was on 9/16, that the 30 days window had expired. It just seems odd how it was exactly 30 days since it hit that I receive the email. After talking with multiple people, including managers, I was just getting the run around and no answers. As I was on the phone with them, I had a missed called. It was Anita from Liquid Life and asked me to call them back. I called and before I could say anything, she said they received notification from Red Sky that our claim had been denied and she was just letting me know that Liquid Life was cutting me a check for the refund amount. This people shows how great of a company this is. Liquid Life was always helpful and made things right even when they didn't have too and they done it on their own. I will be going thru them all the time now for our yearly trips to the Gulf!

At 5.40 p.m. I finally was able to reach someone and they sent the door code at 5:44p.m. When we got to the door there was no keypad to enter codes as it was a key card only.

Someone came the next day in the afternoon and gave us 2 more cards. The condo was nice but the appliances were dated. The freezer door on the fridge would not shut properly due to a problem with the ice maker. A toilet seat was very loose and when we walked around on the floor barefoot the bottoms of our feet were black implying the floors had not been properly cleaned.

I called earlier in the afternoon to inform Liquid Life we had arrived and was told I would get a text when our condo was ready.  We had gone grocery shopping for our week and now had $400 in groceries in our car for two hours. At 5 PM I called Liquid Life and inquired as to when the condo would be ready. I was told maintenance was tending to several issues so that the condo would be \u201cperfect\u201d for our arrival.  We got our text at 5:30 PM.   Even though I registered 10 guests we were given 5 keys but only 4 worked.  I was told by Liquid Life that I should check with the Caribe and they could give me more.  I had to buy more for $5 each.  We had to have maintenance come and fix the lock on the door.\nOnce in the condo as we were putting groceries away the refrigerator door would not stay shut.  The cleaning people had not put the drawers in properly.  I was going to cook dinner but the condo had no fry pans, a broken electric can opener, no manual can opener. There were no baking sheets, no pot holders, no spatulas.  The oven took 40 minutes to preheat to 400 degrees.   The blender had no lid.  I called Liquid Life to complain and the next day they did bring a new blender, fry pans, pot holders, can opener and baking sheets.\nThe bed in room 2 is a joke.  They actually have a mattress laying on a metal bed frame with no box spring or support.  The metal bed frame was also broken.  There is no way any one could sleep on this bed.  Liquid Life came and looked at it on Monday but did nothing to replace it.  We were told that it was furniture and it had to be approved by the owner.\nThe toilet in bedroom one would not quit running.  The toilet in the master bathroom overflowed all over the floor on Sunday morning. Maintenance came and fixed both but left the wet plastic he had in the trash.  We cleaned up the floor.  No one from housekeeping came to clean up the floor and sanitize it.  We used our towels, paper towels and disinfecting spray.\nWhen I booked the condo I registered 10 people.  Upon arrival we had 8 towels and washcloths in the unit.  I had to call and request more the first night. .  They brought 2 towels.   I must say they brought more after the toilet overflowed since I had to use ours to wipe up the floor.\nEach condo rental with Liquid Life is charged $189 cleaning fee.  Bedroom one has a shower curtain full of mold!!!  The shower in the master bedroom has mold all along the shower door and in corners.  We did take pictures and shared them with Liquid Life. Obviously things are not cleaned as they should be. There should be a checklist so nothing is missed.\nLiquid life offered me a $250 refund but to receive it I would have to sign an agreement that I and my family would not post any negative comments on any review, social media or Better Business Bureau. If I did they would charge my credit card on file for $250.  I declined.  I feel others need to beware of this condo and future rentals with Liquid Life.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598277259322, "text": "We are so sorry you feel this way, Lynne.

A speaker flew off the balcony and nearly hit us.  The back door wouldn't lock.  The garage door wouldn't close.  The wonderful part was how we called several times to have the trashed picked up and as we pulled away a week later, the 20 bags of stench and flies still sat there.  The fridge leaked.  The couch in the living room was sunken in.  The surround sound didn't work.  The kitchen faucet wouldn't shut off.  There were not enough bath towels, no laundry basket or dust pan (we bought one).  There was 1 dish towel and 1 wash rag, so we bought more.  It was missing the \"basics\" a family would need for a week.  We had to buy a bbq grill since the 2 on the back porch were a rusted mess.  The tv in several rooms didn't work (normally wouldn't have been a big deal but the beach was closed for several days and we were stuck in the house).  Several windows on the main floor leaked.  Overall the house was filthy with thick build up on the vents and a heavy layer of sand and dirt under the couch.  I attempted to clean but the vacuum cleaner didn't work.  This house is run down and in bad shape.  The worst part was management not being accountable.  It's obvious the owners don't live locally or care enough to properly give it the updates it sadly needs.  When we addressed the issues, management blew it off.  The maintenance man did fix the door and a/c later in the week but this house was not ready for visitors.  Management tried to validate each issue and offered no apology!  With comments like \"had we known the state of the grills, we would've replaced them\", it's clear nobody is claiming ownership.  How is a management company not aware that 2 rusted out grills with 1 leg, were shoved in the corner on the back porch?  Come on!!!  Someone should take a tour of the house to assure it's prepared for each guest and give it a deep clean.

A repair guy showed up and said he woud get us a loaner. They did but it did not fit in the closet so it stuck out and we could not close door.. Second problem Refrigerator.  No ice on arrival, We went to grocery store bought $200 worth of groceries. Came back and put the food in the refrig.  Several hours later food warm, still no ice.  Called office and they said that it will take 24 hours for the refrig to get cold. They turn it off between renter. The said dont worry your food wont go bad. HA  We had warm drinks until the next morning. Friday they told me that they would send someone out that evening to look at the refrig. NO ONE ever showed up/ I have NEVER stayed in a condo where the refrig was not ready and working.  Putting groceries away. Kitchen was disgusting. Dried food on cabinets. HAIR and dirt in kitchen drawers. HAIR on top of utensils.  My son went to rest on couch and the throw pillows had dried blood on them. Curtains had dried body fluids -my guess vomit Called and complained and they sent someone to clean the kitchen. They removed the covers off the pillows and put the throw pillows in a closet. The next person that gets to stay there gets bloody throw pillows with a clean covering. They did nothing with the curtains. We got to live with those. Then I was making mac and cheese and found a dead roach in the cabinet. I got to call again!  Bug guy came and sprayed. GROSS>  They told me I had talked to almost everyone in the office and they are resolving our problems and what else do we want. They told me they would reach out Monday to make sure we were happy and things were going well. We checked out on Wednesday and never did we hear from the office staff.  Also the ice maker wasn't working. just dripping water on the floor .  They Sent someone out. They chipped away at some frozen ice around a gear and said it would work. Well it did not the whole time we were there, just dripped water so we just turned off the ice maker because this place is no help,  The last night we were there we saw roaches running in the kitchen by the laundry machine.  I gave up talking to the office because they obviously dont care. They just patch things up and hope people leave them alone.  I could not relax in the condo. It was so stressful. Oh we also were not allowed to hang our towels on the balcony railing. We had security telling us to take them down. Security also banged on our door one other time- they had the wrong condo.  There is no management  on this site. NO one to personally go talk to  Horrible experience. We should be refunded part of our money for all of the above problems. Did not rest the whole time there. I asked for our money back so we could go to another condo but they would not do that either. We were stuck!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f95e0f40cd:0x357d2c5a26b9a07b"}

Offering a credit is not going to work, this crisis is out of everyone's control, the best thing to do is work together right now. We had quite a few families going on this trip, 4 other families booked through different companies in Alabama and they all got full refunds no questions asked. So only Liquid Life Rentals is not refunding their customers. If the governor shut them down, by law they should have to refund us, they can get emergency assistance. With that being said, are they going to keep our money and still ask for assistance??? I wouldn't put it past them.

We are staying here for 11 nights and paid over $4,000.  We came in on Tuesday which was the day Hurricane Gordon was hitting.  We called the office to ask if we could check in early as we had seen on the calendar that no one stayed in the unit Monday night.  The girl I spoke with was not helpful and just kept telling me their policy.  I knew what the policy was, what I was asking for was at least some effort to see if she could check when we would be able to get in.  She would not do it.  I ask to speak with her boss and she said she was out cleaning condos and did not have her number.  I asked to speak to one of the inspectors and she said she didn't have any of their numbers.  She never once offered to go above and beyond other than telling me what the policy was.  I had 3 kids in a car headed towards a tropical storm growing into a Hurricane and just wanted someone to say \"let me see what I can do\", but that did not happen.  We got the call at 2:45pm that our condo was ready, which we were waiting in the parking garage at the condo as the tropical storm had already began to hit.  Condo was clean and ready and then we noticed the stand alone ice maker was missing, like was not there and was just a blank space.  This is something that we love and use all the time when we stay at Phoenix West II.  I called Liquid Life and they said it was our for maintenance.  I explained that this is something that we use everyday and could they bring a spare one until the other got fixed.  She said they don't have spare ones and her solution was that if the refrigerator ice maker did not keep up, then I could go to the store, buy bagged ice and then bring them the receipt.  Really????  I just paid $4,000 for 11 nights and you want me to leave the condo to go buy bagged ice every time I need to fill the cooler and then bring you the receipt.....  I then called back and got another girl who said she would have maintenance call me the next day.  No one called and we are still here without a separate ice maker.  This is our 7th year to stay at either Phoenix West and/or Phoenix West II and we really enjoyed it.  Things happen and I realize that, but I don't believe stating policy when there is a Hurricane Warning in place and telling someone to go buy bagged ice is the right things to do in these situations.  I am not saying don't rent through Liquid Life, but I did want to share our current situation so you can make an educated decision.  I even mentioned to the front desk here that we were trying to get checked in early due to the approaching storm and when I told them who I rented through they rolled their eyes like there was a history there with Liquid Life and these kind of issues.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGSNg59boQqmjle6-ZO9gyWeH0tR3kLN8VhYp5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1536247802374, "text": "Josh,  Thanks for writing.

By this time I had been asking for the Wi-Fi code for two days. Still not got it. A man came at four on Monday and fix the AC\u2019s. They sent two Boys to hang curtains because I had teenage girls changing in the living room since it\u2019s one bedroom. \u202aTuesday morning\u202c I woke up went down to my car and it had a notice that it was going to be towed. I contacted the property manager who told me I should have had a packet left in the room which I did not. Now, Still fighting for the wifi on Tuesday. Finally, someone showed up later that day to fix the Wi-Fi problem and bring a welcome packet so we could hang a sticker on her car Mirror. What should have a been a vacation from the stress I\u2019ve been through after recovering from open heart surgery last year along with 4 strokes and months of therapy turned into a stressful situation. Each day of the vacation I woke to a new problem and ended in tears fighting back and forth with liquid life. Anita was kind however. They offered me $250 back of the $1200 I paid. I didn\u2019t take it bc they wanted me to sign something saying I couldn\u2019t leave online reviews or go to social media or bbb. I did not feel that was fair to other people. After all, I still had one day right? What could go wrong? I saved all my washing for that day. When I went to dry the clothes the dryer did not dry. 4 turns on same load STILL not dry. I reported it to liquid life and they didn\u2019t respond. I saved the text just incase they said I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve literally had tears every day of my vacation. I\u2019ve tried to make the best of it as I\u2019m not suppose to be stressed. In my opinion they owe me a refund. Unit 16 at Perdido skye never should have been rented. I\u2019ve taken pics and hope I\u2019m able to share them. On a positive note it\u2019s convenient to elevator and the property has a nice pool, and is convenient to beach. Nice views. I wondered if it was the story for every unit in the building and it\u2019s not. I saw 54 online which was really nice! Probably managed better. The bottom line is unit 16 SHOULD NOT have been rented until it was ready. after not taking the $250 bc the wanted time to sign something saying I wouldn\u2019t talk on the experience, I reported this same thing to the bbb.  Their response was that they tried to offer me money and I came back 3 times for more.  Lies.  I was offered $205 and I said that wasn\u2019t a fair amount.  On the same phonecall we came up woth $250 just to be done, I Said ok.  The they sent the thing I had to sign saying I couldn\u2019t post anything to anyone on social media or the Better Business Bureau. I felt like this was not enough for me to sit back, shut up And watch other families get ripped off. Then I wake up the next day to a dryer that didn\u2019t work and they never sent anybody out to fix it. Glad I did not sign. I really feel like they owe me a complete refund if they are reputable business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592229113919, "text": "JT, we are so sorry you had so many issues with your stay!

We cancelled after this new rental agreement and have proof by email that we would get a full credit.  One month later (without any prior communication) we received a check in the mail for $1000 with the statement that they were not offering the full credit anymore. So they kept $500 for \"non-refundable\" fees. We tried to see if booking for the same dates next year plus the 20% discount would be a wash, but we still would have to pay hundreds more dollars.. They will NOT pick up their phones to talk about it. Even VRBO agents were frustrated with them (they could not patch me though to them on the phone) VRBO stated that they were encouraging every company to give a full refund and VRBO even refunded VRBOs portion of the fee .

Your comment above is partial information, taken extremely out of context with significant exaggerations.\n\nOur Condo Care Team worked faithfully to serve you and to provide you with excellent service.

When we arrived we could see that major construction was going on, yet we were not advised of this, nor were we given an opportunity to switch buildings.  They came on the second day and draped our balcony in plastic sheeting to where we could not sit and look out at the water.  They also put up a large sheet of plywood blocking off over half of what balcony was left.  There was scaffolding going up and down all days from 9 to 5, with loud talking and banging of equipment.  This severely impacted our stay, and when I went to complain to the office they said there was nothing they could do, nor could they give me a discount for the inconvenience when I requested it.\nIn addition to this, the pool and hot tub in the Phoenix IV building was roped off and out of order for most of the week, so we had to go outside and next door to use the very crowded pool at hot tub at Phoenix III.\nUnit 4023 itself was nice and very spacious, which was needed for our group of family and cooking the Thanksgiving dinner.  However, the unit slept 10, but there was only one set of towels for 8, and only one dish cloth and dish towel in the kitchen, and NO hot pads at all.  We just kept washing them over and over.\nOne other thing:  Due to the construction, our TV reception was intermittently out most of the week.  We could not watch the Parade or football games I had planned.  All in all, it was a VERY disappointing week.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1511801199256, "text": "Hi Marilyn, Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review about your recent stay.

We looked in to your reservation and saw that you did come in to our office a few days in to your stay to let us know about the balcony and to see if there were any discounts if you booked with us again next year. Unfortunately, our team was correct and there was nothing they could do about the balcony but we certainly could have done something about the towels and hot pads had we known.

When we arrived we could see that major construction was going on, yet we were not advised of this, nor were we given an opportunity to switch buildings.  They came on the second day and draped our balcony in plastic sheeting to where we could not sit and look out at the water.  They also put up a large sheet of plywood blocking off over half of what balcony was left.  There was scaffolding going up and down all days from 9 to 5, with loud talking and banging of equipment.  This severely impacted our stay, and when I went to complain to the office they said there was nothing they could do, nor could they give me a discount for the inconvenience when I requested it.\nIn addition to this, the pool and hot tub in the Phoenix IV building was roped off and out of order for most of the week, so we had to go outside and next door to use the very crowded pool at hot tub at Phoenix III.\nUnit 4023 itself was nice and very spacious, which was needed for our group of family and cooking the Thanksgiving dinner.  However, the unit slept 10, but there was only one set of towels for 8, and only one dish cloth and dish towel in the kitchen, and NO hot pads at all.  We just kept washing them over and over.\nOne other thing:  Due to the construction, our TV reception was intermittently out most of the week.  We could not watch the Parade or football games I had planned.  All in all, it was a VERY disappointing week.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1511801199256, "text": "Hi Marilyn, Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review about your recent stay. We sincerely apologize that you had a disappointing week at the beach. Our goal is to make sure all of our guests have the best vacation possible. So, we take customer service very seriously. We looked in to your reservation and saw that you did come in to our office a few days in to your stay to let us know about the balcony and to see if there were any discounts if you booked with us again next year. Unfortunately, our team was correct and there was nothing they could do about the balcony but we certainly could have done something about the towels and hot pads had we known. Our terms and conditions state that we can not guarantee amenities at the complex because we only manage specific units and not the complex as a whole. We do try to find solutions to these problems when they occur and are very sorry we could not do that for you. Thank you again for your feedback."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f95e0f40cd:0x357d2c5a26b9a07b"}

We are staying here for 11 nights and paid over $4,000.  We came in on Tuesday which was the day Hurricane Gordon was hitting.  We called the office to ask if we could check in early as we had seen on the calendar that no one stayed in the unit Monday night.  The girl I spoke with was not helpful and just kept telling me their policy.  I knew what the policy was, what I was asking for was at least some effort to see if she could check when we would be able to get in.  She would not do it.  I ask to speak with her boss and she said she was out cleaning condos and did not have her number.  I asked to speak to one of the inspectors and she said she didn't have any of their numbers.  She never once offered to go above and beyond other than telling me what the policy was.  I had 3 kids in a car headed towards a tropical storm growing into a Hurricane and just wanted someone to say \"let me see what I can do\", but that did not happen.  We got the call at 2:45pm that our condo was ready, which we were waiting in the parking garage at the condo as the tropical storm had already began to hit.  Condo was clean and ready and then we noticed the stand alone ice maker was missing, like was not there and was just a blank space.  This is something that we love and use all the time when we stay at Phoenix West II.  I called Liquid Life and they said it was our for maintenance.  I explained that this is something that we use everyday and could they bring a spare one until the other got fixed.  She said they don't have spare ones and her solution was that if the refrigerator ice maker did not keep up, then I could go to the store, buy bagged ice and then bring them the receipt.  Really????  I just paid $4,000 for 11 nights and you want me to leave the condo to go buy bagged ice every time I need to fill the cooler and then bring you the receipt.....  I then called back and got another girl who said she would have maintenance call me the next day.  No one called and we are still here without a separate ice maker.  This is our 7th year to stay at either Phoenix West and/or Phoenix West II and we really enjoyed it.  Things happen and I realize that, but I don't believe stating policy when there is a Hurricane Warning in place and telling someone to go buy bagged ice is the right things to do in these situations.  I am not saying don't rent through Liquid Life, but I did want to share our current situation so you can make an educated decision.  I even mentioned to the front desk here that we were trying to get checked in early due to the approaching storm and when I told them who I rented through they rolled their eyes like there was a history there with Liquid Life and these kind of issues.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGSNg59boQqmjle6-ZO9gyWeH0tR3kLN8VhYp5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1536247802374, "text": "Josh,  Thanks for writing.

I think giving a 3 rating is being kind and only because I enjoyed being at the beach. To start when we arrived the code that was given to us to get into the condo was incorrect, we called and they had to reset it so we had to wait outside of our room for 10 mins, wouldn\u2019t have been that big of a deal if we had not already unpacked our vehicle and had our belongings sitting outside the door so we couldn't just go ride around or explore the facility while we waited. Secondly as soon as we walked in we noticed the sand all over the floors, now I understand that we are at the beach but I expect to walk into a clean condo when I first arrive. There was also sand on the counters and on the comforters on each bed, dried food on the floor, and hair in the shower, tubs, and dryer so I do not feel this place was cleaned well/if at all! Granted they did offer to send someone to come clean it again but one if they did that poorly the first time what good is that going to do it is not like they were rushed because there was no one renting the place the entire day prior and secondly we already had all of our belongings unpacked by the time I received a call back the next day. There are a few other things such as not having a WiFi password in the room and having to text back and forth several time to get it, Being told twice it was open, not the case it was locked and required password, the large roach that came out from under the kitchen counter, oil on utensils, plus other disappointing factors. This is not a knock towards SeaChase whatsoever, we have stayed there before and room was great, the facility is wonderful itself! I think had our room been cleaned this would have been a 5 star or very close!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568668334936, "text": "We are sorry you feel this way, Kayla!

We\u2019ve stayed at this facility in different units previous years and have had no issues. This year was quite different than in past years. The unit was clean and looked to have been somewhat updated in recent months. Unfortunately, the beds were extremely uncomfortable and it made the entire week there somewhat disappointing. Neither my husband nor I are picky with mattresses, but the mattresses provided to us were TERRIBLE!  None of us were able to get any rest at night due to the thin mattresses with lumps and springs poking into our backs. When I reached out to customer service we were told that they would send someone from their Quality Assurance department over to inspect them that day. No one ever came to look at them and when I contacted customer service again I was told that they were waiting for the owner of the unit to approve mattress replacements. That was on Tuesday and we never heard back from anyone with Liquid Life Vacation Rentals. I made three separate attempts to get the issue resolved and they didn\u2019t give the common courtesy to rectify the problem. This was by far the worst customer service we\u2019ve ever experienced while  vacationing in Gulf Shores. My suggestion is to try either Meyer or Kaiser vacation Rentals. We\u2019ve used both in the past and had to request service once with each and they both addresses our concerns immediately.

First let me say the unit was lovely and we did enjoy our stay but we do have a few major concerns\n\n\u2014first We did have a small issue with cleanliness. Obviously we pay the CLEANING fee So I assume those who stayed before us paid the same but there were several areas that were not clean. But Counter still had some residue on them. The floors didn\u2019t look mopped and if they were it was done very poorly. You could still see areas where drinks were dropped and partially cleaned up but there was still stickiness etc. We cleaned up ourselves.   If we\u2019re going to pay a cleaning fee I would hope the cleaning would occur better than that.\n\n\u2014 The BIGGEST ISSUE  is we learned a third-party individual gained access to our condo while we were out at the beach.    First let me say we stay at this condo because we have to close friends who both owned condos nearby.  By pure coincidence we were at the beach with our friends   And other acquaintances who live there full time.  One of which realized the unit we were in and told us he entered the unit earlier that day at the request of the OWERS BUT WITHOUT LIQUID LIFE KNOWING. HE SAID THE OWNERS GAVE HIM THE OWNERS CODE AND ASKED HIM TO CHECK ON THEIR OWNERS CLOSET.   This was of course during our stay we just happen to not to be there at the time.  This came across a bit concerning to us that a third-party was given private access to the condo we were currently staying in and somebody visited while we were not there. LET ME REPEAT.  LIQUID LIFE LET A STRANGER ACCESS THE CONDO WHILE WE WERE THERE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE. We have no reason to believe anything occurred but it\u2019s a bit unnerving knowing somebody was allowed in without our knowledge.\nWhat if we were there?? And some stranger just walked in?  We also had three young teenage girls with us who could\u2019ve been there by themselves.   Is this normal practice?\n\n\u2014Lastly we had a bit of an issue with the checkout process. Liquid life contacted us through text asking if we wanted to add an extra night to our trip which which r liquid Life contacted us through text asking if we wanted to add an extra night to our trip which we chose to do. Essentially we would leave on Sunday versus Saturday as we had planned.  But even though we had arranged this apparently the texting system and code system were unaware.  We kept receiving check out texts and eventually we were locked out of our unit because the system was not updated. We called the office who did rectify this immediately and did a great job  correcting the  error but was inconvenient. Also one note on Saturday morning around 9am  A gentleman with a Liquid Life shirt attempted to enter the unit.   Thankfully we had done the bolts so he was unable to access.  We answered the door and he was surprised to see someone thinking the unit was empty.   So  we assumed he was not notified of our extra night but just us concerning he showed up at 9 AM when our checkout time was not until 10 AM even if that was the day we were leaving.\n\nThe unit and location were great.   The concern is more about the operations of Liquid Life.\n\nI contact liquid life with our concerns through email and through their own survey but have never been contacted to discuss or apologize.  Unfortunate.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1557598660097, "text": "We are sorry you feel this way about your stay, Chris.

Seven days in August costs less than 3 during the 4th of July, and Liquid Life's price was the best of them all. The Lighthouse itself is mind-blowing huge, with 3 pools, 2 hot tubs, sauna, and gym.

We recently stayed at Phoenix West,  booked through liquid life. Upon arriving at the condo we found the blender was broken.  We went to the front desk asking for a replacement and the desk person told us you didn\u2019t book through Brett Robinson call liquid life and get them to help. Then we realized upon going to bed that the bed in the master bedroom was broken. Two of three wooden slats underneath the bed were cracked in multiple places so we immediately took pictures and called it in. All the while upon traveling down, my dad who booked the room had agreed to allow a real estate showing at 10 am on our second morning. Who does that?  Charge someone 600 per night then ask if they can show the place to a prospective buyer?  He actually had agreed but upon the 2 problems and the treatment from the desk person decided he was unwilling to work with them. He waited in the room half of the first day waiting on someone to fix the bed after he had to sleep on a broken bed the night before. What a way to spend VACATION time.  Next day the refrigerator went out. We called first thing in the morning and were told to place the setting to 5 and wait. We did then called back after a few hours of a hot refrigerator  we were told someone would be out within 3 hours to fix it. I personally called back and explained we had food about to go bad because we had followed their instructions to no avail. Between 30 min to an hour later a fridge repair person came and used a hair dryer to defrost the fridge and changed a part on the fridge.  Upon returning home my dad called to share his experience with liquid life and was basically told that we were at fault because we put too much in the fridge and that the repair man told them nothing was wrong with the fridge. He WATCHED the guy change parts.\n\nIn short the unit should have been in working order for the entire stay and these oversights and other reviews lead me to believe liquid life does not have your vacation enjoyment at the forefront. Book with someone else.  I kinda understand why Brett Robinson people were unwilling to assist. I bet they deal with this daily.\n\nUPDATE:  please see owner\u2019s unprofessional response.\n\nYou would think the owner of a reputable company would have gathered facts before responding to a customer review and making false public accusations.  Your response appears to indicate we are still at the beach. We left 3 days ago. The only contact I have had with your company was a phone call regarding the refrigerator and my online reviews of our experience. Based upon my experience I don\u2019t expect to contact your company in the future.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ve not sent a single email, I was on a trip with my family and this is what I personally witnessed.\n\nSecondly \u201cobsessing\u201d about spending 2400 for 4 days and have multiple issues, clearly your view and mine differ here. I believe expecting to have a bed in working order prior to arrival is reasonable.\n\nThirdly, I\u2019m not sure what you consider \u201clong after\u201d issues are resolved. Addressing issues within a week of departure seems like a reasonable timeframe to me.\n\nFourth, my father watched the repair person change parts on a refrigerator that \u201cfelt hot\u201d. I guess my dad imagined that or he has decided after 60 plus years of life to become a liar as he was accused of by this company.\n\nThank you to the owner for confirming my decision to leave a review. Do yourself a favor and book elsewhere. Look at the responses to 1 star reviews throughout and you will see a company that makes nothing but excuses.\n\nWe certainly would have spent the money on someone else\u2019s 14 year old working condo had we known this team would have failed so badly and not care.  Based on the number of 1 star reviews here, on Facebook and the response from the owner I think the \u201cbad behavior\u201d does show itself. We are in agreement there. Your response is a clear cut example.\n\nU2: Maybe verifying names could offer additional clarity on the email mix up.

We host 10,000 families a year, which means we have lots of opportunities to help people navigate arriving at a condo and loading it with groceries and then \"feeling\" like it's hot. Vacation use is not home use. We get this. We responded immediately to the blender and the other issue. Again, I have watched the way you have communicated with my team, and I have watched the names and threats. Bad behavior is bad behavior, and it sticks out. I am the owner of the company.

We have rented from them on several occasions and will continue to do so. Unfortunately, my horrible experience is reflecting on you all because of the worst customer service I have ever experienced was displayed by a Bella Luna employee. We chose to give Bella Luna a try for our summer family vacation this year instead of staying at Phoenix West II, as we visit Orange Beach several times a year. We all immediately fell in love with the property and love all that it has to offer. The unit was decorated beautifully, the beds were all comfortable, the bed linens were beautiful as was the furniture. The unit was large and spacious and worked well for our entire party! We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Bella Luna until our last night there when we encountered an employee named \"Joe\" in the pool area. First, I FULLY understand that there are rules to follow as we have not had a single problem following them AT ALL during our stay. The kids were swimming and 5 of the adults were sitting around a table next to the pool chatting. We weren't being loud, obnoxious, or disorderly at all. Joe came and told us that we had 5 minutes until he was closing down the pool. We immediately began to gather our belongings and started making our way to the boat dock to assist family members with getting on their boat to take it to a launch area to go ahead and load it up as Bella Luna doesn't offer an actual launch. Joe stopped me and in an extremely rude manner started questioning me as to what we were doing and what unit we were in and so on. I explained to him that we were helping them get their boat launched real quick and that we would be back in just a minute and asked if he could hold the door for me. He told me I had 3 mins (which was the 3 minutes left until the pool closed) and if we weren't back, we would all be locked out. I'll spare you the rest of the ugliness that ensued as he yelled at me from across the pool area while I was walking down the boat dock. All I asked of him was for a tiny bit of compassion from him to hold the door for us for 2 minutes while we helped our family get on the boat and untied from the dock. I wasn\u2019t asking him to break any rules that would be detrimental to the establishment or anyone else for that matter. HE LOCKED US OUT! This place is a vacation town in the south where the hospitality should be nothing short of superior. ESPECIALLY in a hospitality area, there is NEVER EVER an exception for the lack of or poor customer service! I chose to spend a decent amount of money to stay here at Bell Luna. We have thoroughly enjoyed the property itself until we crossed paths with him. What has me more upset than anything, is the fact that he completely and utterly disrespected me in front of my children, my family, as well as all of the other patrons at the pool this evening. In my honest opinion, Joe lacks every single thing that it takes for someone to posses employment in the hospitality profession. It is blatantly obvious that he is miserable and does not like his job. He should seek employment elsewhere that does not deal with the general public, especially the hospitality industry. Not only that,  Bella Luna as a company should take action by reprimanding him or no longer employing him. Upon check out today, I spoke with the girls at the Liquid Life and they were FULLY aware of who Joe was, his complete lack of hospitality, and his wrath of rudeness as they have had several complaints on him. Shame on Bella Luna for continuing to employ someone of his magnitude especially after so many complaints! We WILL NOT be patronizing Bella Luna again as long as they choose to employ anyone of his magnitude. I couldn\u2019t fathom enduring his wrath of rudeness again in the future nor could I fathom any of my family or friends having to endure it as well. Due to his actions, they have not only lost a patron, but a former patron who will be sure to let everyone know about my experience here with \u201cJoe\u201d and will definitely encourage anyone else to choose to spend their money elsewhere!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532006409319, "text": "Kristin, we are so very sorry for this experience you had at Bella Luna!

This is the point where you find out what kind of agency you\u2019re renting from - we had always gotten competitive rates for the rentals, so I always questioned in the back of my mind if Liquid Life\u2019s customer service would be lacking.  I went to the office and explained what was going on.  Becky was very friendly and apologetic about the issue, and she had us moved to a different condo in an hour.  We have since fallen in love with the other unit and have booked it for a week next year.  This experience had made us very loyal Liquid Life customers, and we\u2019ll think twice before renting from an individual on vrbo, homeaway, etc in the future since an individual has very little they can do when there\u2019s a major issue with a unit.  There\u2019s always a chance that there can be an issue with any unit - I don\u2019t fault Liquid Life for that - the key is what is done about the problem.

Liquid life provided us with something better, a \"upgrade\" at no extra charge due to a not available anymore cpu error.  We loved Phonex West 2.  We had issues getting in the door on arrival on a sunday. Liquid life answered phone and resolved issue within minutes.  They checked on us throughout our stay via txt.  The condo and staff were super friendly, clean, roomy and ofcourse Orange Beach is the Best.  One good note also I read on previous post how elevators were slow or broke at Phonex West 2.  Haaa haaa, these were the faster elevators I've ever been on. I've traveled the world folks.  These were nice. We were on the 24th out of 32.  No issues.  There's a trick to parking also. Ya don't have to go all the way to 12th floor. You can catch blazing fast elevator on all floors. Driving all the way to 12th gets dizzy. We allways found one/two on 3rd floor. Parking pass is 38$ but this place is super clean and safe lots of security. Very family friendly. I don't like waring arm band but for the secure location I didn't mind.  Again liquid life took really good care of us from the start to finish. Will use them from now on.

All they could tell me was they could not do anything about it.  Brichette tried; however when I asked for Becky the supervisor to reach out to me she never called or returned any phone call.  My doctor even offered to write a letter to them; nonetheless they never returned my call and I was not able to go to the trip and lost all the money I had put into this.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

Imagine living through one of the worst winters ever.  Subzero temperatures. 12 inches of snow attached to a 29 mile long drive to work SEVERAL TIMES.  More snow so your drive home goes from 45 minutes to over 3 hours.  Plus... knowing that you are ready to make the move south.  The date of departure from the frozen tundra looms. 4 days until you hit the road to paradise.  Then, BOOM, an email... We are so sorry,  but the unit that you have booked is in need of immediate maintenance. But wait... we have moved you to another complex.  No ocean view but we think you will like it. I EXPLODED!!!!  I immediately called Liquid Life. Not a whole lot they could do for me. But they could refund me totally.  They tried to give me a description of the new place they were sending me to but I did not even want to listen.  I needed to get away and I just felt like maybe I should cancel the whole trip.  But I didn't.  I sent an absolutely horrific email to the owner of Liquid Life.  I received a phone call back from him within 1/2 hour.  They did come up with an answer. I could stay at 'the new place' for 4 days and then move to the original complex I booked.  NOT THE UNIT I BOOKED but the same complex. I agreed.  After driving for 2 days, we arrive at Liquid Life after hours.  There in the lock box was my packet.  The condo they chose for me was in the Caribe complex, on the intracoastal waterway.  We opened the door and entered PARADISE. I should have listened to the Liquid Life family when they were trying to explain the complex.  7 pools. so many Jacuzzis that you don't have time to use them all.  a restaurant with music serenading you through the most incredible sunset. The unit was pristine. The view was spectacular. The 4 days came and went in a heartbeat.  Then... The move... Over to the complex that I had originally booked.  I opened the door and was horrified.  It was like visiting the 1970's.  Bright yellow walls. So much so that you needed sunglasses. Burlap covered boxes for end tables. The view was on the interior curve of the building and when on the balcony, you could peer into the condos beside you. I burst into tears.  Everything was packed still in my car.  I was going to leave and drive home.  I called Liquid Life.  With some stroke of luck, the unit I just left, was available for the 10 days that I had left on my vacation.  I paid them a 'refresh' fee... FAIR... and moved back to paradise.  My son and his family arrived that night and the next 10 days were filled with kayaking, dolphin cruises, swimming, walking the beach, pools, hot tubs, eating. UGH... the eating. I am still full. The whole staff at Liquid Life could not have done more to try and accommodate me.  I have already booked my stay for next year.  You CANNOT go wrong booking through Liquid Life.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1520957289809, "text": "Hi Tricia! Thank you so much for taking time to leave us a review!

When we checked into the room, we quickly dropped our stuff and went to the pool. When we came back for the night, we noticed our condo was VERY dirty and the cleaning crew had done a substantially poor job. There were dirty dish in the dishwasher. Broken glasses in the cabinets. The bottoms of our feet were black after walking bare foot for a few minutes, so much so that we took it upon ourselves to mop the floor with plain water (all we had) to help. We called to inform liquid life of the condition of our room the next morning and they were extremely dismissive stating \"We called too late to get our deposit back.\" We were not interested in getting our deposit back. We felt that if you pay a company to do a job (clean the rooms) then you would probably want to know if they weren't performing said job. The lady on the phone was annoyed with our call and asked if we wanted them to send another cleaner out. Umm, no. I don't want someone from a company who is clearly not happy with my complaint to send someone into a condo with all of my belongings to reclean. The room is supposed to be clean BEFORE we arrive. That's why check in is so late. It was a simple matter. Please ensure your crew is doing their job.

The complete lack of caring about the customer\u2019s needs or any desire to make sure the customer gets what they payed for and expected to enjoy. We rented Florencia unit 708 from Liquid Life for the period of Oct 31- Dec15. We rented this condo with the primary purpose of entertaining our family that lives in the area as well as others visiting from out of state for the Thanksgiving Holiday Weekend. When we arrived we found the condo to be absolutely gorgeous and perfect for our plans. Three days after we arrived my wife tried to use the oven to cook some breakfast pastries and discovered it was inoperative. We called Liquid Life and informed them. On the same day a maintenance man showed up to service the fire extinguishers. We informed him about the oven he agreed it was broke and called his supervisor who did not respond. He said he would pass this along. Several days later we had still not recieved any response and contnued to call the office. After about a week an appliance man showed up and ordered a part said it would take a few days. My wife informed him about our plans to cook for Thansgiving, he said would definitely be fixed by then. Meanwhile we had no oven to cook meals for ourselves and incurred extra costs eating out with a fridge full of food we couldnt cook. The week of Thanksgiving arrived three weeks later. Still no oven, Liquid Life keeps telling us no worries, they will purchase a new oven if neccesary. On Wednesday we are frantic I call them at 3pm for fourth time that day a manager gets on the phone and tells us the best they could do is move us to another condo 5 miles away. I tell them this is unacceptable we have to leave for the airport to pick up guests that are arriving for the holiday. They tell me they will try to find another stove. My wife is crying she cant do all the baking she had planned. At 7 pm they show up with a stove they took from some other condo. It works but they tell me they have to leave the broken one in the middle of my living room. Mind you this is all occuring 3 weeks after the problem was first reported. We had our holiday and a week later the broke stove was stll in the middle of my living space. Thats when I wrote the owner of Liquid Life an email about what a joke his company is. He called me back and the first thing he does  is make a derogotory remark about my hispanic last name. He gives me his sincerest apologies but offers no compensation for our stress and inconvenience. Promise to get broken stove out right away but even that takes another two days. Took them four weeks to fix the problem and the whole time made it sound like we were somehow too demanding. The condo itself was beautiful do yourself a favor rent from someone else.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1513805484130, "text": "Hi Albert! We appreciate you taking the time to give us feedback about your recent stay. We take customer service very seriously and genuinely care about each one of our guests. We are extremely sorry you feel differently about that and would like to start by addressing the some of your concerns like your comment about the \"derogatory remark about my hispanic name\". Our Chief Operations Officer returned your call and asked how to properly pronounce your last name so he wouldn't insult you by saying it improperly. It was never his intention to be derogatory. You are completely correct about the length of time it took to reach a resolution about the oven. We take full responsibility for not communicating with you on how long the process would take to order and replace the necessary part to fix the oven as we were dealing with the Bosch warranty department.  Unfortunately, our management team was notified of this situation the day before Thanksgiving. Knowing you could not have a successful and happy Thanksgiving without one, and we could not find a replacement on that day, our owner relations manager donated her own personal oven for you and your family to use. It was never our intention for the broken oven to be left in the living room or left as long as it was. Our maintenance team was instructed by one of the guests to leave it. Once our management team was notified that the oven was still in the living room, we made arrangements for it to be removed. Due to weather restrictions it took additional time we were not expecting.  We hope that the rest of your stay was enjoyable.

When I booked a condo at the Phoenix X I did so because of the indoor pool for my grandchildren.  I booked it within less than 30 days of arrival.  About 7-10 days after booking I received a text informing me the pool would be closed for maintenance.  I  immediately called Liquid Life and requested to be moved to a different facility telling them about my small grandchildren.  The person at LIquid Life quickly informed me that I was within 30 days of arrival and as per policy I could not be moved.  She just kept wanting to recite  \"Policy\". S he also informed me that they did not have to provide a place with a pool because they are not responsible for maintenance issues but they had made arrangements for people to use the indoor pool at the Phoenix IX which was just next door and that we could walk there.  Again I explained that this time of year and with small children I preferred a place with an indoor pool for convenience.  She only spouted the policy.  Not one time did she make any effort to relocate me.  I requested to speak with the manager--I was sent a text explaining their \"policy\".  So much for customer service!\n\nUpon my arrival at the Phoenix X I discovered the distance between the Phoenix X and IX was .2 mile.  Also the people I met the one time we used the indoor pool informed me that they originally had reservations at the Phoenix x and was offered a relocation to the Phoenix IX for a $30 transfer fee by a different travel agency. I would have gladly paid a transfer fee.\n\nThe Phoenix X condo was very nice with a beautiful view.  Yes, I will continue to stay at the Phoenix Condos but will never again use LiquidLife.  They did not try to meet the needs of their customer that had booked a reservation in good faith.\n\nIn  2016 I had booked a condo through Liquid Life for Spring break and they called and informed me that the unit I had rented was withdrawn by the owner.  Liquid life could not find me another Condo with the same number of bedrooms/bathrooms for the price--wanted me to pay several hundred dollars more which I could not afford so they refunded my money. In surfing the internet I found the condo I had rented--just listed with a new realty agency.\nJackie Doubleman, Cullman, Al", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1510758009589, "text": "Hi Jackie.

After arriving we were horrified that the pics were deceiving! Apparently the pics were taken over 10 years ago and this condo has not been taken care of! Paint missing from walls, very old and dirty furniture and baseboards, and even the outdoor chairs were all stained up! It was also top layer dirty with food in the sink and the toilet seats were dirty. House cleaning lady came to the room and she said \"oh I'm so sorry, but I didn't clean this room\"! After speaking with Brittany with Liquidlife, she kindly apologized and moved us to condo 1107 after she had house cleaning make double sure it was clean. Although this condo was cleaner on the top layer than our original condo it was still not in any condition to be rented and the pics of it online are very deceiving as well. We could not enjoy ourselves for many reasons but the BAD smell in there was the biggest reason! Upon first entering the room it smelled like air freshener which had a nice scent. But within 30 or so minutes the stench was present and it never left! It smelled like wet stinking socks! We assumed it was coming from the old nasty \"shag\" carpet that was wet over a 10 yr period and now mildewed. We left the sliding doors open day and night for a fresh breeeze! Of course when the doors are open the AC cuts off but we didn't care! We chose fresh air over the funk! I spoke with Brittany about the horrific smell and she offered to have housecleaning come and spray something to help! LOL! Hence is why it initially smelled like air freshener! I told her thanks but no thanks! The furniture was so old and nasty we lined them with sheets to sit on. Outdoor furniture equally old and nasty. The dryer made a very loud noise while in use even with the laundry room door closed and the people in the condo above us were drilling to remove tile from that condo. I spoke with Brittany \"again\" regarding the upstairs noise and she said \"I\"m sorry they are removing tile and they are allowed to work from 9-5 on it\"! I left out many BAD things about both of these condos! If I wrote them all this would look like a novel! We had looked forward to a nice vacation and this was a nightmare vacation! I spoke with the owner of Liquidlife, Randy who was also kind but no help! He said he was sorry the condo we rented was so run down. He said they are privately owned and haven't been updated since they were built in 2006 and he cant make them update them! He said next time we should find a condo thats just been built like the Phoenix 2! On the bright side we didn't get bedbugs but we didn't even get in the jacuzzi tub in our room knowing what we knew and what we smelled! We had bad vibes from it and it was a costly lesson to us! You couldn't offer us to stay again there for free! This experience left a BAD taste (and smell) in our mouth and nose with condo rentals! You don't always get what you think you're paying for! You've been warned! Wish we had been warned! We tried to put a review on the Liquidlife website on these 2 BAD rooms but we weren't able because how convenient for them they have no place to write any reviews! Hence the reviews are 5 stars!

By 330, we still hadn't gotten a call, so we called back and they said that the cleaning was done, but there had to be an inspection completed before we could check in.  She said she would call us when it was complete.  It was about 4 pm when we finally got the call that we could check in.  So then we drove back to Liquid Life rental office and picked up the keys.\n\nUpon entering the Four Seasons building, it appeared to be a little run down and the elevator reeked of some smell that was present all week.  Fortunately, when we opened the door, the unit was very nice and well-equipped, but not overly clean (considering the length of cleaning time).   We had been told by the gate-keeper that it was probably their nicest unit there and that it had recently been renovated.\n\nThe furnishings, bedding, d\u00e9cor and such were lovely!  And the balcony was nicely furnished and the view was beautiful, so we were very thankful for this!   The vertical blinds at all three sliding door exits to the balcony did not work properly and we finally just got them open as much as we could and just left them open so we didn't have to fight with them.  We also learned quickly that the bedroom door on the master would automatically lock if it got pulled or blew closed, so we had to put duct tape over the latch, because we didn't see a key to it anywhere and none was mentioned.  Luckily we had opened the door to the patio before this happened initially, so we could go around and open that door back up.\n\nWe also had to call Liquid Life again that evening regarding the Wi-Fi connection and password.  They were not what we were given in our check in packet, but they were able to work that out for us by phone, so we were able to access that and that was much appreciated.\n\nThe most frustrating thing that we dealt with all week was that the gate to the beach access.  It had a very old push button bar and a code to punch in, but it very rarely worked properly....Almost every single time, we would have to punch it in numerous times, and then it would finally open.  This was both going in and coming out.  At one point, luckily the site manager was back by the pool and came and let me in.  I helped another older lady get in a couple of times because she was having issues with it too.\n\nAll in all, we had a week of beautiful beaches and sunshine and made some super memories with some family and friends. We were very thankful for the mostly perfect weather and the lovely condition of the beach. The pool area wasn't much and we never found a hot tub anywhere on the property.  The jetted tub in the Master barely worked.  There were reportedly exercise facilities, but you had to go out to the gate house to get someone to let you in each time if you wished to use them.  I think the real issue with this particular unit/resort is that there really isn't an office or anyone readily accessible if you need something, as we have been accustomed to at other locations.  We used Liquid Life last year for a visit to the Turquoise and that trip was just fine!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1464185659603, "text": "Hi Sherri. Thank you for taking the time to review us. We are glad to hear you enjoyed your vacation here in Orange Beach. This time of year can be very busy, and our housecleaners and quality assurance team work hard to ensure that every unit receives their best attention. As stated in our policies and procedures, check in begins at 3pm and our reservations staff maintains constant communication with the cleaning crew to make sure we get our guests to their units as soon as we possibly can. We put in a work order upon your departure regarding the information about the vertical blinds and the door problems. Thank you so much for letting us know! It is rare for a condominium here at the beach to staff a front desk team, as almost all units are privately owned and managed by outsourced vacation rental companies. We agree that it is convenient when the association is readily staffed for instances such as the beach gate issue at Four Seasons. This is a luxury you will find at other premium properties in the area, such as Turquoise Place. Thank you again for all the helpful information, Sherri. We appreciate you and your business. See you at the beach!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a06f95e0f40cd:0x357d2c5a26b9a07b"}

We weren\u2019t able to check in until 4:00 but they did warn us check in \u201cafter 3:00\u201d was possible. There was a strong nasty odor when we entered the condo. There were gnats and mosquitos flying everywhere upon arrival. They were in the sink, dishwasher, closets, kitchen ceiling, laundry closet, bathrooms, and bedrooms. The vinyl shower curtains were completely mildewed. We immediately called Liquid Life and asked to be moved but they had no availability. They said they would send someone out that night to spray for the bugs and to replace the vinyl shower curtains. After returning from dinner, no one had come to spray for bugs but the shower curtains had been replaced. While taking showers that night, neither tub would drain. I called again and they sent someone the next morning to snake the tubs and put a \u201ccleaner\u201d in the kitchen sink for the bugs. This didn\u2019t work on the bugs. The baseboards throughout the condo are covered in dirt. The cloth shower curtain in the master bath has either feces, dirt, blood, or makeup stains on it. The vent in the master bath has black mold and mildew all around it. There were dirty dishes in the kitchen cabinets and drawers. The cabinets felt greasy. Thankfully we brought paper plates and plastic utensils and plastic cups. The couch was covered in sand. The living room chairs are uncomfortable and grossly stained. The second bathroom toilet had to be plunged constantly. We bought a candle at Walgreens to try and drown out the smell of the condo. The carpet in the master bedroom smells like urine. The noise from upstairs was terrible. You can hear people simply walking. The noise from the pool was ridiculous and there was no privacy. There\u2019s a constant sound in the master bedroom that comes on constantly for 45 seconds and stops for 10 seconds. Almost sounds like an elevator. No idea what it is. This unit had no kitchen towels and we were given one hand towel and washcloth. Parking was sketchy and most nights we got the last spot around 9:00pm. The building needs serious maintenance and updating. Thank goodness the beds were comfortable and clean. I find it hard to believe this unit was \u201crenovated\u201d in 2020. Please do yourself a favor and google \u201cThe Palms #115 Orange Beach reviews.\u201d I wish I had. I would use Liquid Life again but I would never stay at The Palms.

Bring your own plates, cups, utensils, laundry soap, dishwasher soap, paper towels, cleaning products- including toilet paper.\nThere should be an outside shower somewhere,  but there is not.  There is an outside spigot for you to wash your feet.  There needs to be some outside hooks for hanging towels, etc.\nLet's talk about location.  The cottages are all in a row from the main street.  If you book, ask exactly how far the cottage is from the main road.  You have to walk across a very busy road to get to the beach.  The walk is fairly short, but would be a challenge for little ones.  Not sure where the pic of the road in the ad came from, but it is misleading.\nDon't bring a toddler here.

Unfortunately, they could not so the next slot available was the next business day. The other homes internet should be in range to use as well. If ever an issue, we can usually pick up from one next door or straight across.  I doubled checked our email system report status of each emails sent out to see if reported sent/viewed. All were sent out but not viewed,  so that may be to why you didn't see the information provided about the internet issue.  Also, we keep a FAQ sheet in our homes with contact number for internet on the weekends for after hour issues.  Both Ally and I were at the cottages several times over the weekend, either of us would have been more than happy to bring ice for you or ran to grab some, had we known it was an issue when dropping off other items requested. The after hour number is the best source to text or call, which is our main number. The number is also provided via emails, website, or in house information sheets for any emergency issues such as water leaks, a/c issues, electrical, or plumbing.  We will be sure to have our maintenance take a look since we are now aware its not working properly. We send out check-in instructions with list of all items to expect upon arrival, which is one set up of household items. This list can also be viewed in the rental agreement, FAQ sheet and terms and conditions as well. I will look into other ways to push the information out in the future to help clarify.  We appreciate the suggestions for the outdoor items and will relay to the owners as possible items to add over the next year.\nLastly, we have several photos, videos, and detailed descriptions of our properties in order to ensure every guest is aware of locations and layout of the cottages. Our photos show different angles from different homes interior and exterior.  Video wise we have several tours of the homes and walks to the beach. The walk from the back entrance less than 2 minutes and from the front entrance 1 minute and 30 seconds. Upon arrival at the red light to cross over, the city installed a cross walk, revamped the side walk area which is over 6ft wide, and dropped the speed limit to 25 mph to ensure safety for all crossing to beach areas. Again we do our best to portray our properties as is and to provide more than adequate information readily available on several platforms for viewing.

In addition, the sales team has gotten to know my parents over the years and is quite good at knowing which properties will fit their needs.\n\nHere are my two biggest complaints: 1.

We apologize for only having one elevator, but unfortunately the elevator was severely damaged in Hurricane Sally.  We were not able to get the correct parts very quickly, due to supply lines being down.  We have now completed our Maintenance on the elevator and it is back up and running as of January 8th.  I apologize for the delay and inconvenience.\n2.  As for the lighting, I had the Facilities Maintenance Manager inspect it this morning.  He stated that all non working exterior lights have been replaced and are now currently working.  Again, I apologize for this and I really appreciate you bringing it to our attention.\nIf you have any other questions or issues that we can help with, please email us at info@brettrobinson.com and put ATTN:  Melissa in the subject line.\nWe appreciate yall, and we will do what ever is necessary to make your parents stay a wonderful vacation.\nBest Regards,\nMelissa"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04b30bef84b7:0x239614a30c0c2e51"}

Overall I cant say a whole lot about the accommodations. When we booked the room, being as it is to sleep up to 6/7 people, we were told that two parking spots came along with the booking. When we got there to check in, we found out that we had to pay additional fees for any vehicles. Not a single one was included in the booking cost. Not even 24 hours in we had problems with the room keys not wanting to let us in. Some times it would blink red, sometimes it didnt register at all. We had to go to the office 4/5 times to fix the issue. Finally they replaced the batteries in the main lock. The office staff was rude, pissy, and didnt have much interested in helping their guest. Lastly, upon leaving, we did the courteous thing by sweeping majority of the tracked in sand up,  wiped down counters, made sure all dishes had been ran and washed, and so forth. Left, turned out keys in. And headed home. Today May 31st we are charged $110!! after speaking with someone at anchor, who didnt know why, she contacted the condo then gave us a call. These people are trying to say that they have pictures of ashes and cigarettes butts all over the room, and claiming they had to strip everything down due to the smell of smoke. Mind you we have small children in this room under the age of 5!!!!! Not once was a cigarette brought into that room and we are extremely disappointed with the way this is going. Might I add we were also charged another $40 for them to wash the comforter! The cleaning policy clearly says fresh linens are included and any additional cleaning will be extra. There was not reason to be charged extra! We will be doing everything in our power to have our bank reverse the charges as they are FAULTY!!!

The lady from housekeeping came took the dishes apologized and explained they had a lot of new kids working and that stuff was missed, she was great. She gave us the phone number for the building manager and when the situation was explained to her and the problems especially with Dawn her response was \"you really wouldn't stay here again because of 1 person\" no honey it's the dirty dishes, stinky room, gritty bed, broke door locks, broke balcony door, bad wifi, and broke phone that's the reason we would never stay at a Brett Robinson rental again the rude employes is just the cherry on top!

We spent days trying to find the perfect place on the beach at a reasonable price.\n\nI think we found that place. We rented unit 879 of Island Winds West from Brett/Robinson, and couldn't be happier. They really eased some of the worries we had with some of the other property rental places nearby.\n\nWe booked less than two weeks before our vacation, and we still only had to pay a deposit ahead of time. Other places we checked out required the full payment.\n\nThe unit itself is almost perfect. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is mainly due to the low water pressure. Maybe this is normal on the island; we're not too sure. The shower in the master bedroom had the worst of it.\n\nThe other negative is the washer/dryer combo. We couldn't figure out which was punching holes in our clothes... Also, my wife mentioned some dust on the pictures, but I didn't notice them myself.\n\nAnd I should probably mention the Wi-Fi. Each unit seems to have their own Wi-Fi, but are probably all feeding into one network. I ran a speed test on it and only recorded 1Mb of download speed. This resulted in Netflix buffering every once in a while. You can forget about streaming anything in HD...\n\nBut who goes to the beach to stay in all the time?  Everything else really is perfect. The kitchen is fully stocked with dishes and utensils. Just bring your groceries. We even had enough dishwasher detergent for a couple of days.\n\nAnd the view.... To wake up and sit on the balcony and watch the ocean... It is amazing. We even slept with our window open so we could fall asleep listening to the waves.\n\nAnd speaking of sleep, I invited my parents to come stay with us, and we still were all able to sleep comfortably. My parents moved the twin beds together and my two toddlers slept on the pull out sofa bed.\n\nSo, over all we're having a great time at IWW-879. We will more than likely rent from Brett/Robinson again. Hopefully we can find that 5 star condo next time. I will be posting pics to my Google+ profile for everyone to check out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04b30bef84b7:0x239614a30c0c2e51"}
