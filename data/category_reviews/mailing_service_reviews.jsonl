The lady behind her was smirking and making wierd giggling noises during the entirety of this conversation.\nI cannot believe they still have jobs. It is not everyone else's fault they have had such poor lives and are miserable. They are always rude. Everytime I go in for any reason. I can deal with the fact they dont take credit cards, which, let's be honest, old lady time back there is still using up her WW2 sugar rations at Delchamps and has no clue what a credit/debit card is. I'm sure they give their grandkids (Hopefully for children across the world these women dont have any) $2 and tell them not to spend it all in one place and put NECCO wafers in their stockings with a good old fashion fruit cake bar. Maybe even socks if they're lucky.\nListen everyone has bad days but this is every single time. Either to me, my wife, my neighbors, or all the other people putting up reviews.\nSo, I am going to go in there constantly and make their lives even more miserable. Asking stupid questions, talking extremely slow, paying for everything with dimes and nickels, praising Barack Obama and anything else I think will make them hate me more. Lol, I'm going to enjoy every minute I'm in there. They want me to go to FEDEX? Heck no, I love you ladies so much, I'll be coming in even more now!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430b86d8dfa7:0x7cc9a9cdc1971003"}

Staff are friendly and responsive,  but it seems they have no experience or training in using any of their computer software ... even the resident \"graphic artist\". The graphic artist wasn't attentive at all to the clear descriptions I had in my email for what I wanted, and it seems the computer itself may be unable to handle the graphics software requirements.\n\nAfter emailing my images and card descriptions, and feeling very positive about the response I received, I arrived to check on the test prints. They were terrible. The original image had been completely changed - apparently a misunderstanding from the email, but I can't see how someone could interpret it so wildly different. I said nothing about changing my own images.\n\nI had a secondary image I wanted on the back of the card, and for some reason the staff stretched the image out of shape and also completely redid the text in the image for no reason. Let me be clear that the image was a jpg format so, to redo the text, the staff had to take it upon themselves to either cut it out from the image and warp it into its new position, or plaster new text on top of it and resave as a new jpg - not at all a simple, trivial mistake. I mentioned this as I watched the staff work with it at the computer, and it was clear they didn't know what \"aspect ratio\" was, or how to resize anything to maintain the aspect ratio, and they also kept working with the bad version they'd redone, instead of the original one I wanted.\n\nIt seems the only print software they \"know\" how to use is the standard Windows photo printing interface. If you've ever used this yourself, you know it's as simplistic as you can get and not the best software for sizing and placing images exactly where you want them, unless you know what you're doing. The staff did not know what they were doing, even to print the right things on the right sides of the paper. And this was the software they wanted to use to size and place images on paper to create my card. What kind of professional printing service uses the barebones Windows software to print ANYTHING??? This is not creative software! This isn't even appropriate printing software unless you're desperate or want only the most simplistic results. Utterly embarrassing.\n\nAfter several minutes of watching the staff stretch and squeeze my image in one program, fail to print at the right size via Windows print, and then try to open up another program supposedly to edit further (and fail because the computer simply wasn't going to open the program), I decided I could do better at home. I also learned that even though the staff said I could provide the text for the inside of the card and they would pick the font and arrange it for me (as you do when you're a print shop), this is an extra charge of something like $10. I was told that if I wanted to save that extra charge, I needed to format the words and everything myself and save it as an image, so the sum total of their responsibility would be printing images and not messing with text. I was also told that if they had to resize any of the images (like they were trying and failing to do) that was also a charge of $10. What graphic artistry does that entail? Who knows. Resizing images is also par for the course for printing cards, and should be free, along with arranging text. But it's not, so YOU need to do all the leg work by making sure your images are the \"right size\" for printing ahead of time. That's right, your jpg on the computer must be sized at 5 inches ahead of time, by yourself, to print on a 5 inch card. Nevermind that the print shop is in the best position to actually control the physical print size and all you should need to do is send a high quality image.\n\nPaper choices are run-of-the mill and nothing special. Will never print anything here for any reason.\n\nTo be clear, I don't blame the staff; they did their best. I blame the owners. Train your people.
