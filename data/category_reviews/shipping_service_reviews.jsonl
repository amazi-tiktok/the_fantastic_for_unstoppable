You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

Our records indicate that you\u2019ve shipped two packages with us in as many years. One internationally, yes - we must ask questions about your shipment. \u201cWhat are you sending? What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I own a small business that I run out of my home in McMullen Cove (and yes, I do have a license with the City of Huntsville).  I mail packages on a daily basis.  Today, I missed my mail pick up and our local post office had already closed so we drove down to this store so that we could ensure our packages would go out today.  My 12 year old went in first and was refused service.  So, I then took the packages and went inside only to be told that, \"I don't receive anything from the Post Office for compensation and am not required to provide service to you.\"   I asked for her to put that in writing, she refused, spewed some other nastiness until 2 other individuals came in and I told her I would be reporting her to the proper authorities and I left.   As I type this, I am still shaken, that this kind of bigotry and hatred can still exist.  That people feel they have the right to treat others with such vile.  I will not be returning to this location ever and would strongly urge others to also find somewhere else to spend your hard earned money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533411883334, "text": "Wow, I feel I have to respond to this - this goes beyond misleading and is simply a lie.

We really try hard to make every customers experience here a very good one. As I explained to you when you were here - your postal labels would not scan. I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan. Again, I'm sorry that you are not happy, but please don't make a racial issue out of a situation that race simply had no bearing. That is extremely sad.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan.

We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

Since, he didnt' want to mess up my lawn mower, he asked me if I could call the reschedule the delivery. When I called, I got a gentleman who said well who forgot to put a pallet under it, sir idk, I don't work for you guys. He said you don't have a man at home that can just take it off off the truck, I said no sir, don't know any man strong enough to unload a  zero turn lawn mower in a crate by himself. He goes and you don't have a fork lift, again no sir, don't have one of those lying around either. He goes well guess I don't have a choice but to bring it back in and put a pallet under it, this is just rediculous. I am sorry to be a bother, but it is now day two of it suppose to be delivered and I still have no lawn mower and no contact from this company. I had to pay freight and they wanted me to do the work to unload their mistake. I called the company and was advised that my lawn mower was sitting waiting to be re loaded, but they couldn't tell me when this might happen or when it would be delivered. I don't want a phone call from this company to just give me more excuses or ask me if I could that fork lift or hulk of a man to do their job.

Jenkins walked through the apartment, asked about each item to be moved, and there and then formulated a plan to move each item in the right order. The entire crew then worked with purpose in clearing the apartment.\n\nAlso worth a mention is how respectful they were--not just in their bearing, attitude, and speech, but also in the way they treated our property. The move covered only a short distance, but the team did not take any shortcuts in transport, using the full range of blankets, pads, ropes, and other restraints to make sure the items did not move, scratch, or break during transport.\n\nFinally, other than an hour break for lunch (for which we were not charged), the entire group worked diligently until the entire truck was unloaded.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889176e57b14ddd:0x1b664f72e5c57b81"}

Please refer to your copy of the move sheet and your copy of the damage report stating 2-3 business days. On the 3rd business day, we explained to you that the replacement was delayed due to business closures related to the current pandemic, and that we would continue working diligently to complete the replacement. We regretted that the accident occurred and expected the matter to be resolved the following Monday or Tuesday.\nDespite your sense of urgency, we attempted to contact you every day for 6 days to schedule delivery. On Saturday, you returned our call, and on Monday we delivered your table. As a courtesy, we delivered the table to an address unrelated to your move, an hour round trip from our office.\nYour claim that one of the men said, \u201cthat\u2019s ok, we\u2019ll milk the clock and make the best of it\u201d is absurd nonsense. The 2 matters are unrelated, and no one stands to gain anything by making your move take longer than it should. If you would like your moves to take less time, consider reserving an apartment on the main level, and reserve your storage on the main level.\nThis move and your previous move conducted by the same movers both took 5 hours. Both moves took less time than we would expect. Perhaps their performance is the cause for you to use our service again. We are truly sorry for whatever happened to cause you to post such an untruthful and deceptive review, but we wish you the best and hope you get through it."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889176e57b14ddd:0x1b664f72e5c57b81"}

I own a business just down the street from them and have seen them driving through the neighborhood for years, first of all I have NEVER in the years I've seen their trucks multiple times a day had a negative thought about their driving.\n\nSo I hired them to do a small move for a friend who lives out in pinson so I was worried about price due to drive times. This is maybe the 7th time I've used movers, first with them. The guys got there before me and we're already a third of the way through the move before I even showed up minutes after them.\n\nMy friend who was moving was very stressed and the guys set her at ease. They grabbed everything, they would ask about anything that they had questions about, recommended we put a couple of loose pieces of art in the car for extra safety, and made sure everything was nicely packed in the truck. They were legit jogging back and forth from truck to house. And even pointed out a couple things that we missed that needed to go.\n\nWhen they got to the next location they dove into the work. Again unloading fast (but safely) and putting each thing where they needed to go. Making sure that odd and important things were set aside or noted. On top of that the guys did a great job with my friends 4 kids and her mom that were at the house! The guys put them all at ease and engaged with them happily!\n\nAnd the thing that I personally liked the most due to my line of work was how good they were with the family dogs. They were aware of the little one running around and were sure they were clear when doing anything. Justin and Tyler were HANDS DOWN the best moving crew I've used. And (I probably shouldn't mention this because they're bosses will see lol) because of their hustle it ended being a little cheaper than I expected.

I have seen some sorry movers in my day.  From the first phone call, MoveDaddy was different.  Relaxed and helpful on the scheduling, actual customer care in a time period that it is dead in America.  Rain was imminent on the scheduled day and I called them several times that week stressed out about it.  They said they would gladly move in the rain if we had to but could easily reschedule if needed.  They gave me the option of Friday afternoon or Saturday morning, no worries.  Sat morning came and two polite bright eyed men showed up right on time.  They were eager to get started and worked diligently to protect our things and move quickly.  They actually ran out of the truck back into the house to get another load, actually ran.  They had to move several awkward things, including a very heavy sofa over a rail to the bottom floor, did so with precision and care.  They moved artwork and TVs, all came out perfect.  They showed great respect and patience with my wife as to where she wanted things.  It was a hot long day and they still ran out of the house back to the truck for another load as the move was winding down.  Polite the whole time.  Their names were Matt and Justin.

I called around to several moving companies prior to Movedaddy and was less than impressed with the fact that I was not guaranteed arrival within a specific timeframe, not to mention the job date was more than a month out with other companies, namely those having a cartoon logo, sons, and transfer in their names. Other companies made me (and my family) feel like a number and insecure about booking with them. Movedaddy took special care and provided a very customer-centric approach to our relocation. Not only were they punctual, they were also very polite, respectful, and communicative with respect to determining the logistics of our move. We have heavy, oversized antique heirloom furniture and had packed over 200 boxes from our previous 4-bedroom house. Tyler and Theo provided the utmost and outstanding customer service by ensuring every piece of furniture and miscellaneous item was carefully, neatly, and brilliantly packed. My wife and I were so impressed, and frankly inspired, by how fit these young guys are, as they literally ran (sprinted) back to the truck non-stop to grab another item in this hot summer weather. Tyler and Theo are absolute beasts...thanks a million guys!!! We will always recommend Movedaddy to our friends and family. The one-star reviews from the Amacher family or any others representing less than 5-star ratings are obviously hateful, unappreciative, spiteful, etc., and should be absolutely disregarded.

The movers took almost thirteen hours to move a two bedroom apt. into a house. I witnessed the slow pace myself.  By nightfall (9 pm), a replacement (and more efficient) crew had to come to complete the job. The owner should stick to the facts that the move was poorly executed. It happens sometimes.  If I had to use Move Daddy after the move I witnessed, I 'd be less inclined to do so.  Countess request for a refund has little to do with race and everything to do with poorly executed service. I was delighted to read about the owners donation to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, but I'm confused because poor service does not equal racial disparity. Wouldn't it have been easier to simply give a refund to the customer.  The owners gesture shows how racist he really is...His 2600 dollar donation shows guilt and malice toward the customer.

Channel 6 receives more complaints about this company than any other.  Good reviews are done by employees and family members.\n\nRESOLUTION has NOT been reached with this company!  FRAUDULENT business practices!  It does NOT take 14 HOURS ($1600) to move someone from a 2 bdrm apt 12 miles away. No packing involved!\n\n1.  A refund is  DEFINITELY JUSTIFIED!  It is the ONLY resolution to the primary complaint; I was OVERCHARGED!  The company's workers intentionally \"rode\" the clock and took extended breaks and lunches that I paid for.  MoveDaddy's LACK of INTEGRITY and PROFESSIONALISM is palpable.\n2. It is unacceptable to wait for compensation for the damaged furniture.  As a good faith effort, this part of the dispute should be addressed immediately and separately.\n3. The donation to the Civil Rights Institute is NO CONSEQUENCE to this claim.  The fact that the owner, Richard McBee, offered to make a donation to an African-American entity is patronizing and dismissive.  This dispute is about POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE and POOR BUSINESS PRACTICES!  The owner's donation offer is indicative of his own internal conflict with being a racist.\nThe RESOLUTION is to refund me 8.5 hours that your were overcompensated due to your employees extended breaks and lunches.  Second part of resolution is to compensate me for damaged property. REFUND me my money!\n\n## UPDATE## Active BBB Complaint.   This complaint is about MoveDaddy's POOR DELIVERY of CUSTOMER SERVICE and POOR business practices!! Richard McBee's employees were taking extended breaks, lunches and being preoccupied on their cellphones while on the clock resulting in a 14 hour move that should have taken 5 hours or less.   I am willing to compromise and compensate you for 5 hours at $118 per hour.  I am requesting a refund of the other 8.5 hours plus the cost of a damaged chair estimated at $595 for replacement.\n\nThe owner, Richard McBee, did not provide me with a resolution!  I asked for a refund or at least a compromise for the POORLY executed services I received. Instead of providing me with a comparable resolution, the owner donated money to an institution that has NOTHING to do with this business transaction.    POOR service on this date was evident!  The movers took almost 14 hours to move a two bedroom apt. into a house 30 mins away.  There was NO packing involved...just loading and unloading.  The owner's $2600 donation shows guilt and malice towards the customer.  I understand that companies have bad days.  How those missteps are handled determines the company's value.  Donating money to a non-affiliated business is NOT a resolution to my business transaction.\n\nPlease note: It is a nice gesture to donate money; however, the BHM Civil Rights Center has NOT received any donation from you or your company per company representative.\n\n***UPDATE:  I have FILED a COMPLAINT with the BBB and BCA.\n\nDo NOT hire this company!!  They charged me $1600! The move was absolutely horrendous!!. Zack (with the locks) stayed on his phone the entire time. It took them 14 hours to move me!!!   I was charged $1600 for a move from a 2 bedroom apartment to a house 30 mins away.  Zack was completely belligerent when asked to complete the job and get off his cellphone.   I had to threaten to call the POLICE in order to remove him from my property. This took 14 hours and the job still was never completed. The company had to call in another truck to help the other 2 workers. My furniture was not put together. My house was left in shambles. The manager/owner Jared was UNPROFESSIONAL and rude!  Incorrect hookup in laundry caused my washer to leak in the laundry room. This crew was quite inexperienced and rude. Second crew was called in to complete unpacking!  Second crew finished unpacking within 1.5 hours. They never completed putting items together.  They offered to come back the next day and charge me again. Overall, a HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE!!

She told me that this was unacceptable and that they don't box things at the post office they only ship them and that may be true but I wasn't asking her to package anything I simply wanted to purchase the boxes and borrow her tape to close the boxes and put my label onto the boxes. She acted like I was the worst person in the world just because I wanted to borrow her tape and instead of letting me borrow them she snatched the box and taped it herself. She treated me so badly it almost brought me to tears but I held my head high! Maybe I was a little ignorant as to how to ship but she's a Federal Employee she is paid to help people when they are unsure of what to do. There were a few of her regulars in line behind me that giggled when she talked down to me, I've never been so humiliated in my life. It was THAT bad.

I called to let customer service know that the address was correct and asked if the drive could call me and I was help them find my house or meet them to get may package which I need very badly. I waited for a phone call that I was told I would receive before 8pm while waiting at the front window of the house so I would see truck if it passed. I never received the call. At 9pm I received a notification saying that the package couldn\u2019t be delivered because a signature was required and that the delivery is rescheduled for the following week. The driver was in the wrong here again too be cause the drive never came back to the house. Like I said earlier, I was waiting and never saw or heard anyone. There was NO note for a delivery attempt. I even checked my cameras to find that no one stoped by. Now because of a drivers negligence, I\u2019m losing money on a job that I am unable to perform due to the part that was supposed to be delivered. I\u2019m losing way more money than what it will take to pay the drive overtime and fuel to drive out here again.\n\nThis is very poor business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603596119573, "text": "We apologize your experience at this location did not meet your expectations.

Overlooking the fact that they delivered to the wrong house, that house had a carport they could have left the package under, and with it being the holidays and people stealing packages being a common occurrence, leaving any packages out in the open like that when there's the option of a carport is ridiculous. Lazy delivering by people who obviously can't be bothered to do their job. I understand there's a good chance it was a seasonal worker but there's no excuse.

Giving the benefit of the doubt, I called Fedex to let them know I need that pack THE DAY IT WAS SCHEDULED and that THEIR DRIVER is the one that failed to read clearly marked signs on where to deliver it. Neither UPS or USPS and any issues delivering. They sent the local hub the message that we needed the package that day. I scheduled this 15 mins after I got the delivery exception. The driver couldn't have been very far away at this time. After 5 o'clock I called again and basically said that they were not delivering it and that I could not pick it up until the next day. If I needed it the next day, that's when I would have scheduled the delivery. FedEx basically told me they don't care that it was their fault my package wasn't in my hand and they weren't going to do anything about it. Talk about great customer service.

If so, get a prepaid label and drop it off, it\u2019s just way too expensive. USPS prices are pretty standard so if sending Priority Mail just use a flat rate and ship from there.\n\nOutside shipping they have a great mail box service that will allow you to get an address that isn\u2019t a PO Box but functions just like one.
