Never recommend and never use again.\n\n****ADDITIONS OR RESPONSES after owner response. The Rep referred to was not your wife, but the \"contractor\" that he said he was doing our carpet.

For anyone reading this....please visit our about us page on our website...https://www.goprosteam.com/about-us/   as you can see Cams' picture and bio are listed and have been on our website for years. Stacy, this is tiring to say the least.  Let me fill you in on a little nugget of information...the technician is not only our employee he is my stepson, so I think we know a thing or two that goes on in our company.  I mean for goodness sake Stacy...we have company vans with our logo, company name, address and phone number plastered all over it with an expensive van wrap...do you think any company is gonna let a \"contractor\" drive their company vans?  They are not, so again, either you are confused or making this stuff up for whatever reason you have...not sure...maybe you are just having a bad week...still no reason to dump all over us. The reason you were required to pay upfront is because both you and your husband were leaving the house, this is company policy..otherwise if a customer stays they pay after work is completed.  Also...if Cam left a busines card with our logo all over it, it says his title \"OPERATIONS MANAGER\".  We have already asked Cam about his experience with you, as a matter of fact the only communication he had with you was on the phone when he called to ask a few directions to your home while he was on the way...you were not even there when the cleaning intially started, your husband was...so no Cam has no reason to tell you he is a contractor.  By the way....you did not pay Cam, he carries a credit card reader that is mobile, you were charged by my company...would you like to see a copy of the receipt?  Ive been more than nice to you over this but you keep making false claims.  Again I appreciate your business but please stop this...it is making you look foolish.  Once again we wish you all the luck in your new home.\n\nHi Stacy.  This is Matt Lowery, co owner and founder of Pro Steam Carpet Care.  First let me say it is unfortunate that you feel the need to leave such a false review of our company.  Secondly here is the url to our about us page on our website  https://www.goprosteam.com/about-us/  as you can see it has Cams' bio on there and states he is our OPERATIONS MANAGER, not a contractor so let me clear some things up for you.  Firstly...the \"rep\" on the phone is my wife and gets compliments daily on how helpful, resourceful, nice and educated she is, the \"rep\" that cleaned your carpet and furniture is an employee and has been employed with us for 8 years with zero complaints, only praised because he cares.  We are a family owned business and have been for 30 years.  Secondly...you claim we \"contract\"  for our work....sorry but that is false and misleading.  We do not use contractors..we use employees.  We refused to send a different technician because your husband called us approx 4 days after the job was completed and after you had moved in due to a \"stain\" reappearing.  We were more than happy to reservice your carpet at no charge but the technician who originally cleaned your carpet was already familiar with your carpet and had absolutely no problem in returning to satisfy you....I found it odd that your husband called back and canceled the reservice of your carpets.   We do have before and after pics of your furniture, they are like night and day and cleaned up perfectly.  If I am able to post the pics to this response I will.  I do however have a suspicion that since we performed the carpet cleaning BEFORE you moved in that during your moving process there was probably some soiling that occured....this is common, however it is still unfortunate you feel the need to leave a 1 star review.  We agreed to return to reservice your area and you refused.  We are a good, generous and honest company with many certifications and one of the only firms that is insured in the area.  We appreciate your business and wish you luck with your new home."}, "gmap_id": "0x88f5952399cc1ad9:0x87abb5071354d46d"}

I had friends stuck at my house during the height of COVID-19 with their 2 dogs.  Four animals in an 1100 sqft house for 7 months.  You get the picture.  Guest just left last month and I am still trying to clean up after all have left.  So I decided to refinance my house.  Then I received a call that my home needed an appraisal for my refinance.  Ok, no big deal, except the appraiser would be here in 1 week.  I needed my carpets cleaned FAST.  Panic set in when ALL my normal carpet cleaners in Newnan were unavailable until after appraisal date.  So, I searched for companies in LaGrange and read the reviews.\nPro Steam seemed like the best option.  I called and Ali was able to get me on their schedule same week.   Price was affordable, in my budget and primarily fit my time constraints.  Cam arrived on time, went over the house and was very thorough.   I really appreciated how quick Ali was able to get me scheduled due to extremely tight timeline. I was amazed that the products they used smelled refreshing AND DID NOT bother my sinuses at all!!!   That is saying something because glass cleaner will make my nose burn.  My carpets look like new, all the little \"oops\" stops are gone, house smells AMAZING.   Cam was here about 2 hours and I was able to continue working while my carpets were cleaned, even had a few calls and no issues at all with noise.\nSo, if you are looking for carpet cleaners, this local owned company is AWESOME!!!
