My boyfriend used to do business with this place and has an abundant of stories involving the cleanliness of this establishment. One story being he came across a dead rat on the floor. Another being that they never clean anything where the biggest problem is the cross  contamination. He witnessed almost all employees not wearing gloves in the kitchen Let's just say I'm happy I've learned about this information so I don't ever eat there and thus why I am letting people know.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a61fc3aa42d75:0x59ad35aa32905b9c"}

I'm standing in the freezing cold weather and when I told the lady I tried to call way before 2 but noone would answer the phone so if she had 30ty pounds for this lady why couldn't she manage to let me buy 3 pounds and it was Christmas Eve and she really needs to be a better employee for yall so you don't loose customers because I will never buy anything from this place again . Ok rant over just thought I'd share with the people of Bay Minette  that this lady was rude and did not have the spirit of Christmas or even had a kind heart for people wanting to pay money for the seafood ..

I said I wasn't told and she proceeds to move things off the counter and snarky says that there was a sign right here.  I will not be back. Customer service is horrible.

I purchased a good selection of meats, and we have not been disappointed. The hamburger meat is awesome, taste like it doesn't even have any fillers, almost like ground steak! Gary and his wife offer a nice clean store, along with an excellent variety of meat options, and at a lower price than most local stores. The trip to Rainsville is well worth the quality and the price savings.
