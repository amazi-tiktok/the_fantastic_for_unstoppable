Before this incident I reached out to the department on several occasions about concerns about my son's mother being on drugs and also living conditions with no power, water or food. The department seemed to share no concern for this and their only solution was to close the case after not being able to locate my son or his mother. I filled 2 different police reports after finding bruising and clear signs of neglect finally pushing the department to take some sort of action. After a month of consistent phone calls they were able to reach my son's mother where she was arrested for obstruction and outstanding warrants. They were also able to verify living conditions, no food, water, etc. Later, I was told my son couldn't be placed with me because I lived in Ga, but foster care seemed like a better choice. I was told on this day I would get visitation every other weekend as well as being able to speak to my son over the telephone until they could file necessary paper work in Ga which after a week they still haven't done. On my first visit this previous weekend my son arrived with bruising over his legs and arms, un cut nails and hadn't looked like he had bathed for some time. After my visit I brought up these concerns to the case worker Alisa Colley, she seemed to have little compassion and almost seemed annoyed of my concerns. I was also asked to sign forms without any consent from an attorney when I was only there to spend quality time with my son. After being bombarded with forms that I insisted I wasn't comfortable signing without legal counsel the case worker Alisa contacted the supervisor Angie to speak with me. Once on the phone I was told if I didn't sign I wouldn't get any more visits with my son. When trying to explain I didn't understand what I was signing and bringing up clear signs of abuse and neglect of my son while in the departments care Angie continued to scream and yell at me where I couldn't get any words in. After the short phone call of abusive behavior and language I was told my visit was over and have not had any contact with my son over the last few days. I have made a report internally about these concerns and have plans to open a civil suit against the department.  I find it unjustified and unconstitutional for a department that's employed by tax payer dollars to feel they're above the law and act in the manner of which they did. The only people that will suffer is the children that they are sworn to protect.
