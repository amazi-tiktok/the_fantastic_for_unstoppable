My local mechanic changed out the catalytic converter, but the light came back on (was not a Porsche cat). He next put the old cat back on, refunded me the money, and tested and changed the oxygen sensors. Still, the light came back on after driving it about 50 miles. He suggested I go to a Porsche dealer. (In hindsight, I wish we would have left the other cat on that he put on in the first place, but we were troubleshooting, and this stuff is expensive anyway.) I took it to Jack Ingram Porsche. They put on a Porsche cat (still expensive, paying for the Porsche name) but I\u2019ve gone over 100 miles now without the light coming back on. The original code was for a bank 2 catalytic converter. Before this, I only went 30 to 50 miles before the CEL light came back on. So, I have hope that the Porsche cat fixed the problem, along with the new oxygen sensors (which the old ones were visibly defective). The dealership worked with me pretty well, as I live an hour and a half away. I dropped it off on a Sunday.  It stayed the week until they could get the parts. It then took me a couple days before I could come get the car. The only thing I could say as far as improving service was that sometimes they were busy and it took a while before they would call me back. However, the other staff relayed messages and helped arrange for me to pick it up after the service department was closed, because that\u2019s when I could make it to the dealership.

Not only did the folks at Birmingham Porsche help me coordinate shipping delivery straight to their service department, but they immediately got the car in and did a full PPI on it, and produced a detailed report of everything that needs to be done.  Throughout the process, they gave me multiple different recommended options, and were consistently friendly, courteous, and kind.  For instance, the engine is due for a rebuild.  But I just can't financially swing it right now.  Instead of ANY hint of judgment or pushiness, they were completely understanding, and were like, \"Don't worry AT ALL - just bring it back in when you're ready!\"  :-)  In particular, Rodney and Tracy went out of their way to take phenomenal care of me and my car - treating me throughout as if I was a millionaire owner of a new 918 rather than a UAB Professor with an old 911.  I cannot begin to tell you how much it means to me to have guys who truly LOVE these cars - and are dedicated to taking meticulous care of them - right here in town.  They will be the ONLY ones who handle my \"baby\" from now on.  You can trust your beloved Porsches to them as well!\n\nREVIEW #2:  For some jank reason, Google won't allow you to post MULTIPLE reviews, even if you have multiple EXPERIENCES to share, so I'm doing it this way.  I was driving my 911 around town, and started feeling my right heel slip on my floormat.  If you're an old-school Porsche owner, you immediately know that this can only mean ONE thing: master brake cylinder.  :-(   Sure enough, got home, put my hand on the mat, and it came up shiny and wet.  SAD FACE.  Immediately took it to Porsche Birmingham.  Figured they wouldn't be able to get to it for days, but instead they had it checked out within 24 hours, even though I (obviously) hadn't created an appointment in advance.  Two days later a new master cylinder had been installed.  When I picked up my baby, I was STUNNED to see that the floormat had been STEAM-CLEANED - along with the PASSENGER one as well.  They even DRIED them, prior to my pickup!  It's the little things, people, that speak to quality in service.  When asked about it, both Rodney and Tracy were like, \"We didn't want your mats to be soiled!\"  Exactly: thoughtful, considerate, and meticulous.  A++ Folks.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-R-4RptlePYXBACBdoq5VNLFdezXxU8j87dxF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2_7VWRIdxYRAoV6n2r9bi4O3LxLsxDSvJhU1N=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889117dca6bc5eb:0x58c749fe1353fe82"}

Well I feel I have been misjudged. They should at least have had the decency or courtesy to let me know that, An email or a phone call would have been nice and I could have paid cash for the car if they would have at least contacted me.

Most people might go 1 star but for the sake of transparency and benefit of the doubt I'm giving them 3 stars. Don't get me wrong I would recommend this dealership to anybody. Please read along and I'll explain why and maybe future clients/customer can learn from my experience.\nMy sales guy was Bart. And he was excellent. I'll give him 5 stars if I have to rate him alone. Make the story a little shorter, I made an offer to buy their Cayman. Was not accepted nor rejected. After a few days, the listing went down lower than what I offered.\nCalled them immediately and asked them why it was listed lower than my offer. Was told it was a mistake, which was fine by me. Some may think otherwise. The next day Bart called me telling me that they want to maintain the integrity of the company and wanted to offer my the lower listed price instead of my offer. I was ecstatic. They didn't have to do that. They could've  said, it was a mistake but they'll take my first offer. I salute them for that especially Bart who made it happen.\nNow, I sent all my info for financing so I will know what's my APR and I can decide if I'll try my bank here in Florida if I can find a lower rate before I fly to Birmingham to get the car.  Finance manager Katie called me and said my APR was 3.18%. (Btw, my credit score was 821).  I know I heard it right because I made her tell me my monthly payments and wrote it on paper.  I wanted  my monthly payment to be at 550 per month. When I asked what is the payment if I put 13k down payment, it was way lower, around 539 per month, so I asked her what if it's 12k down payment, she said it was 556 per month which is where I wanted to be. Also, I'm sure it was 3.18% because I went and try the autotrader calculator if it's accurate. Put the numbers in including tax and dealers fee and It was very close to what she told me. So I accepted it. She said she's gonna get it ready when I get there. I did not bother going to my bank since I thought 3.18% was about right basing on my research with excellent credit score (821).\nI was picked up from the airport by Lee who was a great guy. Very patient, accommodating and just a very nice person. 10 stars for him if you ask me.\nNow, the surprise, upon signing of papers. The same finance manager I talked to over the phone told me my APR was 4.18%!!! Surprise!!! I told her how did it happen? She said it's been like that. I insisted and reminded her about our conversation over the phone and she offered to take off some extras to lower the payment. So now I'm paying 562 per month with my 13k down payment without extras instead of 539 per month with extras. I could've have walked out but I flew from Florida to Alabama. Also, I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she may have type a wrong number in her computer while she was on the phone with me. Still, the difference between the two APRs is 23 dollars per month x 72 months = I lost 1,656 dollars for a simple \"mistake\". I know It's not a lot of money, but very disappointing if you're expecting something different. It could be an honest mistake. I'll let the reader decide.\nThis is a great company with excellent staffs. I  still recommended them to my friend whom after driving my Cayman want to buy one too. Although,  I advised him to make sure they send him a copy of the APR agreement before flying there so there's no \"mistake\" or surprises.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889117dca6bc5eb:0x58c749fe1353fe82"}

We live 2 hours away and wanted to get as much details via phone before deciding to make the drive. While speaking with the sales manager via phone, we were assured that the vehicle was in tip top shape, excellent condition, and had been detailed, minus one small scratch on the passenger side door that they could buff out and the timing belt which hadn't been replaced (as you can tell by now, that this isn't a brand new vehicle, but it was brand new to us and our budget).  With the great phone call and all the details worked out, we were certain that this was \"The One!\" We set up an appointment and made the 2 hour road trip. We arrived on time and was told that our sales rep wasn't at work yet, so we started working with an alternate, she was pleasant.  Walking over to the vehicle, I noticed right away that this vehicle was NOT in excellent condition by any means, 3 out of the 4 rims were scuffed up pretty bad, and the 1 minor scratch had turned into 3 separate gouges on 3 different locations of the vehicle. We asked if an inspection had been performed and were assured that yes, everything worked. My husband decided to try everything out and we found that the right side blinker wasn't working. By no means was the vehicle detailed or even cleaned, gum was stuck on the side door, a sticky jam substance was on the roof lite and cd's from the previous owner were left in the glove box.  At this point I was deeply disappointed and regretted the 2 hour one way drive but I had my heart set on this particular vehicle. So, I pulled my husband aside and we agreed that if the dealership could fix those things, then we would be willing to move forward. We talked with the sales agent and she said that she completely understood and would go get the manager. During the wait, the original sales rep showed up to work and she then stated they only perform certain things because they strive to be like \"Car Max\".  At this point, I was just ready to hear what the manager said, hoping for a better outcome. The manager arrived and absolutely refused to budge on any of our requests, and basically told us that this wasn't a brand new vehicle, that they weren't doing anything. He had offered to give us $500 off for the timing belt that needed replaced which was actually a $940 part and said that we could use the money for them to buff out the rims instead but that would be it. Then proceeded to tell us that the blinker wasn't a safety issue and they would not be fixing it, nor fixing any of the gouges that were present, nor would the vehicle be cleaned. After listening to what he had to say, I gave him back the keys and we left. (I was so disappointed in not getting the car, and even more disappointed with the customer service).  Needless to say, Tom Williams Porche must only be into customers who are willing to spend the big bucks!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889117dca6bc5eb:0x58c749fe1353fe82"}
