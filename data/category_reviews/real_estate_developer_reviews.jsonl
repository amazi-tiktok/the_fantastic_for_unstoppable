They built our first house while we were in a time crunch before our first child was born.  We weren't sure if we would put roots down in the Auburn area for long so we decided to buy a starter home.  Our thought was to purchase a quality starter home from a quality builder so that in a year or two if we decided to sell, we would be able to sell the home with very little problem.  Well, we currently have our house under contract to be sold at a price well above what we payed.  We listed our house FSBO (so it was never actually \"listed\" on MLS) and it was under contract within 1 week.  I know we made a good decision choosing to buy a Holland Home.  Because we were so pleased with Daniel and Robert, we have already signed a contract for Holland Homes to build our \"forever\" home just as soon as we close on our first one.

We were first-time renters and were so excited to get to live in apartment that, to us, was really nice and affordable in a great location. We loved living at LeCraw. Despite the bug problem that we could never seem to get rid of, and the fact that our unit was the only one that didn\u2019t get renovated before we moved in, we truly enjoyed our time there.\n\nWe moved out April 13, 2018. Before our final inspection, Jessy Garver at the Thayer Properties office at the Village on Cherokee told us not to worry about being present at the inspection. She told us that if we didn\u2019t hear anything, we were good to go \u2013 her exact words (and we have a voice mail of her saying this) were \u201cno news is good news.\u201d We did not hear anything from Jessy or any other member of Thayer staff, because we left the apartment in good condition.\n\nOn April 30, we received a letter from Thayer Properties informing us that they were keeping our security deposit and that we owed an additional $288.32 for a bug infestation and carpet replacement. We immediately tried to contact Jessy and the Thayer office and were ignored.  We sent a letter registered mail (so we would get a receipt when they received it), which said that we disputed the debt and needed some documentation proving that the damages were a) as extensive as they claimed, and b) our fault. (Side note: Georgia state law mandates that if a landlord intends to keep a tenant\u2019s security deposit and/or charge them for damages, all inspections and a final list of damages must be compiled within 5 days of the tenant moving out. By the time we were informed of the \u201cdamages,\u201d more than two weeks had passed and a new tenant had been moved in. In addition, the statement we were sent was dated April 23 \u2013 I\u2019ll save you the math: that\u2019s 10 days after we moved out.) After they received the letter, we were told that all further inquiries should be directed to their lawyer, Travis Hargrove at the Finley Firm. We immediately tried to contact Travis; during our first call, Travis told us he was in his car and couldn\u2019t answer any of our questions because he didn\u2019t have any of the paperwork in front of him. He said he would call us back from his office first thing the next morning.\n\nWe never heard back from Travis. His office staff told us that he was in a meeting or mediation every time we called (we made seven attempts to call him in a single week), and when we emailed him, he said that he was on vacation and would contact us when he returned. I bet you can guess what happened next.\n\nOn May 24, my fianc\u00e9 and I each received a letter from National Credit Systems informing us that our debt had been sold and we now owed the collection agency. We sent letters back right away informing them that we disputed the debt and wanted proof: a record of the Knox Pest Control inspection that LeCraw said they ordered, proof that we damaged the carpet beyond reasonable wear, etc. We heard nothing from the debt collector or LeCraw/Thayer or Travis Hargrove for about a month. On July 19, I received a letter from National Credit Systems that said our account had been cancelled because LeCraw/Thayer was unable to provide documentation proving that we owed the debt.\n\nWhile this was all going on, I spoke to some of our friends who also lived in Thayer-owned properties (one at Hilcrest and one at the Village on Cherokee, both also college students and first-time renters), and what do you know \u2013 they were both contacted post move-out that they owed exorbitant amounts of money for damages (with no proof) and carpet replacement.\n\nTLDR: Thayer Properties is running a scam on college students and first-time renters. Living there is pretty great, but once you move out, they will accuse you of damaging the unit and will demand you pay for carpet replacement, but they will have no documentation or proof of the damages. It is NOT worth it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd278293bd42b:0x1c7f8ee163896115"}

First and most importantly, The HOA board or staff needs to work on professionalism and handling situations case by case. It clearly states in the covenants that fences will not be brought forward except in special circumstances. They would not even discuss my case, just redirected me back to the covenants like I hadn\u2019t already read them. Plus, most of the time, a fence is for privacy. I could care less about the right side of my home, but not being able to have my son\u2019s bedroom window inside the fence for security and privacy reasons is crazy to me.\nThe other thing I would greatly recommend is improving the design center/appointment. A design room where we can see EVERYTHING, and not the just basic options, would cut down on the confusion and disappointment after the home is finished. I was blindly choosing things I wouldn\u2019t have if I could\u2019ve seen what I was choosing before hand. A full design center with every option available visible to the buyer would help a lot.\nI love my home. There are major things I would do differently next time around, but overall, the quality of my home is excellent and my team was exceptional. I loved my community manager and project manager Ryan and Logan.

{"user_id": "117234347493630291856", "name": "Katelyn G", "time": 1602178484091, "rating": 2.0, "text": "Updating my final review of Davidson Homes despite their attempt to have me sign a disclosure that I will no longer say anything negative about their company since they fixed the issues. This paper also stated that since they are committed to excellent customer service that they would cover \"cosmetic\" items not normally covered. It should be very clearly stated that the items were not cosmetic and actually a manufacturing defect that never should have been approved by their supers. After nearly 10 months of owning the house, our 60 day warranty items are finally resolved.\u00a0Summary of issues that are now fixed --leaking chimney that caused severe damage upstairs and downstairs (took 7 months to be tarp free), water intrusion in the garage (claimed to not be considered a defect despite not being present in any other homes), cracked/misaligned window/door casings, manufacturer defect on marble vanity top that was supposed to be replaced before move in (attempted to not cover because it's \"cosmetic\").\n\nMy biggest frustration with them still reigns true despite the thorough completion by Chris Thompson--the amount of time and effort it took to get these things resolved is excessive and shouldn't have been necessary. The (majority of) representatives within Davidson have been friendly throughout the process including Ana Siersma, Chris Thompson, and Chad Vader. Although their production manager could use some people skills and learn to accept that in an instance such as this, the customer has every right to complain without being argued with; or without being met with rebuttals or attempted justification for all the issues or an attempt to silence their right to review. The good news for new homebuyers is that there are new managers in all departments and they will likely never need to personally interact with the production manager, but this unfortunately didn't make it any easier for all of the existing homeowners and I won't personally be able to speak on that. It may seem like I'm holding a grudge or I keep bringing up issues they fixed, and truthfully I should be allowed given the severe damage, unusability of our living spaces, and headache caused with the excessive timeline of repairs; but it's not just us with issues, I have yet to speak to a neighbor who has not had major frustrations with Davidson. So yes, I am happy that our issues are fixed, but there's no way to get rid of the bitter taste given the disaster that we were presented. However, according to a particular production manager and management who presented what can only be described as a non-disclosure since Davidson agreed to fix issues not ordinarily covered under warranty, the repairs are made so I should stop complaining. And yes, everyone has apologized profusely (some with \"buts\" attached to it) but that didn't change the outcome. And doesn't eliminate snarky comments such as \"this is why you have a home warranty\" or \"you wouldn't have been able to close on time if these were identified before\". Difference is, if we didn't close on time, it's not me, the customer, losing money having to pay a mortgage, it's Davidson.\n\nThe one thing that has been brought up multiple times (including our final meeting) that is one of my biggest annoyances is that we signed off on a preclose walkthrough stating there weren't the issues we're now pointing out. Our options on walkthrough were to accept that they're saying the work they did was satisfactory or not close on time. There was no in between, compromise, or room to question their work. It's not a good business practice to put homeowners in that situation and it's also worse that no one's really owned up to knowing/acknowledging that is an area of improvement and would rather argue the point. Maybe I have too high of standards coming from Florida where you don't have to choose the best of the worst which is what Huntsville/Madison is (not just me who has these sentiments, I promise). I hope that we can now enjoy owning this home because I really do l love our floorplan.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg74vRXko9572NJGY_DZ3QECcJ3DTnhspgfLXS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeCHolP-SAbHk1LBUMHn7H8GsRwRMwNNufF9S0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGzNTZwD9JdPQ1dF73EhYG30KnnYaXBDk7fkiC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMWgLVQ3r3XyuQO_rZLVijjjH-uXlswV8R0T-p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMedjz0c6vua5yUltOSUxvLGKRn7lZs0yw8ldmM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7N9tBJrbYYKMwNyHLPzw9Xhe3MmSVvpxfLnWW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg9dDOYNiJlIYfyTWDP5mCxqol2PyOtSz6CY4V=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0xT9ddYOcwZlXm-5KEdJeTjl790ErdKN-Igp1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyqfKx1ihP2LEt2zLvqDFs9aqRbG_YhdeWRpVA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1602184862246, "text": "Hi Katelyn,\n\nWe apologize that you feel your experience with us has been anything less than excellent.

We\u2019ve battled through this issue the entire summer and it continues today. I\u2019m tired of Davidson sending people over here who don\u2019t know anymore about the issue or resolving the issue than we do. We cannot and will not continue to have our AC down to 69\u2022 or lower to accommodate our room when it causes the rest of our downstairs to feel like an icebox.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure what was done incorrectly but we do know that something is obviously wrong and we\u2019re not sure why Davidson is not staying on top of the issue until it\u2019s resolved. We shouldn\u2019t have to keep contacting you all when you know that there\u2019s been no resolution.  Here it is at 0400 in the morning and I\u2019m awakened because of the uncomfortable, hot and muggy temperature in our bedroom as the remainder of the house is significantly cooler. The disparity is much more than just a few degrees difference from one room to the other.\n\nWe don\u2019t need anyone else to come here and to basically tell us that this is just how it is and this is normal because it\u2019s not! We\u2019ve withstood 100 plus degree weather for several months at a time in our house in Texas (temperatures were extreme) and never had this to happen. The temperature was significantly the same from one level of our house to the next; one room to the next. Similar square footage.\n\nDavidson\u2019s gotten away with putting terrible sod down in our yard and never watering or treating it but this will not be overlooked. We\u2019ve watched each and everyone of our neighbors yards get treated with the proper, upmost care for weeks at a time while we\u2019ve dealt with stony, brick laid horrible looking sod/grass. I\u2019m assuming since we didn\u2019t have a \u201cSean\u201d working on our property, we\u2019ve gotten the short end of the stick.\n\nIf we had to do it over again, we wouldn\u2019t. Starting with the initial person of contact for the build.\n\nLet us know what Davidson\u2019s plans are to rectify this situation.\n\nI must note that Ana has been the most positive experience that I\u2019ve had with Davidson thus far. I appreciate her customer service, communication, and willingness to help. I only wish that she\u2019d been the realtor (I do know that she\u2019s not a realtor) and that Sean had been the project manager when we started this venture.\n\nRegards,\nDZ\n\nThis is the email that I sent to Davidson Homes and no one has reached out to us to discuss or to resolve the issues.  Davidson has treated us more like an inconvenience than as customers. We should\u2019ve backed out of the deal when we initially started working with the realtor to build our plan but we went against our better judgement. Our options were not explained at all, nor were they laid out for us as they were for others in other Davidson builds. We were brushed off when we asked for details about upgrades or options. This has led us to make decisions based off of a lack of information and available options. The sod that they laid was ridiculous and they would not help us to get our grass up to part as they did for all of our neighbors. Unfortunately for us, we were the first to purchase and to move into our neighborhood and we\u2019re paying for it in the end. Davidson has put more care and concern in the neighboring homes and not putting any effort in meeting our needs today. Our master bedroom and bath stays very humid and hot and we have no explanation or understanding as to why it\u2019s that way. It feels like we\u2019re walking into the garage or the attic at times.\n\nWe\u2019re very disappointed in our new investment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602506039371, "text": "Hi Daphne,\n\nWe apologize that you feel your experience with us has been anything less than excellent.

This should have been brought up during the design meeting, but since it wasn't, I'm having to wire up my own connections. Not a big deal, just slightly annoying.\n\nThe bigger issue (more a problem with Heritage Mortgage) is if you're doing a VA loan, Davidson Homes / Heritage Mortgage will lie to you. They consider any VA non-allowable fees (borrower CAN'T pay) that the seller pays instead, to be a seller concession that counts toward their $3000 concession for using their services. So fees I'm not allowed to pay are somehow a \"concession\" to me. Total BS that cost me about $900. Good thing they had me fill out their survey prior to closing, because I left them a good review.

Was told a full sod back yard and the back yard has at least 4 large trees, 1 of which is a giant pine tree with limbs hanging over the house, one cluster of 12 small ones, and another cluster of 5 or so.  We asked them to let us cut the small ones and they cut the pine tree.  They told us no and we would have to wait until closing...WHEN THE BRAND NEW HOUSE IS UP!  We also explained to them that sod will not live under all of that shade, but they don\u2019t care because they aren\u2019t the ones going to live there!   Chantae lied and said the backyard would be bigger than the model home, well that might be, but a jungle was not what was represented!  She first said she didn\u2019t say that at all, then later said it was taken out of context.  They are all out to cover their own behinds.\n\nNow the windows are in, we noticed that the front window has grids.  We requested no grids at the design meeting.  We asked about it today, they said that the front window having grids is standard and there would have had to been an up charge to have no grids on that window.  This was NEVER mentioned before when we requested to have NO GRIDS.  Logan with Davidson Homes told us we can just go to Wilson Lumber when the house is closed on and buy a new  insert without grids and pop the glazing bead out to change it out ourselves. Once again taking no responsibility for it themselves.  Customer service isn\u2019t even in their vocabulary.

Out of all their models, I think it has the best and most affordable floor plan. I really enjoyed the experience of being able to choose all the colors and our new home consultant Chantae did an amazing job at providing her input and answering any questions we had. We also chose to use Davidson\u2019s provided realtor (which is free) and the realtor was super helpful (USE THEIR REALTOR). She updated us on the progress of the house and took videos and pictures. For the most part, everything was smooth and easy... almost too easy. The construction manager, Jerry, was very helpful and took his time to insure the house was closed and finished in a timely manner, all while insuring the tegrity and quality of the house was up to par.\n\nCONS: We visited the house several time to insure changes we made were being implemented. (Took the advice from another review and I\u2019m glad we did.) There were several key features and changes we had asked for that were being overlooked on the addendum. I think the root of the issue was due to our construction managers changing, however be mindful if you do have a lot of add-on and changes, try and check up on the house once a week or so.\n\nWHAT I WOULD CHANGE: There were things that I feel should be standard that weren\u2019t such as: numbers on the house other than just on the mailbox, a garbage disposal, gutters, and window screens (all can be added for extra cost).  There should be a choice as to what the \u201cplant package\u201d includes. The randomization is pretty... random and the plants were basically dead by move in time.\n\nIn all, the experience with Davidson was fun and exciting. You can tell that the people you work with along the way really care about their job and about you.

On my pre sheet rock walk through i reached beneath the vapor barrier in the master bathroom tub and shower area and presented Mr. Chandler with soaking wet insulation that was still in the wall. At that time Mr. Chandler removed and replaced the insulation in the bathroom. Items that were pointed out to Mr. Chandler prior to the pre sheet rock walk through with Lou and Scott Gallimore were not corrected and had to be pointed out again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886280bed8be8e63:0x676f1cf11b65cd20"}

Because of Davidson Homes I will spend Christmas 2018 sleeping on someone's floor instead of in the new home I contracted to have built. Why? Because the contractor blames the city of Madison instead of admitting they tried to take shortcuts.  My original completion date was suppose to be in October. Then a closing date was set for Nov 12. A few days before closing I received a call telling me the backyard failed engineering inspection due to flooding. This was an issue that I had asked about before I purchased the property and asked about during the building process after visiting the site when it rained. I was told it was \"OK\" Then the home would not pass inspection. Davidson let the property sit for over a month with no work being done. I was told they would put a retention wall in November by Jake Blagburn.  After extending my monthly lease on my apartment 3 times I was forced to move out or pay more than double rent because I was month to month. I contacted the Sales manager Lou Paratore at Davidson and asked to help put me up in lodging. He flat out said \"NO\" you have to pay to live somewhere. Which is true. Yet Davidson Homes cannot give me a date as to when the home I gave them a down payment would be ready.!He then explains that work would began maybe the week before Christmas and maybe the home would be done sometime in January. I am offered no compensation only apologies. Yet for Christmas and New years I am sleeping on the floor on a air mattress while paying for storage.

I went to Badger Properties because I read good reviews on Google and had heard generally good things from people. I went to the office in person and told Chris \"the badger\" my situation. I was just getting out of a 12 month rehab program, and had been working for a Christian Ministry and looking for an apartment in Auburn since I was a student at Auburn University at the time. I was very up front about my bad credit but was working 7 days a week and had many references etc to back up that I was honest and good for the rent every month. After seeing me alone in his office after hours, and asking me to come along (still alone) with him to see one of the properties (still after hours) I agreed because I was desperately in need of an apartment. He took me to an apartment to collect rent from a girl around my age, then he took me to another apartment where he basically showed me a place and then just sort of \"visited\" with some tenants. Every one seemed to like him, the apartments were pretty nice for how old they are, regardless, I was impressed at the time. We then went back to his office (once again, all happening after business hours) and he gave me an application, but before he did that he sat me down in the seating area of his office. We were completely alone and it was very dimly lit, and the front door was locked. He asked me extremely probing and personal questions about my past drug use. Mind you, I was sober for over a year at this point, active in church (still am) and admittedly hadn't even smoked a cigarette in over a year. He asked me questions like, \"So what led you to do drugs?\" \"what kind of drugs have you tried?\" \"how did you do your drugs? did you shoot up? snort them?\" He just kept asking SO many invasive and frankly, inappropriate questions; it was almost sadistic. I answered them as honestly as possible without divulging too much, because I really needed an apartment, I was impressed by the ones he had shown me and I thought that being as honest as I could would show him that I was a good tenant despite my bad credit, etc. After filling out an application and getting my credit checked through the program he said he uses to run credit (which gave a very vague summary of ones credit) I went back to his office once I had submitted my credit report and application. He said he didn't think he could rent to me because my credit report showed that I was $25k in debt; I explained that those were my student loans and that the program he uses wasn't showing exactly WHAT the debt was, just the amount. He said he couldn't rent to someone who was that far in debt. I explained that I am a student and that those are my student loans. I said, I would get a more in depth credit report and bring it to him. He gave me back my money order with the application fee on it and said to come back with a new credit report. My aunt is a real estate agent and she ran my credit for me, this time I had a complete credit report with every single student loan showing in detail, but because I had now ran my credit twice in one week, my already poor credit score was even lower. Despite that I went back to \"the badger\" and told him that the large amount of \"debt\" he saw was indeed my student loans, which were not even in collection because I was still attending Auburn at the time. He said then said he couldn't rent to someone with a credit score as low as mine and with a history like mine (due to my past drug use I had a criminal record. I have not had a single run in with the law in almost 4 years). So all in all, after wasting time, money, energy and being thoroughly humiliated, I would say that Badger Properties only serves those they deem worthy, and they don't believe in giving people second chances, only sadistically probing and dissecting the past of people who have made mistakes despite turning their lives around. A huge waste of time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459895750596, "text": "After 15 years of running Badger Homes and Badger Properties, I stand by my record of treating all applicants fairly in terms of their qualifications for an apartment.  They area 1) Credit score, from a tenant or direct relative, 2) Academic progress, and 3) good references from their previous landlord.  As stated above, our screening reports DO only show a credit score, they do not show a full report - meaning, we don't know the type of debt.  Our screening criteria is designed to approve or deny based on the SCORE, regardless of the type of debt.\n\nIf this dispute ever got serious, *I could produce a chain of emails which would explain and clearly show the reason for Denial*.  There was never any \"trade\" or \"back door\" approval process offered, and their never has been since I started the business.  We document every case of approval or denial, so we are ready to defend against accusations such as these.  That is not how we operate.  To have one negative review in 15 years should be evidence of how we do things.  Are we perfect?  No.  But we don't run the kind of business we are being accused of in the allegations above.\n\nOn the rehab comment: I can confidently say that we have rented to people coming from / still in rehab programs.  We have also rented to gay, straight, and many different religions and ethnic backgrounds, as well as singles, married couples, singles with kids, and families.  We have rented to people with low credit scores, also, but they must have a direct relative with a qualifying score be screened and sign as a Guarantor for their lease.  Our records are clear on that as well.  The \"second score\" that was brought to me to qualify was well below our minimum qualification.  We require a 650, the score presented was well below 600.\n\nAs stated above, there was not a qualifying score, and possibly not the required academic progress - but maybe\nshe met that qualification, I honestly do not recall.  We do not search any Applicant's criminal record, only our employees.\n\nAs stated above, I DID refund the Application Fee, and provide a true explanation of the reason for denial.  I do not remember asking questions about shooting or snorting drugs - I don't even know enough about drugs to know what that would mean anyway.  I have never even had a beer in my life, which everyone I've known for 41 years can verify.\n\nAfter hours, most (not all) of the lights are off in our storefront office, and the door is usually locked, but it is a full glass storefront on a busy street full of shoppers - so hardly a threatening or scary place.  I admit I probably asked questions that I didn't officially need to ask, true.  I am sorry if doing so had a worse impact than I expected.\n\nI do remember that the reviewer above and I did go to see an apartment and collect rent from a neighbor, but in most cases our rent is paid online, and has been for years.  I always thought that giving tours after hours and visiting with tenants after hours was a sign of good customer service, not something I would have to defend later.\n\nIf an independent auditor surveyed all of our current and previous tenants - male and female - over the last 15 years, they would come up with a conclusion that we are a little slow on maintenance, tough on noise, but that's about it.  If they surveyed everyone that has applied and that we have turned down over the last 15 years, they would find that there was a clear reason for each denial, and it was based on our written requirements of Credit Score, Academic Progress, and References.  That's it.  There is no evil, juicy story to report.\n\nAshley applied to rent from Badger in Sept 2014 for a Dec 14 opening..  I admit, I could have done better with the questions or the office lighting(?), but I have made no further attempt to contact her or to be in her life in any way beyond the Application period.  I am not sure why in April of 2016 she has decided to bring these accusations/allegations."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf31c31a91691:0x5164e38502b4d2b0"}

Regrettably, the shower drain requires a special tool to repair and the contractor did not have such tool available at the time they were on the property on May 27 (the same day you reported the leak). Based on the documented emails and telephone calls between you, your husband (Mr. Forbes) and our office, we attempted to reschedule the shower leak repair multiple times during a time when you or your husband would be present. Unfortunately, due to several miscommunications by the parties involved, this leak was elevated to an emergency status that would allow access to be granted without your presence and/or permission as per the terms of your lease. We entered your premises on June 8, less than two weeks after you reported the leak, to complete the repair by the contractor while being supervised by one of our employees. After we entered your premises, several lease violations were then noted - including the presence of multiple breeds of pets that previously were not disclosed by you or your husband.  We understand your concern about our respect for our residents and their rights; however, the owners of the property also have a responsibility and rights to protect their property (and your home). After an extended period of time not being able to schedule a time when all parties could be present, the owner\u2019s rights to protect the property from continued damage from the leak were enforced - which triggered other property rights issues that we are attempting to work with you for you to bring into compliance with the terms of our lease. We do appreciate your tenancy since mid-May 2018 and apologize that our relationship has degraded in the short time you have been a resident in Alabama. Hopefully, we may be able to better serve you in the future and avoid any further miscommunications or lease violations."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bec3e7601ab:0xeb291356c63d2968"}

From the first interaction we had until the most recent as of yesterday, the employees at Brock Point have been dishonest with us. Once they lock you in through their deceitful sales tactics you are along for a horrible ride.\n\nWe were told 7-8 months from Contract to Close (possibly 6). After revised dates after revised dates it now stands at 11 1/2 months to Close. All we keeping getting from Signature Homes is they are behind schedule with no recovery plan or attempt to make up any time. They continue to work on spec homes while people who have Contracts wait. This occurred with many people in Brock Point and continues.\n\nThe amount of quality issues has been enormous. From plumbing being placed in the wrong location in the slab (required jacking up the floor) to retaining walls being poured too high to the house being painted the wrong color, it has been a comedy of errors. The framing was a complete QC nightmare with more issues than I can type. We can only imagine what\u2019s left to come.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many choices in the Hoover School District to build a new home. However, we suggest looking long and hard at other subdivisions. It is possible other Signature Homes subdivisions aren\u2019t this bad, but is unlikely given the people we have spoken to and conducted meetings with control the overall company. Good luck to all those that still have homes to build with Brock Point!\n\nEDIT: We officially moved in 2 weeks ago after 11 1/2 months from Contract. There is a already a leak above our Master Bedroom and our ceiling is ruined. I can't wait to see how the repair goes.

I was initially supposed to have my pre-construction meeting in January. Unfortunately, my family had an unexpected death the same week and had to reschedule. The next available appointment wasn\u2019t until February. After I had the pre-construction meeting with the construction manager, I received and signed the meeting notes that had the \u201cpricing\u201d based on the selections made. I received an email over a week later notifying me that because I had to reschedule the pre-construction meeting my construction date had to be pushed out and the price of the house increased by over $30,000! So now I am back at square one looking for my next home.  This just may be my blessing in disguise. If a company doesn\u2019t see you for more than a dollar, then maybe they don\u2019t deserve my money.  I\u2019m truly shocked and disappointed by the lack of empathy shown given the situation. I\u2019ll never recommend anyone to this builder just based on this experience alone. I\u2019ve heard of nightmare stories, but I never imagined this would really happen. I get that companies are in the business to make a profit, but I do not believe that in less than a month the price we agreed to per our signed contract should have increased by over $30,000. I understand that there is an influx in this market however you don\u2019t tell me a week after sending me documents to sign (which I did) that my contract is null and void due to market demands. It\u2019s really devastating that a company that has built its reputation on people and prides itself on the best interest of the customer would do just the opposite.

It was nice having a decent number of choices and Charlie/Cindy helped a bunch answering questions and suggestions.\n\nAs a whole, we still love our house and the neighborhood. It's a great location, nice neighbors, quiet, and will be a great place to raise our family.\n\nOn the house itself, during and after build, quite a bit of poor quality work kept being attempted to be passed off as normal.\n\nLimited quality control appeared to be performed. There were obvious issues that they just ignored; mostly cosmetic but some big ones too with outlets (see below).\n\nIt was known this was our first home purchase and I really feel they tried to take advantage of that. Instead of doing things right, they appeared to cut some corners and I guess hope we wouldn't notice or know any better.\n\nIt is disappointing when, based on reviews, it seemed like it'd be a stress free and streamlined process from a local company.\n\nSome of the good stuff:\n- Working with Cindy on selections was great. She really helped get things in order. Same with the Richards lighting folks who were great as well.\n\n- We really like the flooring (Cindy really helped out with us picking them!). Wolde did a good job making it look good.\n\n- Overall we love the kitchen. They did an extended counter/cabinets and moved pantry shelves to the large side closet instead. Got plenty of counter space with lots of storage - exactly what we wanted.\n\nExample of issues:\n\n- Improper outlet installations. Backstab connections on most, box recessed too far and mounted incorrectly (exposed drywall screws through box into stud), and drywall screws to attach outlet to boxes.\n\n- Bad outlet cutouts. Large chunks of drywall missing and tried to hide it with plate covers. Some of the holes were even outside the plates.\n\n- Ceiling drywall seams are very noticeable with bumps, tape edge, etc visible. For open plan and this lighting, a higher level drywall finish was needed.\n\n- Venthood was originally installed with no seal to the attic, just left open. They did come and spray foam up in it to seal it but should have been addressed by MH checks.\n\n- Stove is different model than what we ordered. Nobody called to let us know original not available anymore - it was a slide in, this one is free standing. Had I known I would have changed to a cooktop (prefer stoves with overhanging tops which this one is not).\n\nEdit:\nDropping to 1 star due to behavior of sub-contractors. Electrician walked in arguing, wouldn't listen to any concerns, everything was fine even if another electrician said it wasn't - and I have their report.\n\nIf you feel someone is wrong, discuss it and show why.

I will say that I've called within those hours and had to leave a message before but they've always called me back.  They have an email address for emergency maintenance which they've always been responsive to as far as I am concerned at least.  The people who work there are always polite and helpful.  I've had issues with bugs in the past as well but they sent an exterminator over for an extra spray a couple of times between the regular monthly spray and the issue was taken care of.  The guys who do their maintenance seem very nice.  They've surely never been rude or disrespectful.  I've had a couple of situations where they came to fix something and didn't have all of the parts the needed, so they had to leave and come back- once even hey had to order a part and it didn't come until the next day, but they seem to be qualified and have always made repairs that meet my standards.   I've surely never been made to feel as if they don't care about me or my issues.  I see them at least once per month to pay rents. I always have a delightful conversation with Jenny who works the front desk.  She is always kind to ask about my family and my life.  This business is very community oriented and involved in most every event that goes on in Montevallo.  I always see that they've sponsored little league and parades and festival and food drives.

I don't live in Montevallo and the property I was renting was in Alabaster. So since you can't pay rent online, I gave the post dated check so that I wouldn't have to drive back to Montevallo. I was assured TWICE by the clerk that this was okay. Fast forward after I paid my initial deposit as well as first month's rent.

HE took no ownership, did not apologize, complained about a $50 fee he would have to pay b/c of my returned check and then hung up in my face.

I've have tried calling their sales office, I was told to call corporate, I called corporate and got voicemail.\n\nMy house is about 4 years old.  Well out of warranty.  But, most of the poor workmanship appears after the warranty period has ended.  My master bath and entrance to our master bedroom has severe structural problems.  The cracks you see have been re-plastered and painted more than once.  Forget about doors closing properly.  The doors have been trimmed to such an extent that a new door will be required for the bedroom.  The framing issues you may have will not be covered by your warranty and will not appear until a few years after you own your home.  Once they do, you will find yourself spending a lot of money to repair.\n\nIf framing were the only issue, I probably would not write the review.  I never do this kind of thing.  But the electrical was done so poorly that it nearly burned the house down.  The left exposes copper to aluminum high voltage line exposed in a junction box.  The result was blowing out the double oven's control panel.  This resulted in an expensive repair to the ovens, but could have easily resulted in a fire.   Again-- the kind of thing that happens well after your warranty period has expired.\n\nThe problem I have with Woodland, is that their \"quality\" is only skin deep.  They have a great marketing staff, but once your in your house and a year has passed you are on your own to deal with the poor workmanship that lies just below the surface.  No builder is perfect.

The sub-contractors don\u2019t keep up with their warranty repairs and Woodland doesn\u2019t follow-up with you after closing unless you are constantly in contact with them. Check my review of Custom Interior Trim to see just how their subs act and treat customers.\n\nTheir warranty team is an absolute joke. They don\u2019t follow-up, they don\u2019t coordinate, and if you aren\u2019t keeping them in line, they just let your items slide off the radar.\n\nThey have shown a complete lack of professionalism ever since we closed. I will admit, we love the house itself. It\u2019s good quality, the design process was fun, and we felt like the options they had to choose from were exactly in line with what we wanted, but the worst mistake I ever made was trusting that they would continue their great service after having closed on the house. If you don\u2019t listen to anything else, just hear me when I say do NOT let them close on your house until they finish everything. It has truly been bad enough that I regret ever choosing them as a builder, no matter how much we do like the house itself.\n\nAnd again, if I\u2019m being completely honest, the staff that they have are nice people. I mean I have legitimately enjoyed dealing with most of their staff, but I\u2019ve also had to do their job for them. I have to do all of the follow-up to make sure people are showing up to do their warranty repairs. I\u2019ve had to coordinate with the warranty department and the subs to make sure they had all of the correction items listed.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting dealing with Woodland and their lack of support for Warranty customers. I\u2019ve told them this multiple times, but if they would put just as much care into how they treat and deal with Warranty customers as they do with new customers still in the building process, they would be a nearly flawless business.

We are happy to hear that you had a fun experience and enjoyed our process of building. Next, we would like to say that we understand your frustrations with warranty. We are in fact struggling with time lines and subcontractors. At this time North Alabama and surrounding areas are experiencing a housing boom. This combined with the struggles of building a product in the midst\u2019s of a global pandemic have made it difficult to obtain products for some of our customers warranty requests.\n\nIt is also difficult to keep subs motivated when they have so much work to choose from in front of them. This is just the honest truth, and the reality of the world we are living in.  That said we understand it is frustrating to wait on your items to be completed. While it may take us a little longer to complete a warranty item we are getting to all of our customers and completing their warranty requests. In fact, we have even extended specific warrantable items past the agreed upon 1 year term in order to ensure our customers are happy, and have their items completed .\n\nSince we don\u2019t know your full name there is no way to reach out directly. We would encourage you to call your onsite sales person and get them involved to assist you, or even call our corporate office and ask for the president of the company. He will be happy to work directly with you."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626897a1fd8d25:0x85114f992ebfd966"}

The personnel in the home office were welcoming and professional. During the build I hired a home inspector who found major errors with the home.

Upon walking through my home I found basic issues with the craftsmanship that should\u2019ve been addressed by the site manager, if he had completed a walk thru of the home. Once the home was complete a final walk thru was scheduled. I found the same issues as the last walk thru. At this point, if you don\u2019t address the problem it\u2019s often overlooked. I refused to sign for the keys. As a buyer I felt rushed to sign for the keys to the home, that wasn\u2019t ready. I was promised the issues would be addressed in a timely manner, \u201cI\u2019M STILL WAITING\u201d. I still have a page of outstanding issues with my home. As a premier builder I expected more. The subcontractors provided poor quality of work. No disrespect, but the attention to detail lacked, for my home. I hope no one has to go through what I did. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s due to the number of homes Woodland is trying to build or is this the standard issue with Woodland across the board. I didn\u2019t want to come off as a complainer, so I asked around my neighborhood and many of us shared the same problems. This is not to bash Woodland. The homes, cosmetically looks great, I think more effort needs to be made to build a better quality home for the price and oversight of the subcontractors is a must. If this doesn\u2019t happen hold the site manager accountable. The warranty department shouldn\u2019t make people feel like they are the problem. The subcontractors need to do their job and provide a quality product.

It actually defies logic that I could desire so much to live there, be impressed with what I saw, and have the experiences I have had. Maybe it is coincidence but I don\u2019t think so. I will simply state what happened and let the reader decide. I have seriously looked at Woodland homes 4 times. The first experience was positive but I was afraid of the road in and out of the area so I decided not to buy. The last 3 times I had resolved that fear and wanted to purchase a house from Woodland homes. The first of these three, I spoke with an associate. He showed me a lot and gave me a price for a home on the lot. He said we had to see his boss. I did so and she literally panicked. She said he gave me the wrong price. I said ok and left. The second of these 3 times, Woodland homes sent me an email with an advertisement for a house already built. It was priced in the range we were looking for. We made an appointment with the aforementioned realtor and spent 30 minutes looking at the home. It had one feature we did not like but we were about to make an offer when she said oh no, this house has been sold. She added, but we can build you one like it on another lot. We spent a couple of hours looking at lots and found 3 we liked. She said she would send us the prices on all three. The result was that the lot we wanted was not available for the house we wanted to build on it and the other two had prices that were 40 to 50 thousand dollars more than the one we looked at. Not exactly the same price...The last time my wife met with a different realtor and got prices for several models one of which was built and the other almost completed. You have probably guessed what happened. I showed up with the checkbook only to find that all of the homes with quoted prices were much higher than documented on the plans provided to my wife. The one we really wanted was about $70,000 more. The other home already built was about 40,000 dollars more than documented on the plans.We left and will not return. The neighborhood looks great and maybe our experience is some kind of odd anomaly. Just wanted to share it.

However, if you are looking for top quality and attention to detail, you would be better off with another builder. They build homes quickly - maybe too quickly as evidenced by some of the problems we have experienced.  After living in our home for two years, a light switch in our dining room which was not in use at the time suddenly sparked and popped and caused a breaker to blow.  I called an electrician who discovered that the wiring was barely connected which caused arcing and sparking.  He then checked a few more light switches and outlets to find that about half of them were loose and sloppily constructed.  I ended up paying for the electrician to inspect every light switch and electrical plug in my home. I have also had to replace wiring in the electrical box because of a humming noise.\nWhen you build a home with Woodland, they schedule you for a one day marathon of dealing with the contract staff and their design team.  You must be prepared to make ALL decisions in one day.  Their design center has a limited number of choices and you have no time to research products. Don't assume that they offer quality products, either.  Price Pfister products were their plumbing choice at the time I built my home. Huge mistake.  If I had known how crappy this brand was, I would have insisted on Delta products. That goes for wood floors also.  I chose a \"premium\" product for an additional cost only to find after it started denting and scratching immediately that it was made out of a soft eucalyptus based engineered wood.  I have already replaced half of it with a nice Hickory engineered wood that has held up beautifully- even in high traffic.\nI was not happy with either their ceramic tile selection or carpet choices but had no option other than to pick what I disliked the least.  Apparently, most of my neighbors did the same because we all have the same back splash.  I have already replaced carpeting in my bedroom because of poor wear.\nThis is not the first home that I have had built so it is not like I was expecting perfection.

I now have damage in one bedroom and all my insulation is wet.\n\nAs for the floors the only response I get is Wolde put those in and from Wolde I get Woodland rushes us to put them in before they can acclimate to the house. What a run around and hassle you do not want to deal with.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626897a1fd8d25:0x85114f992ebfd966"}

Loved the place but the lack of urgency when maintenance was needed was horrible. When I first moved in, they gave us the house completely disgusting and not cleaned... Even had vomit in the trash can. The worst part was a few months ago when waiting for my security deposit to come back to me they kept half of each of my roomates and my money and said that they needed to \u201cpatch the holes\u201d in our wall from where a tiny 32 inch TV was mounted when that costs no more than 10$. They also said that they needed to hire a cleaning service when my parents and I and my roomates spent 3 days making the place spotless. Bad management and I don\u2019t appreciate the scam just to keep my 300$ for no valid reason. Don\u2019t recommend", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602ece8cf19bd:0xb4cedb8583eff879"}

I was in walking distance to school, work, Monish Park, Bama Lanes, etc. I always paid my rent on time and never had any issues in the leasing office. I had to find a sublet because I'd moved to Washington, D.C. for my internship and the communication between myself and the leasing office was so open. I was about 13hrs away and Mr.David made me feel like I was sitting in his office speaking with him. To this day, I still miss my apartment!
