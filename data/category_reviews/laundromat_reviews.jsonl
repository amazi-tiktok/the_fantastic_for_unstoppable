You would've thought they would've taken all my other items and politely declined to clean the Gucci item but they declined all service. They sent me down the road to Sessions Cleaners who gladly took all of my items and promised a turn around by 3:30 the next day. Don't go to Fleming. Go to Sessions. They're much better people and aren't intimidated by expensive designer fashion items. Do the math, and it doesn't make sense. Suits range from 50 dollars to upwards of 5,000 dollars... Why can't you dry clean a 300 dollar headband? It shows your error margin and mistakes are high. Sessions. Not Fleming. Trust me.

There was a camper from Texas who was witness to the assault, and told the officer how the man verbally attacked me and threatened me.\nSo, as I predicted, the officer informed him of the laws, and on the advice of the officer, the owner left.

But to be honest, it\u2019s a low-level criminal racket. Maybe not criminal in the \u201cblantatly breaking the law\u201d sense. But criminal in the \u201cwe wish we were ballsy enough to steal money openly\u201d sense. The machines are extremely overpriced and operate with spotty reliability at best. I think the most frustrating thing about my last trip to this establishment (I\u2019ve been numerous times, but will not be returning) was that the manager was purposely unhelpful. Honestly, she came off as a third tier con-woman who couldn\u2019t commit to her grift. She was so petty that she tried to blame her dryer eating $4.00 in quarters on user error. So look, the machine was working just fine and one more button was pressed and it stops completely, cancelling out all of the money that was put in moments before. I\u2019ve played slot machines that are less rigged. She tried to argue that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the dryer to eat quarters without user error and she didn\u2019t offer any refund or alternative solution. But, if the Space Shuttle can crash, then it is absolutely possible for a 10 year old coin-operated dryer to malfunction. This woman was petty. I didn\u2019t want my money \u201cback\u201d per-se. I just wanted an alternative to giving the machine another $4.00. I say she was petty for two reasons: 1) she just looked petty 2) I witnessed her counting hundreds of dollars in quarters an hour before her mobster machines shook me down for sixteen quarters, so I know $4.00 wouldn\u2019t make or break her fine establishment. Additionally certain dryers will straight up TOAST your clothes. I\u2019m not saying get them really hot, but toast as in the avocado variety. Completely ruined a set of sheets. In the same day that the dryer that can do no wrong mugged me for the price of 3 tacos from Taco Bell. The bottom line is that there is only one helpful employee there, and he is genuinely helpful. However Cruella Petty McManager stops her employees from serving the customers fairly. This is not an honest business. The great irony in all of this is that this manager quite literally has the \u201cI Need to Speak to the Manager\u201d haircut.

The first issue was; I paid to wash and dry my own clothes and needed to run a errand. I asked the staff to fold my clothes and they said to pay when I picked them up. When I arrived to pick up my clothes only 6 items were folded and the other twenty were hung. The bill was $19 and change essentially to put my clothes on used hangers. When I questioned the service they stated, \"I just didn't feel right about folding those\". I payed for a service that I did not get. Two other times the machines took my money and I had to move machines and pay again. Tonight I brought my already laundered clothes to dry when I arrived 4 of the six working large dryers had clothes just sitting in them. I asked the manager if she would take them out so I could use them and she said, \"No, they are here somewhere.\" So I bent down and used the bottom dryer, even though it hurt to bend over with my injury. Sat in my car went in before my dryer finished got my clothes and the same dryers still had the same clothes. Poor customer service. After all that I had to walk through the plume of cigarette smoke from the manager sitting by the door as I left. I won't go back and highly discourage anyone from going there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a407ac7fe8573:0x1e723009a3d55daa"}
