Some friends and I went last weekend and found the key to our room in 15 minutes and were confused because we\u2019d barely opened any boxes. The guy working told us our room had been put back together wrong and items and clues were out of order and he didn\u2019t know why. He wasn\u2019t going to give us our money back or anything, we had to ask him if we could come back again the next week since it was a waste of time and money. He let us do that so that was the only good thing. We literally came back this weekend and our room was messed up AGAIN. We were missing clues and nothing made sense, we tried to call for clues/help multiple times and had to wait TWENTY minutes until after time ran out when the worker finally came back. So basically we spent 20 minutes looking for clues that werent there then we sat in our room for over 30 minutes just waiting on someone to come help us and let us out. It was absolutely ridiculous. We still never got our money back and we refused to come back again for another \u201ccorrect\u201d room. In addition to all of that, THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR ROOMS ON THE WEBSITE ARE NOT WHAT THE ROOM ARE ACTUALLY LIKE. we were disappointed because we chose both of our rooms based on the online description yet when we got in both rooms the storyline was COMPLETELY different. Super unprofessional, the workers hardly know the clues or how the rooms work themselves. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to anyone. One of my worst experiences and I will never go back.

Throughout the game, I noticed we actually had to open the escape room door to ask if anyone was there to help us\u2014we had multiple hints. Even received extra with beverage purchases... the hint providing service was slow. Secondly, before the game started we were informed that the room had a tough lock to open where every group struggled... understandable... we received the hint to open the tough lock but failed to open so we called for assistance. Hilariously enough, even the game master struggled to open the lock... this whole process of opening one, tough lock took approximately 15 minutes\u20141/4 of our game time. With the intention of completing destroying the lock and my foot on the wall, I had to pull that one lock off with all my force after the game master left. But the game master assured that the time would get frozen\u2014cool.\nThirdly, when time was up... the game master does not hesitate to end the entire game by punching in the last code spoiling everything. There was not a single thought in the game master\u2019s mind to ask us whether we desired just a bit more time to crack the room... Game master simply walked in, punched the code, and we all stood there awkwardly, confused, & disappointed.\nWe complained about the lock... their response was there was prior information given before the game\u2014true. We recommended them to please replace it immediately\nWe asked if there was anything that could be done to remedy our dissatisfaction with the room and the fact we paid $200 for one hour to elapse so unfortunately. They informed us that it was up to the owner to perform refunds, but the manager informed us with a possible discount sent through our email. It\u2019s been a week... nothing. Obviously, their customer service skills need to be reevaluated.\nWas a real tragic end to a group\u2019s Friday night honestly.

The party was scheduled 1:00-3:00. We showed up around 12:50 assuming it was going to take 10-15 minutes to get all 6 kids setup and ready to play. Unfortunately that wasn\u2019t the case. The kids didn\u2019t get setup and playing until around 1:40 (leaving only an hour to play).  At 2:40 the kids we sent into the party room to eat pizza and open presents.  At 2:50 the guy came in to inform us that we had to be out of there within 10 minutes.  Keep in mind that we paid for 2 hours of playing for the kids and it took 45+ minutes before they all could start playing. The guy that was working informed us that it normally isn\u2019t this troublesome and he wasn\u2019t sure what was wrong  ( we even had a PC crash in the middle of a game within 5 minutes after we finally got it up and running). I will say the only positive to the experience was how nice the staff was but for $275 I expected to at least get an hour and 40 minutes of playing time before eating and we only received maybe an hours worth.
