I would actually rate it lower but the fried chicken is good and that got them an extra star. 1st visit Ate lunch at Yard Birds Chicken Company. Today was the grand opening so I will forgive them for forgetting the jalape\u00f1o cornbread then giving me biscuits and having to ask for ranch multiple times. The chicken was excellent, They use a crumbly crust almost like you use on fried green tomatoes. And It almost seems like they smoke the chicken first then batter and fry. It was tasty and next time I will have to have the hot. Now for the bad the corn bread was cold, not just room temp but cold. If it was warm then man it would have been great. As a suggestion please please add a honey butter with the warm cornbread or biscuits and it would be perfection.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB67Ig2rIVCVwn-kXoCR-W6S4oGRSUsPHAD2w=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnwaoXPa_WaTinbaf9Iu6SlzDGRj58gMR2JKk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgLx6y3GWSljM9S2fLaVicRkHvdX6s5JparYg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3jxyT29QGAyGNQZhsfe1InLAXtjsZtKV5yTI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWUxct2iDRAYQV3HAR4zzq74gi_5mt24x62As=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5KOcA99jJum3jSKKjhtk4WOIAHxsNE24r2D4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5lyoQ98LZMGXQyogs9O8Adjw92YzGTWc7BsM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMh0St-1-wiRxQUVS14Cg7DaKdJ5xoy6rTX5c=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc1bc4cb6cd:0xf143b2afe703a64e"}
