I called the store this time and they wanted me to uninstall everything and just give me a whole new one which i stated that I couldn't do that because i paid someone to connect everything which would mean that i would have to pay them again. She stated that they couldn't help me with that. I finally convinced them to just order the storage shelve that was dented and it would maybe take 2 months. At this point Im like whatever. They get me to Chris the appliance guy and he states that they have a whole unit in stock and they would deliver that shelve to me the next day. I was happy and ready to put this behind me. If only it was that easy. Chris stated that someone would call me the next morning to inform me of the time frame that day for delivery. They never called or showed up. That was Monday.

Over the past several years, my husband and I have purchased several large appliances. All of which were a nightmare of an experience.  No communication about delivery and expectations once your item is paid for. No delivery confirmations/calls from the \"warehouse\". The first items were a washer and dryer and fridge - they showed up 2 days late. Frustrating considering we needed the items urgently AND we took time off to be there at delivery time. Most recent was a dishwasher. The man in the back who sold us the dishwasher seemed like he would rather be anywhere BUT work. Honestly, we would have walked right out if it wasn't for the fact that I had some rewards to use at Lowes. He gave no information and in fact, told me I should \"search online and compare dishwashers\" because he wasn't an expert and didn't have a say on any of them. Then we asked about delivery. He had no info - not even on the process and we explained we had a bad experience before. Instead of sticking up for or explaining to us that maybe it was a fluke, he went on to talk about the \"warehouse\" and how many complaints they get on them. Not very reassuring. Our dishwasher didn't show up today so we will be canceling our order and we just opened a Home Depot account - so Lowes, you have lost a customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889048d83ba7ea7:0x35de940e38e1b1d2"}

We went in to return a work desk that he had purchased yesterday, only to come home and find out that pieces are broken and missing. When we arrived at the return desk we were greeted angrily by a lady named Shelia (her tag said CSA Front Desk). She was in the process of helping another gentleman with a wheelbarrow at the time we arrived so I shrugged her attitude off as frustration to begin with. By the time she got to us she took the receipt from my husband, asked angrily what was wrong to which he informed her that the desk portion (the main part of the item) was broken down the middle and pieces were missing. She rolled her eyes, mumbled a few things, then started to walk away and as she was walking into another room yelled back at us \"you know it's a clearance item right?!\"  She then came back out of that room, struggled to get the lid off the box and then continued to tell us in a displeasing tone that our kobalt work desk was on clearance. I then stated \"so does clearance mean that pieces are broken? If so, lowes should not be selling clearance items\". She then argued with me that clearance items are usually returns with missing pieces and I restated that the main portion of the item is completely broken in half. I don't care if it's clearance or not, it was not marked down nearly enough to compensate for a complete useless, damaged piece. She then slammed a refund receipt down and asked my husband to sign. She never asked if we wanted to swap it with a usable piece. She never asked anything, actually. During this entire transaction she was rude and everything anyone in customer service should not be. She was also complaining and cussing under her breath about no one answering the phone around there during our entire few minutes with her. When we were leaving there were 2 more men waiting patiently behind us and just staring in disbelief at what they witnessed and would unfortunately encounter. I told one man good luck as we walked off and he said it looked like he needed it. Needless to say, if lowes in fultondale is going to hire individuals of her caliber, we will not step foot back in that store and may in fact just take our business to Home Depot.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889048d83ba7ea7:0x35de940e38e1b1d2"}

Finally when we ordered the cabinets a few weeks later, we were told it would take 30 days to get them in and possibly a week extra to get them installed. Two days before we were supposed to get the cabinets in we received an email from the man we was working with stating that he was sorry, the order was incorrect and said he was leaving that he couldn't help us any longer. Well 3 cabinets were missing, and was measured incorrectly...... AGAIN. Don is the assistant manager over there and is terrible. We met with him and got another person to come measure... again and said we had to wait another 30days before it could be here and another 1-2weeks to install. Well the installer said when they got here he couldn't finish the trim because something was not finished. Don has told us from the start that we would sit down and discuss what needs to be done to make this right. I have called lowes 20 times and got Don at least 10 and said he would call me back. HE NEVER DOES. I have asked for the store manager Jeff left messages, still no answer. We have been dealing with this for 6 months and spent a lot of money for a normal person.
