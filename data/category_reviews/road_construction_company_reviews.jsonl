Cannot imagine what a terrible company the must be to ruin hundreds of people's cars due to their SLOPPY and unprofessional work and then deny all responsibilities for it. I had numerous friends also have their windshields damaged and claims denied be this company. So I am out $150 because huge business does not know how to do their job correctly or take responsibility for their actions like an adult.
