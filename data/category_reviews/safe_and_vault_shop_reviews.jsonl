(The other one is in Florence, and is owned by the same family.) Fort Knox safes are probably the beefiest and best-made safes the average consumer can buy.\n\nThis merchant works out of a structural steel building on the same property as their home, so if you drive up the driveway, turn left at the top and you'll see the building.\n\nThis is not a plush showroom; think of it more like a warehouse. It's not fancy, but the prices are reasonable, and the staff is very knowledgeable. They do sell other brands (including imports from China), but Fort Knox is their best brand; they even carry vault doors.\n\nThe purchase price does not include delivery, and delivering the safe into a building incurs a variable fee, depending on the difficulty of setting it in place. You can send a video of the path into the final position to the merchant, and they can decide what the fee will be.\n\nI enjoyed working with the sales staff (especially their rodent-control specialist, a 17-year-old brindled cat with a sweet personality), but unless you live nearby, I think I would recommend visiting their Florence location, as the trip from Huntsville took about two hours and ran through the Bankhead Forest.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8887e6910f01c3ad:0x7eaa2a6561ab97d9"}

I talked with Nancy. I was asked by my business partner to call and find out what options we had to get into a steel door with a keycode lock where the batteries had died. At some point the packet with the keys had been lost either during transit or by the end customer. When I told her that I was calling on behalf of my business partner, she immediately cut me off and told me \"I already told him once that he has to contact Browning because he has to replace that whooole lock system. They only have one set of keys per lock and their all different keys so he's going to have to replace that whole thing\". The delivery of this was with a very transactional tone so the customer service aspect was not great. One of the reasons that I was calling her was to verify what model of lock they actually sold our customer but after the initial interaction, I really didn't want to talk to her further so I called the next company in the chain of distribution. The problem with the lock system that was sold is that it is electronic and the batteries lock to the inside so there is no access once they die unless you have a key, and if there is no key, then you are looking at a major intervention. Again, I'm not blaming this company for the loss of the key, just a note about the transactional nature of the customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8887e6910f01c3ad:0x7eaa2a6561ab97d9"}
