He said he wasn't sure where he was but would take a message and have him contact me ASAP. I explained that I was calling based on the response I got off our review and he went to find Darrell for me. Darrell immediately apologized for everything and I told him we understand that things happen and that we have never ever had a bad experience with them except for that one time. I even told him that we had switched to them from Dixie Wings due to some bad experiences with them and couldn't have been happier. My husband gets there to pick up our replacement wings and just the look and smell of them was back to the quality of what we were used to. The taste of their wings makes you want to cry they are so good. I'm so happy we gave them a second chance and so happy that they are dedicated to make sure that their quality exceeds expectations. Thank you Jose, Darrell and the rest of the outfield staff.\n\nWe usually get wings from here at least once a week and have never had a problem with our wings. We got a 50 PC wing last night, mild and extra crispy. We live almost near big smoke diesel down hwy 80 so it's not a quick trip. My husband got home and when we went to eat some of our wings the first thing we noticed was there was hardly any sauce on them. Then there were only four flats and we were offered to pay an extra for only flats. That's not what we want....just half and half would be sufficient but 4 flats out of 50 wings is a bit ridiculous. But we were still going to eat them however as we were eating them they were extremely dry. We ate maybe 10 out of the 50 and when we called and spoke with Darrell we were assured that it would be made right. We ordered another 50, mild and extra crispy and took the other 40 from last night back to them. Brittany who works there said we've got you we will take care of it. Well when I get back from taking our daughter to the bathroom they wanted $28.50. So we said they could keep the ones we brought and the ones they just made for us. We aren't going to essentially pay twice for wings that should have been made correctly the first time. They've lost our business for good.
