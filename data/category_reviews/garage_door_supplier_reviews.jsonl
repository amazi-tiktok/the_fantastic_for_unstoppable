Further, he installed all my garage door openers, set all the remotes, and walked me through coding my keypad.\n\nPricing was quite fair - you certainly get what you pay for; it was well worth the cost of the installation, quality of materials, and amount of time it saved me from trying to install the openers myself.\n\nMorgan, my contact in the office, was excellent.

He was able to do this during heavy rain, an estate sale was occuring, so people were wandering around and getting in his way while he was working.  He was able to accomplish this without outwardly losing his temper or causing anyone to need to seek medical attention.\nI replaced this door about six years ago, when my mother backed from the garage without opening the door.  The company she used took nearly three weeks ordering the door, then installing it.   It was poorly done, with gaps on both sides of door. These allowed so much light in during the day, that lights were not needed during the day.  It was a solid door, no windows.  It also made so much noise, it would awaken me from sleep.  My bedroom is on the opposite end of the house. Jeff did such a great job installing this door!  It is the exact door that I destroyed.  Not only does not light come in when closed, but you wouldn't believe how quiet it was when it operates!  The other popped and creaked when opening and closing.  Jeff didn't have to replace the motor, just everything else.  I promise you, I thought the noise it makes now is negligible!\n\nMany thanks to Jeff,  and Sky Underwood. Skype took my original called, calmed me down, got me worked in the following morning, and everything he told to executed exactly as he said!  Which, in my experience,  is very rare.

To digress for a moment, I need to say that the motor and belt system previously installed by your company is really more quiet than the old chain system that the builder had installed.\nThanks for the help and great service people that you employ.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d6f7405f3cd:0xd40c32570338611c"}

The roll up door that was originally installed by another company in my garage/workshop failed.  I called Precision and they came out the same day.  Emanuel was very helpful and knowledgable.  He was patient with my many questions.  After some conversation, I decided to replace me roll up door rather than fix my existing door.\n\nThe door I needed was in stock so Emanuel came back the next day to install the door.  Even though it was the coldest and windiest day of the fall/winter season thus far, he worked efficiently and effectively.  He was most professional and his work was done in a masterfully craftsmanlike manner.\n\nBy doing a side by side comparison of the door that was originally installed to the door installed by Precision Garage Door - Mobile, it is obvious the door installed by Precision Garage Door is far superior.

Even though he didn't have a door switch since he had just sold his last one, and that was the only thing wrong with mine, he he did what he could to help and teach me on how to fix it myself once I got the part. He helped me fix my remote openers for my car by setting them up, helped me run a wire so I could wire in the switch once it arrives (my old switch was the battery powered one that was known to break when you tried to replace the batteries), told me to take my LED light bulb out because it would ruin my motor eventually, informed me to avoid using LED lights outside my house due them somehow interfere with the remote signals, showed me how to properly oil my door and how frequently it should be done, oiled my door, and told me everything that could potentially go wrong with the door or system and what I should do with each scenario and how to fix it.

After getting a quote to replace my back door, it took almost 6 weeks before they could come out to do the work. Then when i left for work, leaving my wife to be there while they finished and to pay them, they tried to double the price I was quoted. Luckily i was able to answer my phone when my wife called about it. After him trying argue about the price for 5 minutes nd him accusing me of trying to cheat him, we got it settled. When i got home the next morning and inspected the work, it was horrible, the outside was unfinished with bare presswood showing on bottom and a 2x4 showing and protruding from the top. The inside looked awful, they had re-used the old trim, after ripping chunks out of it, and cracking it in multiple places. Also the door was not squared up at all so the trim did not fit back together right. And finally left all their trash and old stuff they removed piled in my yard, along with a lot of new and old nails and screws scattered everywhere over my steps, patio, and in my yard. All in all a total rip off.  If you do decide to use these guys, make sure you get everything in writing up front, the quote, exactly what they agree to do, and perform a thorough inspection before paying.\n\nIn the pictures below you can see what condition they left everything in.

She took my email, sent my appointment information to me promptly.  An hour later I received a call from Jeremy telling me he was only 15 minutes away and he asked if it would be a bother to come early. I said absolutely, please by all means come over.\nHe arrived, came inside, acknowledged my two pups then went out to the garage to diagnose the issue. It was the sprocket in the top of the opener itself. And we didn\u2019t know it but the spring that was installed, was replaced twice by another company within the last five years because it was the incorrect spring that they had replaced it with. It wasn\u2019t near strong enough to support the garage door.  That was the first company that that I had called today to check if they could come today.\nHe quickly gave me an estimate and had the parts in his truck to fix it and I gave him the ok to repair.  To my astonishment, he was done in about an hour AND my garage door has never been this quiet.  Jeremy was very pleasant and accommodating. I give five stars to this company and they have gained a new lifetime customer. Don\u2019t even think of calling another company if you need overhead door replacement!

It means so much when our customers share their experiences.\n\nYour story is one rarely told in our review section; thank you for sharing that with us and others here on Google! It's wonderful that your garage door spring repair experience has made such a difference for you. Broken springs can be very dangerous.\n\nResearch by the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System shows that an average of more than 10,500 people suffers from injuries by their garage doors per year. The sizeable amount means that people should avoid opting for certain garage door DIY repairs. Spring systems exert extreme tension, which many people may have trouble understanding. For this reason, it\u2019s best to put the task of repairing and installing garage door springs in the hands of a garage door professional. We aren't saying it can't  be done by the consumer, but we do our best to educate accidents like head injuries, lacerations,  and broken wrists and fingers occur due to a lack of proper training and the use of incorrect tools. Sadly, in some cases even death.\n\nWe are sure Scotty enjoyed every moment of your garage door spring repair.\n\nThank you again for your review and your business.

I was worried it would take a long time, but I called in the late afternoon, and they apologized they couldn't get here until the next morning. Scotty had all of the tools and materials needed, and knocked out the spring replacement in no time. He mentioned the opener itself was likely going out. He guessed it's approximate age correctly and said it likely contributed to the spring going out (when I tried to tighter the chain). He later showed me where the sprocket was coming apart. Point is he asked if I'd like a new unit and gave me a deal and said he could knock it out in just a bit more time. Threw in a keypad as well. It fixed some other issues we were just living with (e.g., non-functional light), and the whole thing now is sooooo much quieter and nicer. This is one of the top companies we've ever dealt with.

We do appreciate his mention in your comment and Google 5-Star Review. You are so correct .... \"one slip and those powerful springs could change everything.\" A garage door torsion spring uses basics physics to function and operate.  Mechanical energy is stored as the springs are tightened and twisted.  They are mounted above the opening of your garage door so as the garage door goes down, the cables will make the spring wind up to move the garage door system. The same sort of action occurs when you open your garage door \u2013 the springs will unwind to allow the cables to lift the heavy door open. This winding and unwinding causes the springs to weaken over time. People will either see signs of wear on their springs and try to perform a replacement themselves, or the spring will snap while in use, causing tremendous damage. Garage door springs can last anywhere between five to seven years with average garage door use, so they do not need to be replaced often. But when it is time to replace springs, it is important to call a professional technician who has the tools and the skills to accomplish the task without causing damage to property or people.

Kenny and Mitchell were helpful in their capacities as well.\nBut I must say Dakota and Shawn impressed me more than any two young workers have in a long time if not ever!  Those two should be filmed for a virtual reality learning tool used by Overhead Door! Perfect!\nSincerely,   Liza Ault Burns\nOctober 10, 2019", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571775495603, "text": "Hello Liza  - Thank you so much for this great Google 5-Star Review.

I would not recommend.\n\nWasted 4 hours of my day and ended up with the my original broken garage door back on.\n\nVery dissatisfied. I Really suggest folks review the \u201clowest\u201d rating reviews on here...\n\nResponse to owners response below:\n\nYou are still missing it, the customer service (the owner) response to errors/mistakes made was the issue. To be clear, the workers were great and did excellent work.\n\nThe issue is, they made a mistake thinking they could use a standard garage door. I\u2019m not the expert, that\u2019s why I hired your company. Unfortunately, the standard door, left a 2 in gap at the bottom (fully across the bottom), not fully closing.\n\nThe response should have been, we will make this right for you, however that was far from the response I received. In fact I was pretty much blamed at the issue being my fault, somewhat comical.\n\nThe response I received was, pay for the door in full ($775) with the 2in gap at the bottom and overhead door will order a custom door and I\u2019ll (the customer) pay the additional fee after installation OR we will remove the newly installed door and put back the old broken door...sort an ultimatum- seriously.\n\nI was willing to pay 50% ($387.50) to leave the standard garage door (with 2in gap at the bottom) to allow time for overhead door to order and install the custom door then fit the remaining bill once complete. This would have also provided my tenants with a working garage door. However I was told by overhead door that offer was unreasonable and I needed to pay in full or they will take down the entire door...oh and btw if after I paid for the incorrectly installed door, it somehow gets damaged while I\u2019m waiting on the custom door, I\u2019m fully liable. Real nice customer service policy.\n\nSo, in true customer service fashion, overhead door would rather leave you hanging with old broken garage door even if the mistake is on their end.\n\nAgain - it\u2019s my personal opinion and experience to not go with overhead door in Madison AL.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1557345838303, "text": "Mr. Simpson,\n\nWe would like to begin by apologizing for your inconvenience.\n\nThe concrete floor of the garage at your rental property is unlevel.

The tech (who was nice) fixed the spring and had to reprogram the motor. Once he left, I closed my garage door. Well as soon as the door closes, it immediately opens again. It won't stay closed and it NEVER did that until after they were at my house. I called the office to get them back out to fix it because it didn't do that before. The rude woman in the office (Kelsey I think) was absolutely no help. She said that it's possible that we'd have to pay another $85 service fee just for them coming to my house but couldn't tell me for sure without seeing what was wrong. Look, I completely understand that policy. However, the fact that my door was messing up right after the tech left should automatically mean that the service fee is waived. What it seems to me is that this company is dishonest and will milk you for every $85 they can. I would never recommend this company solely based on the lack of integrity and no desire to have a good reputation. I will definitely make sure I tell all of my family, friends, my whole neighborhood  (since I'm on the HOA board) and both of my children's school PTAs not to use this company. All because they are so greedy to get another $85. Very bad business. My next review is with the BBB.\n\nUPDATE:\nA few days ago, I received a call from Jerry (either the manager or owner). I didn't speak with him because I decided to have my husband handle all communication with the company after I spoke with the woman in the office who was intolerable. I told him to call the next day to speak with my husband. I believe he did call and we missed it. My husband planned on calling him back on his day off. I received a refund in the mail today for the full amount we paid. It was unexpected and very appreciated. Even though we have not spoken with Jerry yet, I find that to be an exceptional gesture. He clearly knows how to conduct good business and cares about the company's reputation. I hope his approach trickles down to Kelsey in the office. I also want to add that Claire, who was the first woman I spoke with to make my initial appointment, was incredibly nice and helpful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886265175b68f62d:0xe8520cb2bbabb1d5"}

And the other piece of very important evidence that was left out of this review is that Mr. Chestnut neglected to inform everyone that he went out and purchased his own belt and decided to install it on his own without our help after we had done the Spring that he had called us about which happened to be still working at the time of this review.Also with the false statement that was made by him that he contacted us the same day when caller I'd can prove otherwise and would be more than happy to post a picture of the document that proves that he has made a very \" unscrupulous\" claim against our company that almost cost my lead technition his job .So I'm only writing this reply because this type of \"SLANDER\"should not be taken lightly .And  In finishing I only want to add that we just wish that if there was some type of a misunderstanding or problem on his part that he would have taken it up with us and not tried to be unscrupulous about it Because I assure you as we would any customer we would have gladly made things easier for him and made sure his door was in working condition in the end"}, "gmap_id": "0x888e80feb444639f:0x8b17a3a229c1c9d9"}

The Garage door tech came and was very pleasant and helpful. I paid $95 for him to come and measure my garage door space. He then asked me to check a website and order doors. First the hand written webpage was difficult to find as it had an error when written out. Then when I went to the website all my choices were in black and white drawings. I had no idea how this was supposed to look on my house and called the main office. First I received a voicemail and left a message which was never returned, I called a second time basically pleading for help, the woman who called me back sounded aggravated I had interrupted her and had no desire in helping me. I told her that we are a small business as well and we would like to support another family run small business and I would like to pay her and support her company, yet she still did not change her demeanor. Needless to say they came out in November, no help has been provided to ensure we get the doors we want and here we are in January and we still have no doors and none are ordered, and so far all I paid for is someone to measure my doors, and frankly I could have done that for free. I gave them 4 stars though that isnt my honest rating as it is much less, only because I have no desire in hurting their business by a bad review. If you can order garage doors and know what you are getting from a black and white hand sketching then maybe your experience will be better than mine, however, you have to be fully responsible for knowing you are making the right order with little help from my experience. With so many garage door companies online, I could have done the equivalent,  ordered random doors online for a fraction of the cost myself without paying someone nearly $100 to measure my doors for me. I sure wish the office lady would have helped with the order, otherwise what did I hire them for? to measure my doors? really?????", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a418c4c6c45c7:0x85a8f18f65594d69"}

I was quoted $700 and was told I needed a new door by this company only to find out that there is NOTHING wrong with the door at all. It just needs to be serviced properly. They sent the same two men out to my house on two separate occasions to \"fix\" my garage door. The last time they \"fixed\" it, it just fell apart. So, I called the competition, and they were VERY knowledgeable and helpful....and are only charging me a $98 service call to fix my garage door instead of making me pay hundreds of dollars for a new door that I DON'T need. STAY AWAY from Precision Door!!!\nSINCE I last posted, the company has in fact done everything they said they would do. They called me personally to apologize for what had happened AND they refunded my money. SO, what I can positively say about Precision is that at least they do try and make it right the best they can. I am happy for the way they handled the problem I had with them, so a big thank you for that!

A couple days ago, my wife informed me that the center track had fallen, so I checked it out and when pieces didn't match up right decided to call a professional to take a look.\n\nEnter Carl.\n\nHe came out within an hour of me having called and had the track repaired in no time. He didn't just call it quits though, he was going to get the wires back up and out of the way first. That was when the old motor decided it was going to first try to drive the door into the ground and then die.\n\nThankfully, the door itself was unharmed but the motor was shot. Carl didn't try to oversell me on the garage door opener and talk me up to a higher price point. In fact, he laid out the options and made it clear that the least expensive option would work just fine.\n\nSince this went from a simple repair to a replacement and they needed room to work, I scheduled for him to come back the next day so I could clear space in my garage, which could at least now be opened manually in the meantime. Instead of coming at the scheduled time, he called me when he had a slot come open several hours earlier and asked if that would work since I'd told him I work from home.\n\nBy the time my actual appointment time today rolled around, Carl had already changed out the motors. He made sure that everything was working properly and went so far as to help me get the app working on my phone before leaving. He was friendly, professional, and well informed about the products themselves.\n\nI would recommend Precision Door Service of Huntsville without hesitation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626a2804436955:0x832c600f6a39b267"}
