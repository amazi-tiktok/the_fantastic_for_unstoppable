Finally, a supervisor called back told me they driver was AWOL, the guy John who I was dealing with was fired and now they have to find a new driver,  like that was my fault. Took them days to get back to me after I spoke to another supervisor who said she would call back and guess what\u2026 no call back. Finally, they said the had a new driver and it would cost $1400 with $150 already paid so I would have to pay the driver $1250. After my son already signed a contract for $850. When I asked for a discount for my trouble and extra cost to rent my rental car for another week they told me no. I do not know how this company has such a high rating with the BBB when they obviously extorted $400 dollars from me to get my car to Trenton TX and another $700 for the extra week of my car rental.
