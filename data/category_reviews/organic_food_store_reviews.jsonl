Each day, they make fantastic meals out of organic, really healthy local food. It's true that some of the entrees can be kind of small, but the staff is really familiar with their menu, and they're honest about which meals are filling and which are lighter. The best thing is to let the staff know what you're in the mood for and ask them about their favorites (it's how I was introduced to their tomato tart, which is really outstanding).\n\nThe Pantry also makes fresh juice, and it all tastes amazing. I haven't studied the long-term benefits of juicing, but I know the juices here are delicious and make me feel great, so that's good enough for me. You can buy juice made that day out of the cooler or order something specific made while you wait.\n\nThis place is all about special little touches. The restaurant itself is small and incredibly charming, and they'll do things like serve free goat cheese samplers sometimes or serve cucumber water to add something special to every visit.\n\nThe Pantry also has a big selection of jams, cheeses, wine, beer and specialty items that make great treats or gifts for foodies. I haven't tried The Pantry for their waffle bar yet, but it's on my list after reading the other reviews.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891a13dc5a74e3:0x4f3b41e89928b158"}
