Today was the grand opening so I will forgive them for forgetting the jalape\u00f1o cornbread then giving me biscuits and having to ask for ranch multiple times. The chicken was excellent, They use a crumbly crust almost like you use on fried green tomatoes. And It almost seems like they smoke the chicken first then batter and fry. It was tasty and next time I will have to have the hot. Now for the bad the corn bread was cold, not just room temp but cold. If it was warm then man it would have been great.

Socialized with friends for a while and saw two missed calls a few minutes later at 6:53. No voicemails but I figured it had to be Domino\u2019s so I called back. Waited for 10 minutes and no one picked up. App said pizza was being delivered. Called back at 7:26 to see where food was. Finally got someone on the phone. The gentleman said he tried calling twice to tell me there were no delivery drivers available. But he could\u2019ve left a voicemail for that! Why did I have to try and call him back for that information? At this point we\u2019re all hungry and now the guests are upset.\n\nSo a few things here:\n1. The app shouldn\u2019t show my food is being delivered when it hasn\u2019t even been made.\n2. I shouldn\u2019t have been able to order delivery if the location doesn\u2019t offer it.\n3. The employee should have left a voicemail with the information and not wasted my time trying to call back for it.\n\nSo be careful using this location. The communication is very poor. Call ahead of time to see if they can deliver. Don\u2019t use the app.\n\nEDIT: Bumping up a star since the manager called me to explain the situation and obviously wants to make things right. I may give this location another try since it seems I caught them in a perfect storm of \"things going wrong\", and being a former restaurant worker myself, I can sympathize.\n\nMy order was flagged for review since it was associated to an address that has been linked to multiple phone numbers. This is a national Domino's corporate policy to keep tabs on potential sketchy orders.\n\nDomino's corporate always expects their franchisees to have delivery drivers, and never anticipates a scenario where a given store has no delivery drivers show up for work. So don't expect the app design to improve, and I can't fault this location for that.\n\nDomino's typically doesn't leave voicemails as they prefer to talk about potential order problems in person, and in my case, try to present an offer for me to pick up the pizza myself. Even so, we'll agree to disagree as the voicemail could have said \"We have no delivery drivers for tonight. Please call us back by X time if you still want the order and can arrange to have it picked up.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1627330944209, "text": "Our team appreciates your review and feedback.

I called and left messages TWICE! I have never in all my life seen such unprofessional service.  Mugshots just informed me that they are no longer using Dapper Deliveries and I don't blame them!\n\nFor those of you who follow me you know I have NEVER posted a rant about anything on my page but I am so frustrated with #Dapperdeliveries here in Mobile I could scream!  Here's the backstory:\n\nTwo weeks ago this coming Friday I ordered food through Dapper Deliveries at 6:32pm.  I received a confirmation that I could expect to receive my food within an hour. Well, at 7:45 I hadn't even received an email telling me that the driver had arrived at the restaurant.  I called the restaurant and was told my order had been sitting there for 20 minutes and they couldn't even get the driver to answer the phone.  The employee said she would keep trying.  She offered to remake my meal.  I thanked her and hung up.\n\nAt this point I called Dapper Deliveries myself.  I couldn't believe it when I received a message stating the call couldn't be completed!  I must have called that number 8 times!  At 8:10 the restaurant calls me back to tell me the driver had finally showed up and wanted to argue with her like it was the restaurants' fault.  The stupid driver arrives at my house at nearly 8:30!!!  TWO HOURS after I placed my order.  You know I was livid when I answered the door.  The fool stands there trying to argue with me too! I snatched the bag and slammed the door.  Anybody how knows me well, knows that is so completely out of character for me.\n\nPart III\nI open the food boxes and of course the food is stone cold! By now I'm ready to just go berserk!  I call the restaurant back to ask why my food is cold if they remade it.  The manager tells me that they had a very large party and to remake my food would have taken another hour.  I told her that wasn't an acceptable answer.  She offered to make it right and said the next time I was in the area they would provide a complimentary meal. Done. Great customer service!  Well done Mugshots!\n\nPart 4\nI call Dapper Deliveries the next day and ask to speak with the manager. I explained what happened and he says, \"I heard and I've issued a credit for $10.\"  At first I was like, \"Huh?\" No! I want every dime of my money back including tax, tip and delivery fee.  He agreed to issue a credit.  I checked my bank account 4-5 days later and didn't see the credit so I call again.  This time I'm told they don't give you your money back per se. They give you a store credit.  At this point I asked to speak with the owner because this has just escalated to asinine!  The manager said he would ask the owner to call me.  That was last Wednesday or Thursday.  Guess what?  Nope. Still no call from the owner as of this writing and thus this post.  I tried my best not to call em out publicly but Dapper Deliveries, you brought this public shaming on yourself.  I will NEVER patronize your business again.\n\nSigned,\nOne unhappy ex-customer", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e0b198b8061:0x4a101476be3b6217"}

The delivery fee is very reasonable at $2.99 vs. waitr's $5.00. Another thing I really love is that they don't restrict you based on \"delivery area\" like the waitr app, this is a major PLUS!\n\nWith all of those great qualities, it saddens me to say that I've noticed a decline in service. I can order something not far from my house, and it'll take an hour to get here. A few times, my food came spilled all over the bag. Once I ordered from an non-franchised restaurant  (meaning there was only 1 of its kind) and the driver ended up a completely different place and didn't even know it until i called over an hour later... During that instance, the manager & owners were very courteous and understanding.\n\nIn addition, I also feel like there is room for improvement on their app. For example, I know at the office, they can see where the drivers are through gps, I think it would be great if the customer could too, like at some pizza places. Also I think a rating system would be great to give feedback on drivers. 8 out 10 drivers I've had, we're amazing, but those other 2...\n\nWill I use Dapper Deliveries again? Yes, in the future. It's a relatively new company so there's expected to be some growing pains. I will, however, be taking step back for awhile, and hopefully they will get it back to the well oiled machine I love.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e0b198b8061:0x4a101476be3b6217"}

Fresh vegetables and any type of infused olive oils you can imagine.  The cheese display is incredible, and the staff is more than happy to give you a sample of any you would like to try.  Let's not forget the meat!  You can see the dry aging of beef in process.  It takes about thirty days to age the beef.  I bought a ready to cook meal that includes chunks of prime beef, carrots, onions, celery, potatoes, a half bulb of garlic, tomato paste and a red wine jus.  Cooked it in my dutch oven, and it was perfect.  I didn't have to cut up the vegetables or meat, so it was a great time-saver.  Did I mention the filets?  Bought two dry-aged and they grill to fork tender.  The flavor is certainly better than regular filets from the grocery store.  All meat is butchered in-house, by well-trained chefs and the house-made sausage is unique, yes classic.  I also bought pork chops that must have been over an inch thick.\nI highly recommend you buy from this specialty food store!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517078292301, "text": "Lorraine, thank you SO MUCH for your incredibly kind words.

There will be no \"next time\" BOTTOM DOLLAR ON THAT. Horrible experiences at this locations but tonight's interaction burns bridges. Granted, there was inclement weather tonight so some delay and difficulties were expected. However, from what I experienced tonight, Domino's Pizza off of Mobile Hwy would have been better closed. No matter, I ordered from the app and request delivery. I finalized the order on the app but I later received a call from the store, saying they didn't have delivery drivers (again, expected difficulties) and I need to pick up my food. What they didn't tell me is that they voided my app order, placing a hold on my debit card (upcoming 'last straw'), and I would need to bring my debit card to re-order. So, when I arrived at the store, lo and behold. They told me that I needed my card. Thus, I had to drive back through Tropical Storm Sally in a partially wrecked car, just to get my debit card. (Now, given my past dealings with this store, I should have know better but I am a naive person person at times.) I get back to the store, just to find out that because of the order I made on the app, Domino's Pizza tried to charge me twice for the same order. One for delivery and the other for carryout. I snapped. So what? I need to have at least 40 dollars in my bank account to order pizza. I am sorry; your tax dollars don't pay teachers enough for that. I find it really funny that Domino's Pizza can jump into your bank account so fast when you order but, refunding and correcting orders, they feint as bumbling idiots. I do not just hold the store at fault but the entire corporation. They have no regard for customer service; Domino's Pizza only cares about profits and their shareholders. I wouldn't drop or invest a dime into Domino's Pizza, with all the dried and burnt pizzas I have ordered over the years. Hell, Pizza Hut has a hotline for situations like this, but you invest your time in 'Pizza Insurance' and 'HotSpots'. How about fairly selling pizza when trying to double dip into people's bank accounts? How about optimizing your systems so errors like this can fixed quicker? Just go under, already.

Although the pizza tracker showed it at quality check phase (the last phase before delivery), I get a dead air call no one said anything. So I called back and get an answer from a rude Adrian screaming and cutting me off because I questioned him about waiting 30minutes to call me to tell me they don't deliver in my area after dark. In which I just received a delivery from them about a week or 2 at this hour ago so I guess it's a new policy, So why was I able to place an order and why was I charged and again 30MINUTES before you call knowing you have an online tracker indicating the steps of my delivery??????? Don't waste your time dealing with these people. It's a hit or miss on the quality of your service or if you'll get your food at all.
