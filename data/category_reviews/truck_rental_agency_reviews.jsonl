I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.

The first time when I moved to this area I dropped off my UHaul equipment here and a middle aged Army Veteran greeted me and helped with the process of the return. He also helped me to figure out the area and gave me some local information which was very helpful. Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge. His kindness, professionalism, and overall customer care is the entire reason UHaul still has my business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626d1442a93003:0x7d8a498adb157034"}

I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...   Finally, at the end of the transaction I thanked him and stretched out my hand and he refused to shake it. Mr. Hall has a chip on his shoulder that needs to be challenged. I remain unhappy with your service. In the past I have rented storage space for 6 months, rented vehicles to move but that business will go elsewhere. I will be needing storage again but another company that can do the job correctly, that doesn't have an attitude that they were doing me a favor by poor quality work...that other company will get my business.

Having been told only 30 minutes, we took only the one car and planned to wait.  When we got there, the order was wrong, the installer not there and were told it would be 3 hours before the installation could be done  We cancelled and asked for a refund but were told the charge had not been put on our card (it had and it will take 3-5 business days to be credited back).   When I tried to voice my complaint through customer service I got cut off after nearly 20 minutes of telling my story (I think they just hung up because they didn't want to be bothered).

A paying customer should NEVER be treated this way. we ARE the reason you are in business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.  Plus you can get an additional 5% discount if you have a Home Depot credit card.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

Hours stated that they close at 4pm and I had called earlier to notify them that I was dropping the truck off that day and to verify that they had room for the dropoff of the big trunk. The app wouldn't locate the location of the uhaul place so we were unable to checkout through the app. We dropped the keys off in the 24 hour box and drove back to a northern state to finish packing up what didn't fit in the 26 foot. We got a 15 foot truck, loaded it up and returned back down south. I noticed that the 26 foot reservation did not close out online. I called and talked with guy over the phone. He said that he had closed it out, but I told him that it wasn't showing as closed out. They closed out the 26 foot uhaul on the last day of reservation at  the exact hour that it was due back. The store isn't even open that day.  I received a notification for tolls for the 26 uhaul yet I picked up a 15 foot uhaul the same day in Virginia. There is no way to be in two places at once. I mileage on both trucks should have been the same as they were driven to the same location.  The 26 foot uhaul had additional mileage on it from somewhere else, but because the date that the reservation was closed out on I had to pay for the tolls. The whole reason I made a big deal about constantly calling uhaul was because I needed a copy of the receipt so that I can get reimbursed for the move due to work. We will NEVER use uhaul again because of this and do not recommend them when businesses can't even be trusted to close out reservations when equipment is returned.  I am active duty military and I will recommended to all my fellow service members not to use this service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8891860cfcf4cca7:0xbc55870175b48d23"}

DO NOT BUY!\nWe purchased a shed 3 yrs ago. You can even call the business directly and their hold messages promise top quality craftsmenship. We told them the day we bought it that we were purchasing this to pay floor, put walls, heating and air, and create an apartment type space for my son. We were reassured and \u201csold\u201d on the quality promised and the guarantee of it they stood by with their warranty. Since buying the building for $10,000 cash 3 yrs ago, we have had two leaking doors everytime it rains for 3 straight yrs. we have utilized the warranty each time. After the 4th or 5th time of having them try and fix it (we were promised a FIX not an attempt at a fix) we said we wanted our money back. We cannot lay floor over wet floor to be ruined. The entire operation has been halted for three whole YEARS waiting on this promised fixed. We were told to give them one more chance by completely replacing the inward swinging doors with outward swinging doors. If they did not fix it, they promised they would discuss with me a possible refund or partial refund. Even a 50% refund would allow us to have a porch made. At this point however, a 50% refund keeps me connected to a crooked company. They replaced the doors and the next rain came and it was still leaking. We took pictures each time of course. So I called in about the promised conversation about a refund. I was transferred to a lady who took my number and would call me back, and I never heard from her. In the mean time they were sending out (same repair man each time) the repair man to \u201cfix\u201d it for the 5th ish time. So he did, well I just went out there and it\u2019s a soggy soaking wet mess again. This will be the SECOND time since what they called their \u201clast resort\u201d by replacing the doors. They basically told me if that didn\u2019t fix it nothing would. So I have a 10,000 box in my yard. Even the mattresses we placed out there are now ruined from the leaking doors and had to be thrown away. I\u2019m unable to use it. I called again today and they wanted to come \u201cfix\u201d it even tho they told me they had done everything they can. These floors in my opinion need to be replaced now by the doors if they\u2019re going to keep it leaking. I didn\u2019t pay for floors exposed to rain for 3 solid yrs. I asked again anout a refund and was told because the building is as old as it is, they can\u2019t do anything about it. Well, it\u2019s only as old as it is because they kept telling me they\u2019d fix it. I\u2019ve been kind and patient for 3 YRS! If they can\u2019t stand by their written warranty statement to fix and REPAIR (not bandaid) the issue of THEIR building THEY built, the I deserve a refund! When you buy a car and the engine blows each time it\u2019s replaced, you get another car under a warranty or a refund. It\u2019s called a lemon at some point. They\u2019re refuse to work with me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a1d7a67b6b50d:0x9f5d673cb3f62ac6"}

We had continued issues with billing and of course now that we informed them we had moved out, they said they couldn't do anything about the billing issues and hung up on us. Their excuse was the number of units they had made it confusing. ok, it's weird that you can't handle taking a payment that you have a contract stating once a month. I have pretty basic storage needs but wow, this place ended up being more trouble than it was worth and we pid more than we were supposed to every month.

At least try and find an actual Budget Rental Agency (rather than an independent contractor like this one) -- when I returned this nightmare to the local Budget Agency, the employees were very clear that often independent contractors rent out trucks without regard to their status simply for the money. Our experience was a NIGHTMARE. The truck was FILTHY and DAMAGED when we picked up - including the driver's side door of the cab hanging precariously with the fender flapping about. The agency simply encouraged documentation of existing damage so we would not be charged for it but were told there were no issues and to take the truck, and because we were under time constraints, we took the rental. The experience was miserable - the truck was dirty, LOUD, and dangerous. It was difficult to ensure the driver's side door was safely closed. In addition, when we hit rain during the drive, the ENTIRE CAB STARTED TO LEAK! Thankfully it didn't rain until the last 1.5 hours of the drive, since that time was spent soaking wet and freezing.  When I reached out to Customer Service, they offered a paltry 20% compensation of the base rental fee only ($44.64 offered, $223.20 rental fee) - between the rental, insurance, taxes and fees, and gasoline, we spent over $500 on this HORRID experience.

By the way, one of the other big truck rental companies only was going to provide a two day rental with limited mileage that would just barely cover the full trip.

My question is: why was the dolly even there in the first place? I had not reserved it!  And if there was something in the back of the truck, he should have opened the back and shown it to me.

My sister went into the store to complete the very routine process of accessing her storage unit. However, unbeknownst to her or anyone else, they were full and instead rerouted her reservation to Georgia. This information was not even gathered until they second attempt to receive help from the desk, for the first time we spoke to their general manager, Tavon Scott, who was at the moment in no mood to do his job. As soon as he saw that our last name did not come up in the computer, he looked at us as if we were crazy and then proceeded to profusely rid himself of all blame (\"it was the call center\") and yelled at us for becoming frustrated at the fact that we seemingly had no storage. He was completely unwilling to make up for the fault of his company in any capacity and did nothing but sit there and act annoyed at our frustration. I dropped by one last time to use the restroom and I could hear them quoting us and laughing at our situation until they saw I had come in. I was so disgusted at their attitude about their job that I marched up to the desk to get Mr. Scott's full name to write in this report, to which he replied, laughing \"You can just look up my name if you need it.\" I replied \"take care\" and he replied \"oh I will take care\" and continued to murmur something under his breath to the amusement of his coworkers. I've never held an official job to this date, but if I talked half as rudely to any customer as they did to us, I'd expect to be canned on the spot, and that's exactly what I wish upon this man, Mr. Scott. I'd equate this crew to a group of shiftless, gawky teenagers who are too immature to own up to their own shortcomings. Simply put, these insolent fools don't know how to represent a company and don't appreciate the name stitched onto their shirt. They've made a decision to be bad at what they do.

I asked them if they could help me out because I had to find somewhere to put the items because I have to be moved out by noon tomorrow and cannot move into my new place until August 15. They said they could not help me and turned me away. I will never use the company of U-Haul again. There was only one storage unit available in the city of Auburn, and it was at Uncle Bob's storage.

I\u2019ll use that term lightly. It had 156,627 miles the day of purchase. We drove to Knoxville, TN for pick up. Upon arrival the gentleman helping couldn\u2019t answer a single question about said truck. All he could tell us is that if we find a problem, to document on said form (within 72 hours) and they would have warranty fix any \u201cnecessary\u201d repairs. On the way home, we realized a few things that I would consider to be necessary repairs. 1. The air brakes were leaking air. Now for those of you that don\u2019t know, the ONLY brakes in this truck is the air brakes. It depends on a secure unit to stop this MASSIVE truck. 2. The air bags, similar to your shocks, were also faulty. This causing the body of the truck to bounce onto the frame without any cushion. 3. The check engine light came on. We immediately pulled over (20 ish miles from pick up location, they were closed so we couldn\u2019t go back) and called the salesman and let him know. He filled out the form with the concerns and sent it in. A few days later\ufffc we received a call from warranty to allow us to take said vehicle to the repair shop in Madison Alabama. They kept the truck for almost a week waiting on parts to fix the brakes, air bags, an O2 sensor, and back up camera. Once they had completed the repairs they called for us to pick up the truck. We picked up the \u201cfixed\u201d truck only to get a few miles (4.7) down the road and the check engine light came on again. We again called warranty and spoke to Heather Upchurch. She agreed for the truck to be returned to the mechanic. About 2 weeks later they called to say it was complete. Again, we go to pick up the truck. This time on the way home (Hazel Green from Madison) the truck started smoking like crazy from under the cab. Immediately we contacted the Manager of Sales, David Preston. We reported this to him and sent videos of the smoking engine. He directed us to call Warranty again. This time Heather agreed for us to take it to Southland Trucking as they are a licensed and certified International Dealer. (They are awesome y\u2019all!). Immediately they found that the windshield that Ruder installed was never glued into place, the DPS filer was completely deteriorated, the DOC filer was completely stopped up, there was an excessive fuel leak, and a bad exhaust sensor. They reported the diagnostics to Ryder Warranty.\nWarranty called the next day, and Heather stated out of the 5200.00 repairs, Ryder would pay 1/2. Now y\u2019all know me pretty well...that didn\u2019t fly. Eventually they agreed to pay for everything EXCEPT the fuel leak. They sent a paper for us to sign if we wanted ANYTHING to be completed. The rest wouldn\u2019t be fixed as we didn\u2019t specifically state a fuel leak on the form. Today we were told the repairs were completed. When Erik got there to pick up the truck he asked if they had driven it to see if the repairs had worked. The mechanic very bluntly stated that \u201cno sir! With that fuel leak, we won\u2019t even crank the truck much less drive it\u201d.\nNow, we are out $14,000 on a truck that is going to blow up at any minute. I contacted Heather and David today only to be told \u201csorry about that Mrs, Sears, we will not be having anything further to do with this truck, we kept our end of the deal\u201d. To date the truck has 157,000 miles most of which were FROM KNOXVILLE!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862657fdefd1377:0xd0ed215621b136a5"}

When it was just her and Smokey running the store,  those times were great and service was always 5 Stars, most definitely than any other store within this county. With Smokey no longer working there, I just hope they keep Nicole there because it wouldn't be the same without either 1 of them.

It is climate controlled and therefore is always a nice escape from the terrible heat during the summer, as well as a guarantee that the items in your unit will never be exposed to unsuitable temperatures regardless of the outside weather.

After a period of time during which the system detects no movement, the lights turn off and the building goes dark.
