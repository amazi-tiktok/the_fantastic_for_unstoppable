You adjusted you hrs to close earlier. That\u2019s the only adjustment that would be acceptable. I go because it\u2019s of the convenience, but I\u2019ll just make that longer drive to Walmart.

Cashier rudely told me this after canceling my request just say rude hitting the buttons hard to stop it. I don\u2019t care what the demographics are. I am a general manager to be clear.

Number one this store is never organized.  The aisles are constantly blocked by  stock and so on. Which brings me to my next issue. How is it that you constantly have stock and merchandise blocking  the aisles yet never seem to have anything? Also as for corporate if you require someone to leave their bags upfront then yall need to make sure they are safe. If it is your policy then you should take responsibility to make sure bags are secured! Just as you dont trust  your customers then why should i do so with my personal items or items already purchased?\nThis past Monday i happened to need an item and it was raining, before i could get in the door  \"you gotta take that hood off\" i knew that but i was already preparing to do so just not in the rain!. Then once i got ready to  pay for my purchases i stood at the counter 4 minutes and 32 seconds before both the cashier and manager returned to the front of the store and counter. Yes both of them saw me .. a few times standing there.. I choose not to share there discussion.

Tonight I went in and asked where I could find a green polo shirt bc I planned on being India for Halloween to make light of a situation that really hurt my feelings. To be followed around a store bc of the color of my skin. So to make matters worse after asking Carrie the manager where I could find a polo she told me the thrift store. So then I told her I was going to be India . Carrie was furious. She berated me and told me and all the other customers in the store it was their job to follow people that are stealing around dollar tree as if I was stealing . She yelled that India was doing her job and that it didn't matter which color the person was. Making it seem as if I am a thief. I'm in total disbelief bc I've known Carrie the manager for years. But the way she acted and talked to me tonight amongst other shoppers was ridiculous, mentally scarring, and just plain bad for business. I literally shop in dollar tree every single day. But this could all be changed very soon . Thanks to Carrie having a bad day. Then to make the situation my worst yet this year. I was apologizing to the cashier ringing me up telling her I knew the objectives of their job bc I was offered a management position about a year ago and had a application for the job in my car . Carrie the manager walks out and tells me to shut up and that the conversation is basically over. I said Carrie I was not talking to you I was speakkng to the cashier. I think it's sad when a person brings their personal life to work. I know Carrie has problems at home. So I told her I didn't know what she bad going on but I knew this wasn't her . Bottom line I won't be back to filbert ferry dollar tree for a while.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3b5484ea8d17:0xc75901d622479b6e"}

It is nothing to be making a purchase and the cashiers are on the phones arguing with their boyfriends.  There is another Family Dollar down the road and I will pass this one to instead shop at that one.  Family Dollar places these stores in mostly black neighborhoods, and does just enough, which is deplorable.  I should never go in a store where I am purchasing any foodstuffs and see rodents running across the floor.  Let me be clear however, there are one or two of the young ladies on staff there who do all they can to make this store better, but they are not manager, so they can only do so much.

How about you get on the other register and take care of the guests because I wanted my coupons and she was only doing her job... The nerve of her. Take that anger and frustration out on corporate or whomever is responsible for taking care of this issue.

Every time I go in it looks like a trashy warehouse with boxes blocking the isles. There is never a buggy available because employees have them for stocking.  The sad thing is it's not just this location.  Last but not least the employees are rude and unprofessional.  I have seen them on the phone eating lunch and just chilling with no worries behind the counter.  Customer service is no where in their vocabulary.  I suggest the nearest Walmart or Dollar general, they seem to take pride in customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e1c84699184b:0xd67ca84efe2d1777"}
