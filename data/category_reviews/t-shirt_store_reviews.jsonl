I wanted the corporate number but I had already left so I called them and nobody answered it was just a automatic voice.

And by all means it should have been half that time. There really weren't many people in the store. Crafts that were supposed to start at noon didn't begin till around 12:30 and the craft person was stale and thoroughly uninterested in their job. Before when we had come there was quite a bit of interaction and Mrs. Clause even came over to help.\nIt was a total waste of time coming out here. Their restaurant isn't even open anymore.

They were marked down from $44.99. I went and did about 15 more minutes of shopping and went to check out (at 0925 AM). At check out the item showed up as $44.99 and I said I would take it over to refund for them to research the price further. The associate at the refund desk stated the price was never $17.99 and there was no sign there showing it was ever that price. My wife walked back there and could you imaging the signs mysteriously vanished from the time I picked up the item at the rack to the time I went to check out. I was made to look like a liar and a cheat by the refund associate and Bass Pro. The only thing they had to say was they had mistakenly left the sales signs up from the weekend and I would have been okay with that. Instead I had to listen to the other refund associate say I was in the right and the signs were removed late but she could not make the other associate listen to her. Funny how they want to thank you for your military service one minute and then make you out to be a liar in front of other customers the next. I will no longer be shopping at the Bass Pro Spanish Fort location and I would suggest that all customers take photos of sales prices on the racks for they are to be susceptible removed at a moments notice to prove the customer is wrong and vendor is in the right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e72ad1fc5:0xde568058c6022035"}

It had been a while since I was last in there.  I have never had an issue before but this time I was there to spend some money.  I went up to look at a  rifle scope that I had been looking at online.  I went upstairs and took the long way to get there.  We were greeted properly walking in so didn't see any reason to think anything else.  We walked through the bows, then walked past the rifle racks to the scopes.  The guys working the counter were working with other customers so I looked around, I found the one I wanted to see.  In that process, I found another that I was interested in I looked up to see the status of the salespeople and they were over on the other side talking to each other and what looked to be looking at a phone behind the counter.  I left the counter went to check on kids who were by the aquarium.  We walked around and I decided I was going to get both of the scopes I found.  I went back and both salespeople were talking to one person.  So while I was waiting, I found a third scope I wanted.  The lady they were talking to left and they went back to the other end of the counter and did what they were doing before.  Now I don't like when a salesperson hovers over me, but I have worked in retail enough to at least let a customer know I am there to help.  I couldn't even get that out of them, so we walked away.  They missed a out a $4K sale.  I am not going to beg for them to help me.  They weren't busy.  The way I see it is they were just busy ignoring me.  Walking to the exit, I found a gear bag for a decent price and decided to buy it.  The man at the cash register was awesome.  If the guys at the gun counter were, Bass Pro would have sold me a lot more than a $12.99 bag.  I will go back again.

He went into the tracker boat section, spoke with two elderly gentlemen, he doesnt rememeber his name but the gentleman that let him back in the building after looking at the boats outside didnt say anything to him, just opened the door and walked away. So he approached another gentleman sitting at the desk, asked about one of the boats they had outside and about financing, the gentleman\u2019s response was if you dont have a 700 or better they wont finance you and they wont finance anything under $5000.00. Assuming because of how my husband looked that his score was under a 700. So my husband went inside and started looking at kayaks, he was up there for close to an hour and was not approached one time by a sales associate to see if he needed help, at that point he left the store. So not only did you lose a possible sale on a boat you also lost out on the sale of a kayak.

I had NO idea what to expect when I first visited and oh boy was I impressed. The store itself is packed with items and a tight fit for sure, but I am not complaining! They had everything under the sun for vinyl, crafting and blanks. The T-shirt selection is amazing, every color and size you could want at VERY reasonable prices. They have plenty of blanks from cozies, license plates, bows, children's clothing, jackets, etc etc etc! Their sublimation blanks are coming in strong as well, a great selection of 100% polyester and poly cotton blends, cups, tumblers, coasters, sublimation vinyl and more I have not even looked at yet, every time I go they have something new in to play with! Oh and the VINYL! Sooooo many options. They have a HUGE selection of permanent vinyl as well as Heat Transfer, from patters, to glitter, to just about every color of the rainbow in matte and/or glossy.\n\nNow let's talk about customer service... I do not think I have encountered such consistent good customer service in a long time. Most of the times I have visited have been fairly busy and the employees are working hard at various tasks or helping other customers. I have asked many questions about various products, inventory and have always gotten informed answers. If one person did not know they found the person who did know the answer. I was quite amazed with the effort to help me out in gaining swatches to show clients, beyond what I would have imagined. I have been in the market for a Cameo 4 and their prices were comparable but I found an online location that had it cheaper, but since I have had such great experiences I made the decision to buy local.\n\nLess than a week later the Cameo went on sale at Gator and not expecting to get a refund (Exchanges only with receipt 30 days) I sent a Facebook message to see if it was possible to get a store credit on the difference.\nI got a prompt response to come on in with the receipt during the sale. I returned with the receipt and was happily given a store credit for the difference in price. Talk about a kid in a candy store!\n\nI look forward to working with Gator Vinyl for a long time to come and would recommend them to anyone crafter or otherwise. You cannot go wrong with the exceptional customer service, reasonable prices, and an owner with a human touch.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb27501fbcfb1:0x286b5e200231d8d6"}

I thought it was rude and a little disturbing.\nNext, the prices you see on the website attached to their store are not the same as in the store. When I asked an employee about that, she denied their having a website. Her colleague interceded and said it was outdated and the prices were wrong. When I got to the cash register, I asked if I could leave the vinyl with the cashier. She asked me why. I had to explain to her that I changed my mind. Then she started mumbling and didn't respond when I said \"have a nice day.\" Of the two staff ladies, one was on her phone the whole time and the other was verbally rude. Neither smiled at me once.\nAll in all, I thought the store was well equiped but the staff rude and unprofessional. The general experience was unpleasant.

It\u2019s just annoying, and not something I would recommend to friends.\nI hope they get better at customer interactions because that could make the trips to this store and shopping experience way better.

I have never been told this at any of the other shops around town. I understand that they are a larger store and have a lot of customers, but this is terrible customer service. You never tell the customer that their request is a WASTE OF TIME. You tell them that you don't normally do this or somehting else. That being said, they did check on the shirt for me. At the end of the conversation, I thanked the person and told them that I appreciated them checking, but they shouldn't use the words WASTE TIME when talking to a customer. He said\" I didn't say that and I did go look for you\" and began to talk over me.

We have investigated the issue.  From our understanding, there has been a little miscommunication on the behalf of our rookie employee.  A lot of clothing has been moved around becuase we are opening a bigger store across the street and the new employee was having troulbe understand what you was discribing as the shirt you were looking for.  He might have been missunderstood or use the wrong communication a little. We did find he didn't communicate clearly what he meant by \"waste of time\".  We agree no one should tell you as a customer that something you want to know is a \"waste of time\". We are 100% sure that's not how he meant it because he did find what you was looking for. He also said he corrected his self put you on hold and then looked for the shirt. The employee explained it to us that he didn't want to waste your time because he didn't know where the shirt was or what it was and where to begain looking for it.  Again, you are right he should have used better words to communicate. He admitted to not knowing where to begain looking and was lost on what to say or where to begin.  He also, explained he did search the store upside down to make sure your question was answered.  He explained he answered your question after looking for over 20 minutes.  We glad he did that.  Again, thank you for taking the time to help us understand how we can better serve you. We are 100% sure he as been corrected and will be more sensitive when helping customers with inventor questions.  Let us know if anything like this happens again.
