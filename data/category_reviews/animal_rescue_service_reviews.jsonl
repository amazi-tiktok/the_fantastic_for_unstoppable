So I asked questions \u2018 What would I have to do so I can permanently adopt Dominick ? \u2018 ... Young lady told me to fill out an application so she can give it to her manager so she would be informed on what was going on. I filled out an application for him on January 26.  On my last visit, one of the ladies I had never met came to me & informed me that they sold Dominick. She told me the family that adopted both of them had FIRST wanted Dani & had to decide whether or not they would continue to get Dominick. During the time period of them coming to an conclusion, I had already spoke to the freckle lady expressing my interest. WHY continue  to sell him to a family that had to \u2018 decide \u2018 on whether or not to get him & not sell him to someone who had ALREADY displayed interest.

So today I just wanted to check to make sure they found her a good home see if I could bring her toys an if she was still there have some play time. They open at 10 am I call no answer I leave message no call back I call again for the next 2.5 hrs no answer. So I drive to the center went to the front desk an the lady ask if she could help me I said yes I drop off my puppy an I was-------- she cut me off an told me once I signed that paper she could not give out any info.

We understand things happen. That is why we are here, and as I type this, we have already taken in 11 since opening at 10am. Fortunately, we average about 50 adoptions each month and try our absolute best to save everything we can. Because of the overwhelming number of animals that come in to the staff of 8, it was set forth years ago that while you are welcome to stop in or check Facebook for those up for adoptions, the board and staff have the policy in place that once surrendered, we cannot personally discuss updates. With such a small team and upwards of 4000 souls coming in each year, it would be impossible to speak with every family. We hope that you are off to a great Summer and that you will consider adoption in the future. We, along with other area shelters, appreciate those that come back, once situations change.
