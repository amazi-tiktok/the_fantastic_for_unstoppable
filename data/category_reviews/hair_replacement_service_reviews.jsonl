I have been seen by numerous doctors from The Woman's Imaging in Denver Colorado, Slaon Kettering in New York and Johns Hopkins in Washington DC.   Every single doctor and nurse that has seen my breasts are shocked and in total surprise to see how beautiful they look and always comment on the quality of work. Every doctor has asked me who my plastic surgeon was and I am so proud to utter the name Dr. Beckenstein.   I was very happy after my surgery nine years ago but to have others comment and see the expression on their faces nine years later just makes me so happy.  Now I am quite sad the a surgeon in DC will be ruining the works of Dr Beckenstein. I wish doctor Beckenstein could be my doctor once again but asking him to fly to D.C. Is asking a little much.   In short, he is by far the best plastic surgeon you will ever encounter and for those that live in Birmingham-- you are blessed.\n\nThank you Dr. Beckenstein!!\nTonya Whittington", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb620d590a5:0xd1bd7107a39660f8"}

There was a little girl across the ocean that had been badly burned as a toddler.  As she grew, so did the scars.  Our prayer was to find a doctor that would be willing to help us help her.  My husband called Dr. Beckenstein and began to tell him of this child in need on the other side of the world and before my husband could finish the story, Dr. B said, \"I'll do it...no problem.\"  Dr. Beckenstein committed to help our family give this child something that I thought may be impossible.  He has gone beyond just being her surgeon...  He has shown us kindness beyond anything I could have imagined.  There is no one that I would trust more.  We have had approximately 14 surgeries and we have gone weekly into his office for the past 5 years.  After each surgery, the scars are being erased and I'm humbled by the gift (his surgical ability) that God has given this man.  And then, there's  his team...oh my his team...they are just like him.  Committed, professional and the kindest people I have ever met.  They are a reflection of him.  I cannot imagine going through this without Dr. Beckenstein and his entire team.
