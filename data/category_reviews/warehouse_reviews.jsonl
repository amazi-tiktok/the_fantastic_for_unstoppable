Since, he didnt' want to mess up my lawn mower, he asked me if I could call the reschedule the delivery. When I called, I got a gentleman who said well who forgot to put a pallet under it, sir idk, I don't work for you guys. He said you don't have a man at home that can just take it off off the truck, I said no sir, don't know any man strong enough to unload a  zero turn lawn mower in a crate by himself. He goes and you don't have a fork lift, again no sir, don't have one of those lying around either. He goes well guess I don't have a choice but to bring it back in and put a pallet under it, this is just rediculous. I am sorry to be a bother, but it is now day two of it suppose to be delivered and I still have no lawn mower and no contact from this company. I had to pay freight and they wanted me to do the work to unload their mistake. I called the company and was advised that my lawn mower was sitting waiting to be re loaded, but they couldn't tell me when this might happen or when it would be delivered. I don't want a phone call from this company to just give me more excuses or ask me if I could that fork lift or hulk of a man to do their job.

My lock was missing and had been replaced with a blue lock by the storage facility's site manager. The police were contacted and after the investigation there was footage of me taking items on Dec 26th 2019 but no footage of my items being taken on or before Jan 7 2020. The items taken included a large 60 inch tv (older style), deep freezer and gas grill to name a few. These are heavy items that would take some time to remove and load up from a climate controlled unit in which you must enter a door to gain access to the unit.

We purchased in mid January.  It was a special order re: fabric etc, so we did not receive until  late April.  The order was incomplete ( cushions missing).  Craig was very helpful in re ordering and getting the cushions that were missing.  Following this,  for a variety of reasons we did not get the cushions until  early June.  Within this 5 month period, I received  no phone calls from the store indicating where things were at.  I phoned many times - initially re: sofa and love seat arrival, then later re: the cushions and there arrival.  Even when they did arrive , I was not contacted , but rather found out through yet another of my enquiries.  Once everything was received and picked up , I have tried on numerous occasions to call, text,  and email the manager to discuss this situation and give my feedback, as I think it only fair to complain to the person(s) directly.

Just back order the 1 item and send me the rest of my order. I also didn't like the fact that once i get used to a sales representative, then automatically have to talk to a new one like a week later. Plus I don't like that your sales representatives puts me on hold every question i have. Why cant your your team be knowledgeable about the product. It seems like your team needs more in depth training.  And when i asked to speak to a manager they are always in a meeting or never can speak kinda irritating.
