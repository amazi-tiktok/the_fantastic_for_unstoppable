Lakeshore (Birmingham, AL) location. After arriving just on time for my 11am follow-up appointment with Dr. Richard Crittendon, and paying my $30.00 co-pay up-front, I took a seat in their waiting room. After about five minutes, I was escorted to the back patient area by a nurse who proceeded to weigh me, then take my blood pressure and my temperature. She then took me next door to an exam room to await Dr. Crittendon. \"He'll be with you in a few minutes,\" she said. I sat in that exam room for the next 55 minutes, listening to the nurses' and Dr. Crittendon's voices passing outside the door. AT NO TIME did anyone \"check in\" with me or acknowledge the doctor's tardiness. At 12:05pm, I left the room and attempted to speak with one of the four nurses at their station just outside; however, each one was seated and on the telephone. Eventually, I just explained to the receptionist that I could wait no longer (another appointment was pending), and left the building. Now, I understand that physicians are often over-booked or encounter unexpected issues with their patients, however, I do believe that a modicum of professional attention could have been paid during my almost one-hour wait. But, of course, they did have time to process my debit card for the co-pay.

Not what I was expecting for what I thought was a general \"walk-in clinic.\" I called & made an appointment to meet with Dr. Pink Fulmer.\n\nThis place exceeded my expectations. As it took a few minutes for the front clerk to check me in; it didn't take long (maybe 10-15 mins) before I was being called back. (I am a new patient). The lobby to this office is modern, has plenty of seating, and has a neat \"charging station\" for smart phone users who are running on their last fumes. :) I got called back and the young lady who took my blood pressure/weight was really nice. We talked briefly of the symptoms and she got me back into my private waiting room.\n\nIt wasn't long before Dr. Pink was in my room talking to me and asking me about my symptoms and conditions. He has a very calming and relaxing personality which puts a nervous person like me to ease. He truly seemed to care about my concerns and listened to all of my worries about my \"condition.\" He gave me a thorough examination, and even had some tests/xrays done that made me feel a lot better about what I \"thought\" was happening to my body.\n\nHe thoroughly went over my results and overall I was really pleased with he and all of his medical assisting staff. They were all really nice as I was super nervous about even being there. (I rarely go to the doctor). I also ended up getting a flu shot while I was there, and the girl who did it (med assistant) was sweet and did the deed quick and painless.\n\nI was sad to learn that Dr. P. Fulmer will be retiring sometime this year; but I really liked this office and will give their other doctors a shot. Fast and convenient!\n\nI also visited their in-house pharmacy (Rx Pharmacy) and I was thoroughly pleased. They were extremely quick and you can't get any better than picking up your prescriptions up at the same time you saw your doctor. It was cheap and the Pharmacy Owner (can't remember his name) was so down to earth and really pleasant to deal with.\n\nOverall, really pleased with this medical experience and glad to know I have this great place so close to where I live!! :) My husband and I will be using them as our PCP.\n\n**Side note** They also do walk-in's!! So if you are considering this as a walk-in option; try it. It's just as good (in my opinion better!!) than your typical \"American Family Care!\"\n\nThanks MEDHELP LAKESHORE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919257e0ece15:0xdc0c6a1e158e008f"}

Once your insurance company pays its contracted portion, you will receive a statement in the mail explaining the portion your insurance paid and what (if any) balance is your responsibility.

My wife and I were traveling to another country and had to have detailed information on a Covid test. We were very specific with what we needed when we were being tested and assured that we would receive this. When we went to pick up our results on Friday, 9/18, we were handed a document that I could have created on Microsoft Word with a faded letter head. When we asked about what we were told being included, the office staff acted incredibly put out and irritated about our request. They hand wrote all of the information on the incredibly unprofessional document and said that was the best they could do. I went back to the office the next day where I found Tara at the front desk. After explaining our situation, Tara empathetically addresses the situation and provided me with the exact document that we had to provide to customs for our trip. I was in the office for less than 5 minutes and got exactly what I needed. Why this required two trips is confusing, but if not for Tara, we would have missed our deadline for travel approval, all because of the laziness and lack of customer service we received from the staff present on 9/18, including the assistant manager. Tara was by far the most professional employee we dealt with from multiple phone calls, to 3 visits at Southern Immediate Care in Anniston.

I left with out any real diagnosis and a prescription for an antibiotic and a cough medicine. The cough medicine had absolutely no effect and after finishing to round of antibiotics there was no change in my cough and it has only gotten worse. I called up there to see if they could potentially reexamine me. Unlike every other urgent care that I have ever been to they told me I would be charged a copay to be reexamined. If I had known this was their policy I would have gone to an urgent care in Auburn like I usually do as they care more about me getting better than me paying a copay and don't charge one for reexaminations. They did call in a new cough medicine prescription however it is a decongestant even though I have absolutely no congestion symptoms. It was also not covered by my insurance so I was forced to pay out of pocket. I will not be returning to this urgent care in the future.

We had the best experiance possible. The CRNP Troy Wilcoxson was awesome! We told our friends about what a great experiance we had, and recommended the establishment to others.\nSo today, December 23 I took my daughter back to get tested for Covid 19, since our test were positive.\nIn my 48 years I have only experienced two other so called CRNP's as bad as the Donna Conway treated me today.\nShe bad mouthed Mr. Wilcoxson in how he practices and the decisions he makes. I pleaded to her to change my daughters prescription over to what my husband and I were taking which is not against the law nothing illegal and she could have totally made me feel better as mother and understand ultimately I know my daughter best, she is not just a math equation.\nEverything I said to her she used words like \"debunked\", when I am the paying customer.\nI was shocked.\nJust because what I was requesting did not fall into her agenda and I pleaded with her, she chose not to make me assured as a parent my daughter is getting  the right treatment. Not to mention she wrote my daughter for an inhailer and no one even listened to her lungs. Using an inhailer when you don't need it can cause more damage than good.\nAfter I stated that fact, she then listened to my daughters lungs and said she sounded clear.\nI am so appalled by her lack of bedside manner and inability to connect with the concerns and needs of the patients.\nOn our previous visit we were invited to sign the kiosk about our experience. Today Donna Conway made sure to skip that option. When I asked the front desk receptionist to please load the kiosk for me it only allowed me to enter 1 as my satisfaction, when I went type the reason why, someone conveniently shut it off and the receptionist could not reload it.\nSo there's that.\nIf this Donna Conway continues to be employed at your establishment, I will make it my daily mission to make sure through ALL of my media connections that people call first and only visit the Care Center when Troy is working.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889046071922300f:0x23b6c7003fb99cdc"}

Ok??? If we knew his results we wouldn't have called to ask for it and wasted your and mine time.

She told me that she'd have to refer me to an Endodontic office so that they can fix what she messed up and assured me that everything would be refunded since they didn't finish the job/procedure.

Thus,  they were blocking the way for possible elederly and/or people with special needs. I was told they were busy and hence why it took so long.  I heard people come and go through those hours I was in my room.\n\nAnyways,  she did what she could and did help my toe some and the pain has died down  but i was over charged and unfairly charged for the blood work. The employees should inform their patients what and why they are being charged.

The nurses are instructed to run order tests (technically under the doctor's orders) before the doctor actually speaks to or looks at you -  this happened to me multiple times. Each time, a nurse has told me that the test are \"protocol\" and I can't turn them down - after I signed a patient's bill of rights, containing a clause stating that a patient can refuse any medical care - which is federal law. I had to argue with a nurse to turn down a chest x-ray for a minor sore throat. First, I asked why- she said that it will detect bronchitis. A quick google search told me that it bronchitis shows up on a chest x-ray about 25% of the time. It also informed me that I didn't have any symptoms of bronchitis. Turns out that they also ran a completely unnecessary white blood cell count test, which the doctor told me would not have affected his treatment, regardless of the result (after the fact). The doctor actually looked at me after this ordeal. He was able to tell me that I had an ear infection after a 2-minute physical examination. None of the three protocol tests were in any way necessary.\n\nIn a separate incident, there was another minor sore throat that had persisted for 2 weeks, accompanied by a couple bumps under the tongue. The nurse followed protocol and said they were running 3 tests, including a strep test. I declined this, only to be told in an extremely rude manner - by a different nurse this time -  that it is \"protocol\" and I can't change protocol. I reminded her that her protocol is internal, and it can certainly be deviated from. In fact, it is federal law.\n\nMy insurance company was actually billed for the 2nd incident (I was billed for a small portion as well). I went to the office to request a refund for myself and my insurance company - only to be told by the head nurse that they can't do it. Of course after digging deeper - she literally meant that they can't refund, but their billing company can. This was only the beginning of the battle of semantics. She also told me that she I can't speak to her manager, because she is the head nurse and the manager. After discussing further, I learned that she does have a boss (surprise!). She finally agreed to email him/her and have them contact me the next day. That was a week ago...\n\nPlease understand that this is one of the most important factor in rising health care costs and boycott this place. I have also been to North Alabama Medical Care in south Huntsville twice, and although they do try to pull some BS- it is not nearly to this degree. They actually have the doctor look at you before running unnecessary tests.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626570ddaf8711:0x2c74e56f00a3cb0e"}

Where do I start with the utter inconvenience of a visit this has been? The phone call: I decided that I would attempt to book an appointment (like a normal human being) and avoid wasting half of my day to be treated for a basic clinical diagnosis. This business doesn\u2019t take appointments for some reason (because they\u2019re stuck in a 1900\u2019s complacency mentality). Thereafter, I walked into the waiting room and there were only 3 visitors in total (including myself). No surprise there, given the fact that this place is a nightmare. I was rudely informed that I needed to fill out administrative work regarding my visit, and I asked if they already had my file (since I have been here before). They continued to explain that my file was old (it wasn\u2019t) and I needed to update information (not true). Around 1 hour later I was informed that INFORMATION was finalized.

He was told when he had to go back that it would only be $50 if it was just for his medicine refill and nothing else ( and this is a med he has been taking for about 7 years and he can't go without it). But when he went back they charged him $175 (even more than the first visit). He is on SSDI and doesn't receive Medicare yet so he has to pay cash! I think this is ridiculous to charge that much just to get a medication refill and not have anything else done! You would think they could have a little compassion on someone that is disabled and living just off Social Security and has low income! And the visit only took the time it took for the Dr to write it out!

She preformed an incision and drainage procedure with very little numbing agent. When I expressed this via my screams in pain , she didn't care. She just had people hold me down to the table.

I asked the nurse who brought out my paperwork if I was going to see a doctor and she talked to me as if I were a nuisance. I let it ride as I assumed she was having a bad day. I received a phone call a few minutes later requesting a phone triage. I asked the young lady to send someone out due to taking another call from the hospital for an emergent matter. The original moody nurse came back out and reached through my window attempting to snatch my paperwork out of my hands. Suggested I go somewhere else and called me ignorant. I asked what her problem was and asked to complete my visit and she continued belligerently yell at me in the parking lot. Literally told me to leave and stop filling out paperwork. Another lady came out about the same time I asked for her superior. The second lady was the office manager and the younger nurse seem to have no regard for her attitude or behavior, even in front of her boss. Mind blown at the actions and behavior of the some of the staff at this facility. The office manager was understanding and compassionate to the situation and took the time to explain the visit due to sick symptoms. Visit with actual dr was pleasant as well.

I was handed a prescription for Tamiflu, which I had already declined, and a bill for about $85. I asked this person to appeal to the \"Doctor\" to at least prescribe some cough medicine, which she did. It was ineffective. I spent $85 for this woman to fail to give me a diagnosis and then fail to give me any treatment to reduce symptoms. The visit was worthless.

My granddaughter had fever, sore throat and body aches.  I had severe headache and body aches as well. I had looked up and noticed AFC was open at 8am and was very thankful. (We arrived around 8:30) Only 2 cars in the parking lot at the time.  As we were signing in,  one person came out that had been seen by the NP that was on call.  I was finally taken back to be triaged and put in a room.  My daughter and granddaughter were still in waiting room for another 10 mins or so before they were taken back to be triaged and put into a room.\n\nOnce in a room, I waited for a little while and the NP came in and saw me.  She was great! She told me someone would be in to swab me for the flu and strep. Head hurting, lying on the bed...all I heard was talking and laughing coming from the nurses station.  Waited for what seemed like forever...still no one shows up to check on me.  I go to the restroom across the hall from my room and came back out to the nurses sitting at the station talking about Thanksgiving, shopping, etc. I then asked if my orders to be swabbed had been sent to them.  They all opened their laptops and said oh yes, here it is. \"Someone will be with you in a moment\".  Then a moment of silence from them and then the chattering back and forth began again.\n\nA couple of minutes later the nurse that came in was Kia, very sweet and kind.  I had not met or even saw her until she came into do the swab. She did apologize for the delay and said that she had previously been in with another patient. I laid my head back down and then texted by daughter a few minutes later and asked her if my granddaughter had been swabbed as well.  She said she had not been.  I then went back outside my door and asked if anyone had been in to swab by granddaughter and was told yes...without even giving them her name at first. My daughter heard them bold face lie to me.  I told them that I knew that no one had been in there to swab her and expected it to be done ASAP because she was very sick. A \"professional\" to lie to my face is repulsive.\n\nAgain Kia, was the nurse sent into the room to do the swab.  After the test came back on me, a totally different nurse came into the room and gave me my shots.  I never saw one of the ones sitting at the desk again.  That is where they stayed.  My granddaughter finally received her diagnosis as strep and was also given a shot.  The shot was given by Kia.\n\nWhere were all the other nurses that had nothing to do but sit around the desk and chit chat all morning?  For us being the only patients there during all of this time, it should not have taken 2 hours. I don't mind waiting at all if there is a good reason but this particular day and location, there was no reason for this to be a 2 hour visit.  This is what will happen you have a full staff on hand but only a couple of them are actually working.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1575311025373, "text": "Our manager would really like to speak with you more regarding this matter.

Do not waist your time and money, but  seriously they lack in knowledge and experience!\n.\nThey misdiagnosed my shingles with contact dermatitis..... and said my other symptoms of the shingles was due to a sinus infection.... sent me home with steroid shot, an itching med., steroid pack, and antibiotic.\n\nThey drew blood and said that my WBC was on the rise ( like they had been charting it over time), instead of saying my white blood count was elevated. Anyway she said that was from my sinus infection.\nThe shingles will also make your WBC go up.\n\nOn another occasion, my husband fell late in the evening and not sure why he stopped into AFC, but they sent him  home and told him that there was nothing wrong with it.  Long story short he still has problems with that shoulder. He ended up tearing a muscle.\n\nNeedless to say, I will never go back to AFC Bessemer/McCalla location.\nTrust me go to the next red light and  take a left and go to Middle Creek Medical Center. I\u2019ve never had a bad experience, or peronally heard of a bad review from them. My whole family has went to them and the ONLY reason I stopped into AFC this time was because I drove to Middle Creek and they had closed early this day. And I was feeling so bad.

After two full days, my daughter has not gotten any better, I would even venture to say she\u2019s gotten worse. Checking over the antibiotic that was prescribed, I called the pharmacy where her last prescription was filled (which happened to be the exact same antibiotic for another ear infection she had). Only difference was the one that was prescribed to us at AFC was HALF the dose.. so it has done my LO absolutely no good up to this point. So now I\u2019m forced to call my pediatrician back tomorrow and see if she will give another script (which I\u2019m sure insurance will not pay for again in the same week- irrelevant because I will do what I have to do to get her better).

I've been to the other Urgent care centers in the area several times and have never experienced the issues I had at American Family Care in Daphne.\nI waited a very, very long time to be seen, and there were only two or three other patients in there. The nurse wasn't very confident with his blood drawing skills and didn't seem very knowledgeable. Then, I drove all the way to the pharmacy to find out they never called my prescription in!! The office closed at 6, and it was 6:20pm when I realized this. I was told by the answering service I had to wait until tomorrow to call and get it sent over. I was very unhappy that I had to wait another day to get my medications. I felt horrible and needed the antibiotics asap! I will never go back here!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1529587638309, "text": "Hi Lindsey, thank you for taking the time to let us know about your recent experience.

I was told by one of the office personnel that \"for insurance plans with high deductibles we charge $100.\" In my insurance booklet from BCBS it says my Co pay for an urgent care center is $50. After telling her that we have a $300 per person deductible, she told me I was wrong and that my deductible was $7800 or $7900 which isn't true. If I could post photos of our State Employee Insurance Board book from BCBS Alabama it plainly states that we each have a $300 per person deductible per calendar year, I would. We have a $7800 Maximum out of pocket cost for one person and $14500 for a family, but she clearly stated deductible. I'm going to assume they were talking about our maximum out of pocket costs instead of deductible, but even then, that shouldn't be something that urgent care centers even consider.\n\nI went to Eastern Shore Urgent Care Center in November or December and they didn't bill me $100 for seeing the doctor. I paid a $50 copay. I am going to go back to that one even though it is out of my way. Always be sure to look at your insurance booklet and read it every year for updates. There are some doctors offices and urgent care centers that will try to charge you more.\n\nEdit: I went to Eastern Shore Urgent Care center and my co pay was $35. I called and confirmed with BCBS that my deductible isn't in the $7000s. I'm not sure if she misread my insurance or what happened, but I shouldn't have to pay extra for services that my insurance MIGHT not cover. They are basically saying that they are going to charge you extra because you may not pay your bill for services rendered so we will have an account. I would rather go to an urgent care center where I'm billed a Co pay and then sent a bill for extra services that my insurance didn't cover.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1549662264015, "text": "Kelsey Herring, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.

The test used (Abbott ID Now) has a near zero false positive rate when a qualified technician runs the test. The AFC clinician I saw also told me that there was no way it was a false positive. However, I was told by a clinician at one of my follow up tests that the only way to get a false positive on the Abbott now protocol is if the sample is contaminated or if samples are mixed up. From this, I concluded that the AFC clinician/technician made a mistake, one that was quite costly for me both financially (I spent $450 in follow up testing) and emotionally (I feared I had exposed my elderly parents). I would recommend using a different clinic for a rapid test.\n\nI was also disappointed in their safety protocols vis-a-vis Covid. The front office staff's mask compliance is very poor (some without masks, others with it below the nose), and they have all patients congregate at the check in.

I am an active duty service member. Our family is insured with Tricare Prime which covers 100%. My wife goes to this clinic because the location is convenient and the clinicians are great. Two weeks ago we received a letter from American Family Care stating that the amount of $54.66 has been sent to collection. I was shocked. Called the clinic and they give me the number for billing the department. Call the billing department and one of the lady who happened to be super rude picked up the phone after I waited 45 min told me that the amount of $54.66 we owned is the deductible. I tried to explain to her that with Tricare Prime there is no out of pocket cost at all. She told me to call Tricare and ask one of the Tricare representative to give her a call. Called Tricare, the representative from Tricare said that they are a receiving call center only, they don't make call out to other people. Asked Tricare about that $54.66, they explained to me that the billing department from AFC mess up the claim. Instead of filling the claim under my regular PCM, they filed it under another physician who wasn't a primary care physician at that time. That's why Tricare didn't process the entire claim amount. Instead of reprocess the claim, no one from AFC ever go back to take a look at the claim but instead decide to bill me the remaining amount. Tricare advise me to call AFC and make a conference call while everyone is on the line so Tricare rep can walk someone from AFC billing department through how to reprocess the claim to resolve the problem. Called back to AFC billing department and talk to someone name David. I explained the entire process to him again and he said he will make some note and transfer the case over to someone who can resolve the problem and I should expect a call back either later that day or the day after. Guess what, today is 2 weeks later and still haven't heard anything from them. Tried to call the \"patient advocate\" number from whoever gave the number to Carol Peppers on the comment below and just as I expected \"the number you have called can no longer received voice mail\".

I spent most of the visit wishing I had gone / thinking about going somewhere else. I grew up in Vestavia, and this was one of many poor experiences I've had at that location over the years. About 10 years ago I had a nurse insert the blood draw needle upside down! Meaning, she put it in to where the tip of the needle was pointing towards my wrist. Absurd. I was right near it and looking for a urgent care when I went in this week. It didn't take me long to remember why I stopped going there. Also, I've read multiple negative reviews about Dr. Brentnall, and I'm here to add another. I was there with a cold and an unrelated YI. He asked me, \"Well, about that, we can't still get in to see our lady doctor, right?\" It was very dismissive, rude, and awkward. He really didn't pay any attention to what I had to say. He ordered a step test when I had clearly explained I knew the only reason my throat hurt was sinus drainage. The only thing he did listen to was my self-diagnoses. After much wasted time and unnecessary labs, he came in with a prescription for an upper respiratory infection and a YI - exactly what I told him I thought I had.

This was a truly baffling experience, and you should only come here if you want you symptoms ignored or to be immediately referred to an allergy specialist for cold / strep throat symptoms.\n\nHere's a quick list of things that Dr. Brentnall did or said to prevent me from ever coming back here again. I came in after my cold symptoms worsened for 5 days with no sign of improvement plus I had developed a bad sore throat and dizziness:\n\n- He treated me like a child. He grabs the instrument to look in my mouth, ears, and nose. He stares at me for a second then says, \"I can see better if you open your mouth.\" Are you serious?? How about you ask me to open my mouth? For all I know you're going for my nose!\n- \"your nose is red. Looks like you're bothered by the ragweed\". Proceeds to talk about an allergist he recommends and a medication etc. I have had allergies since I was 13, and they are under control. I know what allergies are, and this is not allergies. How about my nose is red because I've had COLD SYMPTOMS FOR 5 DAYS!?\n- He never asks about my symptoms. I had to force them on him by blurting them out when he walks in for the 4th or 5th time he's come in the room (usually to talk about allergies some more). He dismissed them all as either being allergies, my IBS (which is also under control), or a side effect of medication I've been taking for 6 YEARS! I have never had a negative reaction to this medication. I know it can start at any time, but what are the odds of all of these things happening at once rather than I actually have a bad cold, or the flu, or something else?!\n- He sat on the bed with me twice.... I was very uncomfortable. He should have grabbed a chair since there were practically no other patients in the entire office.\n- I cannot count the number of times he talked about allergies or particles in the air.\n- He tried to trick me into taking allergy medication. He vaguely described what it was when he listed the meds, and never said it was for allergies. I only found out when the pharmacist mentioned it. I already take a daily OTC allergy medication. I DO NOT HAVE AN ALLERGY PROBLEM!\n\nI'm really curious to know if he treats all of his patients this way or if it is just the female patients. Also, does he get some kind of kick back from the number of people he refers to this allergist?? My boyfriend and I left that place completely furious. Every time Dr. Brentnall left the room, we would rant to each other. I believe the staff could hear us through the door each time, and I really hope they did.\n\nI will say the only positive was the pharmacist. She was knowledgeable yet eager to learn when I told her I needed gluten free medications due to celiac. And there was no way I was going to get that allergy medication filled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889220ea1374f87:0xf88c51cd3ebb99d0"}

He has been suffering from pain in his foot for over two months but could not afford a doctor's appointment. He doesn't have insurance and is working really hard to get back on his feet after a difficult period in his life. The pain finally got so bad that it is shooting up his leg and he is having trouble walking so he decided he had to go. The appointment was a little over $180. The nurses didn't know how to use the computer system. They asked him the same questions and what his name was over and over. One of the nurses smelled so badly of body odor that I could smell her as I was following her down the hall. My friend was gagging while she attempted to take his blood pressure. It took several tries. Finally, we got into a room. The doctor (Caroline Feist) came in and asked what the problem was. She seemed skeptical like she did not believe him. I'm sure she sees many people seeking pain meds and is therefore skeptical, but he never asked for pain pills. He described the problem and how it was affecting his job and how it developed. She touched the area of his foot, lightly, with two fingers (no thorough exam) and sent him to get x-rays. Once the x-rays came back, she told him they didn't show anything and that there were many reasons he could be in pain (she didn't say what any of these reasons were). He asked what he should do: sturdy shoes, orthotics, compression, ice? She said to do whatever he would like to do, wrote him a prescription for anti-inflammatories, and said to go see his primary care physician. He can't afford another doctor visit. Now he has lost a day's wages plus $180 for nothing and will not be able to pay his bills. Dr. Feist demonstrated a lack of empathy and professionalism and strong skepticism throughout the visit. Do not visit this doctor; just set $200 on fire. You'll get the same medical care, you'll get to burn something, and you won't be treated like a piece of crap.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889220ea1374f87:0xf88c51cd3ebb99d0"}

I just don\u2019t think if it\u2019s up to me we will be back. I know I was not satisfied at how she was treated.

However, I have been seriously disappointed the last few times I've been to this facility. First and foremost, the Friday before Easter, I was ill and needed to come in for antibiotics. My fiance and I arrived at 7:15 only to find them closed. AFC used to be quick- in and out in an hour. As I write this I've been sitting here for an hour in the lobby. Haven't even been called back to triage or a room yet. Not to mention, when I checked in and paid my copay the receptionist tried to discourage me from being seen. \"If you get tired of waiting, we will refund your money.\" I asked if there was a long wait, she stated that the doctor was only seeing seven patients at a time and that there were seven in the back already and \"five thousand\" in the lobby. After this, I watched the same receptionist pseudo turn away three more people, discouraging them to check in because of the \"long wait\". All three left, one a teenage girl with her mother, limping and in tears. If people come here, they obviously have a reason. This is a facility that is designated to help ill and injured people, and if that impedes your off time, then so be it. Most people in the working world have to stay late from time to time. Good workers still do their job. Also, the doctor may only be seeing 7 patients at a time, but there are more than 7 rooms in the facility. Instead of having people that are already unwell sit in the uncomfortable lobby chairs for hours at a time, they could move people to the vacant rooms so they could be more comfortable. Even still, this location always seems to be this busy so why on earth is there only one doctor on staff? Makes no sense. The last few times I have been in this facility for either me or my fiance, we have had to wait for at least two hours. There was one occasion that we didn't get out until almost 10pm, at which point I would have had to drive 25 minutes to get to a pharmacy that would be open and able to fill my scripts. I've been to Shelby ER and have been taken to a room faster than this. More to follow....\n\nUpdate: 1.5 hours. Still in the waiting room. Still with two patients in front of me.\n\nBack in a room. Angelise triaged me. She's a doll. Best part of this experience so far. She has great communication skills and was still upbeat even with it being 8:45 by the time I was triaged.\n\nTook me another hour to see the doctor, Dr. Habert. I could tell what the holdup was when he spent a lot of time chatting with us in the room. I didn't mind that so much. Its better than seing a doctor for less than a minute when you wait for hours. What I did mind was being told that my diagnosis, walking pneumonia, was a result of dairy products. Now, to be clear, I didn't have an issue with this and I heard him out at the time, but by the time I got home, I researched it, and couldn't find any correlation or any research to support his statements... He was very nice and had a great bedside manner. But maybe we shouldn't be misinforming patients?

My grandmother had fell causing her lip to bust open and was in need of stitches, so this medical facility was the closest and hopefully cheapest choice, But on arrival i was treated with such disrespect. I checked her in and give the nurses my grandmothers information and helped her back, but i wasn't allowed any further, so I go to wait in the lobby and waited for an hour. I go to ask how my grandmother is doing but the nurses acted like they didnt know what i was talking about so i ask how much longer was it going to be and they ignored me so i go back to sit and waited for another hour. I go up to ask about my grandmother again only to be given the same response as before, I get frustrated so i go out to check on my car, and as i was trying to come back to the lobby the doors were locked. I was locked out in the cold and had no idea what condition my grandmother was in so I knocked on the door until a nurse noticed and she just stood there staring at me. I wave her over but she ignored me and went back behind her desk.I dont know why i was treated like this but i can only come up with that my skin color wasn't white (all the nurses were white). It was 15 degrees out so i went back and waited in my car. A few minutes go by i see a cop car come by and he parks in front of the building like he got a call, and then i see him looking around the whole building for somebody (im guessing me). But i stay in my vehicle until he leaves. After all that i see my grandmother finally come out after 4 hours of waiting. Again i illiterate: i dont know why they treated me like a second class citizen but i guess its cause im not white.\n\nIn summary: This medical facility locked me out and called the police on me for my skin color.

I have to get any dental procedures approved through Medicare, which by the way doesn't happen the same day (usually a 72 hour turn around, even then you are not guaranteed approval).  I had an infection and had eaten an entire bottle of 20 Alleve in about 48 hours.  I entered the facility expecting just average level of concern and kindness.  What I encountered when I got there was anything but that!  The front office staff was so nice and professional!  However, the best was yet to come!  The nurse who called me back and took my vitals was just such a lovely young woman. The EPITOME of professional, kind and sympathetic that one would look for while in pain visiting ANY doctor's office, but often never receiving.   Then, Dr. Pike entered the room.  I have seen Dr. Pike before while I was sick, and he was always professional.  Maybe, I am being swayed by the amount of discomfort I was in, but this doctor acted as if he were a concerned family member!!    I was SO IMPRESSED WITH MY VISIT FROM THE SECOND I ENTERED THE BUILDING UNTIL I LEFT!  I do have a PCP who practices several cities away.  Whenever I cannot get into his office (AND NOT RECEIVE THE KIND OF CARE LIKE I DID AT AFC-ALABASTER) I will more than definitely return here and also WOULD HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!  I PROMISE, YOU WILL BE SATISFIED.  If not, you might want to check out the Brookwood Hospital..........PSYCHE UNIT that is!!!  :-)  :-)   :-)        I also ready the review below by a Miss Cheyenne.......JUST REMEMBER some folks come in with a bad attitude or being rude or just looking for pain pills............Those types of people make it rough on everyone.......even the other patients waiting to see the doctor.........If you have once ounce of decency in your body, there is no way you would get treated in such a manner.  Her comment is disgusting and sounds like she did not get what she was after.  Doctors and staff are trained to recognize drug seeking behaviours in folks....If you are truly there for a medical problem, you will be treated with as much respect as you give to others.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888925f2a0e6e081:0x276e4bd15fdc49e4"}

The nurse and the medical assisant run this place!\nNow, The NP was barely even in the room with me.  The medical assistant was still checking my bp and had not taken any labs yet and then another one came in with a steroid shot and antibiotic shot. So I was being given two shots as treatment YET NO LABS HAD BEEN DONE. SO what exactly what she treating me for? Strange to recieve shots before labs....and then she never even came back in the room...the medical assistant walked in and mumbled something about take your meds and went to leave. I had to stop him and ask him what medications I was given and what my test results were. He then had to go and ask the NP and try to get an answer and came back and mumbled ok follow me...next thing i knew i was being pushed out the door and i had no idea what meds i was given or where to pick them up. I stopped him and he had to go back and ask the NP AGAIN....all of this could have been prevented had she seen me and given me the results to begin with like a dr should. he comes back 20 min later and tells me that my meds got sent to calera and they got them changed to alabaster. only thing i was given was a Zpack. i was miserable for several days and could not sleep so i finally went to another urgent care and recieved the care i needed. I was also told I had a raging UTI and that zpac would not touch it....so they gave me Bactrim....so the NP ran all these tests on me and even my urine but didnt follow through.  I will not be back. After Dr G & Dr Pike left it has just been awful. I tried to continue to use AFC alabaster but after this experience...i WILL NOT. and I will be putting this review on google.\n\nDecided to give them one more shot....went to visit last week because I was extremely sick....i mean EXTREMELY......imagine my surprise when the same NP came in ...and provided the SAME horrible service...talked down to me like I was an idiot....same responses as my last visit.....same meds....no blood drawn....left me in the room for over 2 hours for two simple tests and then nothing.....just came back in, gave me a shot, and pushed me out the door. I am done with this place. I will never be back and it looks like that is the same for alot of people because there was no one in the waiting room...never saw another patient while i was there... I wont be surprised if the place shuts down before long. You can only treat people like idiots for so long before they return the favor. Sorry not sorry.

Normally, if I end up leaving a review it is because I have experienced a dissatisfaction on numerous of occasions. Which, in this instance, is accurate yet again. Main Street is considerably close to my home and therefore mine and my families first stop. However, over the passed several months I have been very ill on-and-off. After being sick for nearly a week, I finally decided to make a trip to just try to get better. I was tested for both the strep and flu. However, both came back negative. This is a typical situation result when I come here. The last several visits I have been diagnosed with a \u201csinus infection\u201d, upper respiratory infection etc. When their PA told me last night I was negative again for flu and strep, with full knowledge knowing I 100% have both, I got incredibly frustrated. I told their PA, after she said it was probably just a sinus infection, that every time I come here that is what they diagnose me with. I have had to pay multiple doctors bills because of their misdiagnoses and having to seek out another doctor to properly diagnose me. To which each time, when I get tested elsewhere, it comes back positive. They said they gave me a \u201cshot\u201d to help speed the pain in my throat, and it is 5:30 in the morning and the pain in my throat is so severe there is ringing in my ear now which has woken me up in even more pain. So, once again I will have to pay ANOTHER doctor to diagnose me with what I know I have. This is incredibly exhausting. I don\u2019t know if it is malfunctioning testing machines or the lack of actual experienced doctors, but the fact that I have been awaken in such severe pain and body aches let\u2019s me know I once again did not receive the treatment I needed. With all of that said, the PA who was there did call me in a prescription for both the flu and strep after I complained I was tired of their diagnosis's continuously being that of a \u201csinus infection\u201d. I know if I let a good 48-72 hours of these medication stay in my system I will get better. The problem is, I am in so much pain and the shot they \u201cgave\u201d me might have well been water.\n\nSincerely,\nA extremely tired sick person", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1582566404885, "text": "Hi Shannon,\n\nThank you so much for reaching out.

I also knew that I was dehydrated. The only thing that I didn\u2019t know was that my blood pressure was elevated probably because of the flu.  I also had a severe headache which I assumed was associated with the dehydration and flu. I am quite sure the nurse practitioner could hear the rattling in my back whenever she listen to me breathe, however, she did not order an x-ray to see if I had pneumonia or walking pneumonia. I have been running 102 to 103 fever for the fourth day as well. The fever had gone down when I went in because I had just taken Tylenol before going. She gave me a prescription for some little pill for my throat and a pill for nausea.  She did nothing for my dehydration. I should\u2019ve had an x-ray to see if I have pneumonia so that I could\u2019ve been given an antibiotic. I feel like it was a complete waste of my time and money. I had to sit and wait a long time very sick in a waiting room full of sick people basically be told nothing more than I already knew and left there was nothing to make me feel better. I told her that I did not want to leave there under those conditions; however, that is what happened. Now, tomorrow I am probably going to have to go to another urgent care or emergency room to get the care and attention I need.  The receptionist was continuously sending people away telling everyone that came in after I was there that it was just too long of a wait so everybody would leave and say they would come back later. Possibly, they might\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the amount of people they had, however, when I got there I asked how long the wait would be and she told me there was only four people ahead of me.

UHC gave them the number to verify the insurance, only they couldn\u2019t complete the process because they had no idea what their OWN tax ID number was! They needed this to complete verification through the automated process. After much frustration, I called UHC customer service back and the kind lady spoke with the man at the front desk DIRECTLY. They insisted they HAD to have the physical card. She explained they only needed verification and there was no more information on the card than what we had already provided (my Member ID number, the group number, and my Drivers license.) However, they DID need their own tax ID to complete the automated process which neither of them knew and neither bothered to investigate further (perhaps asking the doctor?!) Frustrated by their ignorance, she finally suggested I go elsewhere for medical  attention and mentioned for all to hear she had NEVER heard of anyone needing the physical card when they were clearly verifying coverage for me.

I went into this AFC because I have been feeling ill with sinus pressure and body aches. Everything was quick and easy at first, I got signed in, filled out my paperwork, paid my copay, and in less than 10 minutes, I was in the back getting my vitals done and such. The nurse was very nice and thorough. Then I met the doctor. I didn't catch his name, as he didn't introduce himself. Rather, he walked into the door and commented that I had gained 15 pounds since my last visit. (Keep in mind, I'm here for my cold symptoms) He asked if I was okay with this. (I'm not even remotely overweight or unhealthy) Then he comments on my acne and asks what I'm doing about it. I have hormonal acne and it will flare up when I'm sick or for other reasons. These two things had absolutely nothing to do with why I was here and it left me feeling embarrassed and ashamed. My primary care doctor is who I would talk to about those things, not an Urgent Care doctor. I would understand if it had anything to do with why I was there, but it had nothing to do with it. I will never be back to this location because I would rather not be made to feel embarrassed and humiliated, especially when I already don't feel well physically.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1576511424595, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback about your experience with us.

I tell her my symptoms and she looks at my ears, throat, and listens to my breathing. She quickly orders the flu test and walks out. The nurse student says that the test will take about 15 minutes and she swabs my nose. I wait for a total of 48 minutes until some other nurse walks in, hands me a paper that says Influenza Type A on it and tells me to read it. She then walks right back out without seeing if I had questions (which I did!). While I waited, I could hear the nurses and doctors sitting there talking about their lunch plans and weekend plans, not doing their jobs. Also, after about 20 minutes of sitting in the room, I hear the nurses start talking about how my flu test was positive, and they were being super loud about it. That is a HIPPA violation! I then wait another 15 minutes for the student nurse to walk back in and give me my perscriptions and school excuse. Not once did anyone bother to come in and tell me I had the flu and bronchitis or to see if I had any questions. On top of it all, I heard the doctors outside my door arguing about whether or not I could continue to take the Tamiflu with my iron pills, and they still never told me if I should or should not take the Tamiflu and my iron pills.

I was quickly taken back as very few people were there.  Once in the back I was swabbed for strep.  When the doctor came, he stated I did not have strep.  He Check my ears, nose, and lungs and told me I had drainage that was making my throat hurt.  He never looked in my throat.  He gave me a steroid shot and a week of amoxicillin. Over the next days I got worse.  After visiting another doctor, it was determined  that I had a bacteria in my esophagus and needed to be treated with a different class of an antibiotic.  Here is my review:  after a $50 co-pay, the doctor spent less than 2 minutes with me, doing a very poor job of considering all the possibilities for my sore throats and just treating me like I had a sinus problem.  He never looked at the back of my throat to see that it was not inflamed and the problem with further down in my esophagus.  I will never go back.

Only rating it this well because of the wonderful reception staff and physician assistant that I saw on the day of my visit.  The lack of covid-19 precautionary measures is alarming.  The waiting room is packed full of people (many coughing) waiting for covid testing (walk-in appointments). There should be some kind of wait in your car if you're there for covid testing available, entry through another door, make an appointment to be tested, etc, to limit the amount of contact between potentially infected patients and people who are there for things like a sprain or a bite wound. On top of that there was no cleaning of seats in the waiting room going on between patients.\nThey failed to ask for my pharmacy during the triage process, so when they told me I was ready to go, I asked where to pick up my meds as I noticed a pharmacy in the waiting room.  They told me my meds were ready to go at the pharmacy I was asked for in triage.  When I said there was no pharmacy asked for in triage, they asked me for my pharmacy, which then never sent my meds to.  They conveniently closed a few minutes after I left (I was in the waiting room for 2 hours).  When I called the next morning, I was on hold for 45 minutes constantly having my call transferred to the back staff who would never pick up only to be told they were too busy to deal with sending my call to the back again and that I could come to their pharmacy to get the prescriptions.  Which if they had told me that the night before I would have already had 2 doses of much needed medication.\nBasically this place is pure chaos.  I understand that things are hard with covid and healthcare workers are stretched thin, but this clinic is likely creating more cases by their poor planning and crowding of those exposed to covid with uninfected people.

I was in the office for my first visit this past week. While I was there I had an episode and was sent out by ambulance. I stayed in the hospital overnight for multiple test to be run. In 24 hours of being there I saw 5 different people from this practice. Every-time they came into my room it was clear that they had not communicated with one another. It was like starting all over again. I was literally discharged from the hospital without ever seeing the cardiologist for my results from an echocardiogram. I was told to follow up with my cardiologist on January 15th. I am still experiencing the same issues. I am contacting a completely different cardiologist today. The neurologist I saw came into my room and said that I clearly was having cardiac issues. Every hospitalists that I saw said the same thing.

You see, I came in Saturday for urgent care, and they told me is need to get a referral from my doctor in 72 hours, and my primary care doctor gave me a paper to bring to your front desk. I tried to take care of it over the phone, seeing as my PCP submitted the referral through the internet, but the front desk girl had \"no idea what to do here\" and kept putting me on hold to speak to someone named Erica. The first time was 20 minutes, then I hung up and called back, because this is something front desk ladies have been able to do at other medical offices. The second time, the front desk girl got snappy with me, explaining that there was a waiting room full of people waiting JUST for Erica. I explained to her that I'd had to receive COVID-19 testing this morning, and I didn't want to risk bringing the paper in, but this was a time sensitive issue, according to the paper this very office gave me. She told me I needed to stay home and wait on hold. I waited another 10 minutes on hold before I got in my car. I came in wearing a mask and explained to the front desk lady that I needed to give her the paper, which took all of like 20 seconds. I asked her if this could have been done over the phone, and she told me OF COURSE. I showed her where I was still on hold on my cell phone, making it over an hour on hold to get to Erica.
