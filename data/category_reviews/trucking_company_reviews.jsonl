They called me on Monday, no fault of the driver, to let me know that when it was loaded they didn't put it on a pallet and the driver had no way to unload it, he stated he had reached out to the terminal with no response. Since, he didnt' want to mess up my lawn mower, he asked me if I could call the reschedule the delivery. When I called, I got a gentleman who said well who forgot to put a pallet under it, sir idk, I don't work for you guys. He said you don't have a man at home that can just take it off off the truck, I said no sir, don't know any man strong enough to unload a  zero turn lawn mower in a crate by himself. He goes and you don't have a fork lift, again no sir, don't have one of those lying around either. He goes well guess I don't have a choice but to bring it back in and put a pallet under it, this is just rediculous. I am sorry to be a bother, but it is now day two of it suppose to be delivered and I still have no lawn mower and no contact from this company. I had to pay freight and they wanted me to do the work to unload their mistake. I called the company and was advised that my lawn mower was sitting waiting to be re loaded, but they couldn't tell me when this might happen or when it would be delivered. I don't want a phone call from this company to just give me more excuses or ask me if I could that fork lift or hulk of a man to do their job. I just want my lawn mower and then I will make sure to NOT ever have to deal with this company again.

We have had not one, but TWO horrible experiences with this tow service. The first time, they left my 70 year old Father stranded in 90\u00b0 weather for hours on end, we have AAA and they assigned Hank's to the tow job. They accepted the job and didn't call/notify/cancel the job to give my Dad the opportunity to get another company assigned to the job, they just left him stranded!!! Then, my husband called them last night and they accepted his request for a tow directly,no AAA,  he called them himself since they were close. They told him they would be there in no more than 45 minutes. 1 hour later, no word. He calls them back, they say they took another job and would get him as soon as they finished. 3 HOURS LATER, my husband is still stranded and calls them for the third time. They end up telling him he may be better off calling another company. God forbid what would have happened or how long my husband would have waited if leaving it up to them to follow up on a service they accepted to begin with. Y'all are clearly in the wrong business, and people can be seriously hurt or have personal things in their life that an be SEVERELY affected by your negligence and lack of consideration. Thank God they weren't on their way to work or something pressing that required a timely arrival. Lesson learned. I will be sure to let AAA know to never assign this business to my tow jobs again, and I would recommend the same to all of you, unless you want yourself and loved one's to be stuck out in the middle of the night with no help or in the blistering Alabama heat.

That does me no good.\nHowever, once confirmed, the movers were professional and on time, and their estimate for my move was spot on. They were also very fast and efficient. The only down side to the actual move was that they did not wrap the furniture before items were placed on the dolly.

Make a long story short I was there for a total of 6 hrs loaded secured and unloaded twice . My dispatcher had previously let them know my fee for the reload was 100 dollars. My fee for the extra weight was 100 dollars as well as my fee for detention was 50 dollars per hour for anything after being detained 2 hours. They agreed. After everything was said and done they only told me I would receive 100 dollars extra on my rate. I threatened to take load back and was awarded a total of three hundred dollars extra which is still 100 less than we agreed upon. I will never do business with this company again.

I asked if there was any way they could deliver it Thursday because it is food for my Kennel.\nShe explained they couldn't and would deliver it to me the next day, Friday. She said that I had to be here to receive the freight. So I made arrangements and waited. I got a call that afternoon telling me she didn't know what happened that my freight didn't make it on the truck, would it be ok if they delivered it Monday. I stated again that this was food for animals and really needed it. She said she was sorry and would it be ok if it was delivered Monday. I stated that I guess I really didn't have a choice did I. She said not really.\nSo today (Monday) I waited and had not heard from them. So at 2:34 I called asking if it would be delivered. The woman told me it was on the truck and that the driver was at Lowe's down by be and that I was the next stop.\nAn hour and a half later I called back asking what was going on. She said that the driver isn't good about returning calls and that he had some other stops that he was doing before me.\nAt 5:02 I called and a different lady acting flabbergasted that I didn't get my order yet. She said she would call the driver but he was the worst at calling them back (sounds like they need new drivers in my opinion).\nI told her that I have repeatedly stressed how important this delivery was and that I didn't understand what the problem was. She apologized and said she didn't know.\nI then told her that if the delivery wasn't here today that they could send it back to the company and explain to them why it wasn't delivered, that they had already wasted two days of my time and they wouldn't waste another. She said she understood that she would be upset too.\nI've received no calls from a manager or person trying to make this right. The driver never showed with my freight. This company acts like their customers don't matter. It is now 7:38 and obvious they aren't showing.\nSo.... use them at your own risk.

This is the single best employer I've ever worked for.  I honestly believe that I will retire from here.  This is a truly family company who cares about their drivers as long as you are safe and get your runs done in a timely manner.  Dash cameras face forward only, and don't record sound.  We just had an incident recently where a aggressive and dangerous driver cut off one of our trucks and brake checked our driver, causing an accident. The camera saved our driver and company from false and tax money wasting court time by fly by night lawyers.\n\nNo Transportation company is perfect, as the trade has gone far downhill due to government overregulation and overreach, and the ELD's shortening our work days, and the widespread unprofessionalism of super truckers and undertrained steering wheel holders. But, Wright is as good of a general carrier with dry vans that I have ever heard of.

Complete waste of time and money for me...  They changed the shipment to the next Tuesday(2/16).  I arranged to receive it Tuesday, but then they called Monday(2/15) to tell me it was delayed again.  At that point I simply asked if there was anyway to get it to the site Tuesday because I will have a crew there waiting for it, the customer service \"lady\" chuckled and asked how my crew was going to drive on ice....?  They are staying at hotel nearby, so they'd probably drive....?   I'd never recommend UPS Freight to anyone after this.. I can understand weather delays...but the tone to which I was being spoken to was completely unnecessary and honestly offensive.  She even spoke off the phone during the call to people in the warehouse asking \"Any of you working tomorrow?\"  Seriously?  Is this UPS or Jimbo's Hauling Service?

Finally, a supervisor called back told me they driver was AWOL, the guy John who I was dealing with was fired and now they have to find a new driver,  like that was my fault. Took them days to get back to me after I spoke to another supervisor who said she would call back and guess what\u2026 no call back. Finally, they said the had a new driver and it would cost $1400 with $150 already paid so I would have to pay the driver $1250. After my son already signed a contract for $850. When I asked for a discount for my trouble and extra cost to rent my rental car for another week they told me no. I do not know how this company has such a high rating with the BBB when they obviously extorted $400 dollars from me to get my car to Trenton TX and another $700 for the extra week of my car rental.

I ordered on March 21st and since March 25th the system stated that it was shipped. When I contacted the seller, I was informed to contact Estes since that's the carrier. Estes stated that the shipment is still on its way to the Birmingham site. My package arrived at this site at 6A.M. on April 6th. The seller already informed me that I have to schedule a delivery with this location once mynitems has arrived. Since April 6th through April 8th, I was informed by the receptionist that my package is still on their truck and it wont get delivered the date it was supposed to arrive which was April 8th. I was informed that they use a 3rd party to deliver to residential. So the Birmingham site was negligent to time sensitive items. I was informed that I would receive my items a week later. Mind you, this site is only 25 minutes away from my home. I was advised by the receptionist that I can come to their site to pick up my package. That would require me to get a Uhaul, pay that out of my pocket and get someone to unload the Uhaul. Which I find this to be unprofessional and unjust. Luckily, the seller understood what being reliable means and provided me the fundings to get a Uhaul to get my shipment from this site. Going forward, if I ever order anything from any site and it requires Birmingham Estes to deliver it to me then I will cancel and order from somewhere else.
