I would not recommend Promenade for any bridal services, especially bridesmaids dresses. I ordered dresses for my three bridesmaids about 5 months prior to my wedding. The manufacturer estimated a ship date about 6 weeks prior to my wedding. To make a long story short, the dresses never came in.\n\nFor more details, read below, but the bottom line is that I would take my business elsewhere in the future, and I recommend that others do the same. The consultants in the store were very nice and helpful, but it's not worth the headache of dealing with Promenade's lack of good communication skills. I guess they missed the lesson in business school that the customer is always right.\n\nWhen the dresses did not arrive in time for my wedding, they did offer us dresses from another source that were in stock. However, the sizes that my bridesmaids needed were not available. All three of my bridesmaids lived out of town, so having Promenade alter a larger dress down a size was not a feasible option for me, even though the store suggested altering dresses THEN shipping to the bridesmaids. I felt that anyone who knows anything would realize this option was crazy on a timeline of 10 days before the wedding. What were we going to do if the dresses were altered, shipped, and arrived 5 days before the wedding, and still didn't fit?\n\nSo about 10 days before my wedding, I ordered replacement dresses from David's Bridal and paid for overnight shipping. I'll admit that the fact that the original dresses never came in may have been the dress manufacturer's fault, but Promenade did not handle the situation well. The owner did not return phone calls when my mother or I would leave messages at the store, and she did not check the status of the supposed shipment as early or as often as I would have liked.\n\nI requested that the store reimburse me for the cost of the replacement dresses that the girls did not want or even like, but they refused. I sent an email to the owner with the invoices for these dresses, and never heard another word about it until I sent another email, waited 10 days, received no response, and then called the store to follow up.\n\nI don't want to sound like another jaded bride, but the truth is that there are plenty of other local businesses that do a better job of communicating with their customers and valuing customer satisfaction.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d45f35aef892b:0xb0bea7f33837c8f2"}

They cleaned my gold wedding rings and checked the prongs, on the spot, and didn't charge. My husband had lost some weight and wanted his wedding ring re-sized. Becky suggested he wait and see if he lost more weight before he got it re-sized. That was much appreciated as it told us they weren't out to just get our money.  Becky, Mary and Duke deserve a free lunch!! Everyone who works at Manning Jewelry are very polite, professional and friendly. I highly recommend Manning Jewelry to everyone.

My first encounter with these fine folks was just  to get my favorite Fossil watch repaired a year or so ago. I have had a sorted history with this watch over the years with other jewelers in TN who have gouged me and taken upwards of six months to complete a job so now that I am a local here I wasn't sure what to expect from my local jeweler. Well these guys did a quick turnaround at a very reasonable price and not only replaced the stem but my  watch was so clean and polished that I did a double take because, at first, I thought they had given me a brand new watch by mistake. Nope, it is my watch and I could not have been happier.\n\nNow as for the business, they have a wonderful selection of what you expect. Rings, watches, bracelets, earrings, etc. but they also have beautiful local artist pieces that are absolute stunning from inexpensive ocean themed pieces to a gorgeous diamond piece we just saw that range in prices into the thousands. They also buy gold and make custom pieces of your own design right in house.\n\nWe're here to yesterday to get my watch band repaired and they did it in minutes at no charge! That brings me to just how friendly, professional and all around terrific that everyone here, that I've encountered, are. I couldn't have asked to find a nicer group of folks in my new local jewelery store and I can assure that this a great place that I highly  recommend and that I will do all my jewelry business from now on!\n\nBottom line: they're great!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598368836697, "text": "Thank you so much!

She lives in the condo complex where we were renting for the week. So I asked her if she could recommend a nice place to eat and if she knew of a good jeweler. She right away told us of some places to eat, then she called her jeweler friend Glenn Manning and got me an appt with him. She told me that Manning Jewelers\u2019s has been in business for over 70 yrs. and how awesome everyone there is. And she was so right about that. And she showed me her beautiful ring that Glenn made for her.\nGlenn took my old wedding and turned it into the most beautiful wedding ring I\u2019ve ever seen. My husband and I were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary in Gulf Shores. Because our trip to St Lucia was canceled due to Covid! And we had been planning to make some changes with my ring anyway, so this was the best time for us to do that. I believe God puts people in our life path for a reason. So meeting Pepper, then meeting Glenn was a huge blessing for us.\nMy husband was very impressed how Glenn designed my ring on his computer then made a resin ring to hold my stones so I could see how it would look and feel on my finger. I wanted to use my existing center stone as a side stone to represent our past 35 yrs of marriage, then added a new larger center stone for the present, and another side stone to match for the future. Then we decided to add a two sided ring guard using my existing ring guard diamonds. So not only did Glenn design a beautiful ring for me, he also saved us a lot of money. And he recommended a great company to insure my new ring with, which had a better price than our home owners insurance co.\nI was very nervous about having my new ring shipped to me once it was done, just a few short weeks later, but Glenn put my mind at ease letting me know it will be insured and it came over night at my convenience. The whole process was Awesome! As well as the entire staff at Manning Jewelers. So if your heading to Gulf Shores, Al, or just looking for an Amazing  jeweler in that area, be sure to look up Manning Jewelers in Foley, Al. They are worth the drive from anywhere.\nWe also bought a really nice \u201cflip flop\u201d neck less for our daughter while we were in Manning\u2019s  and she loves it. Plus Manning Jewelers\u2019s also has a beautiful pendant called Stray Love that Glenn designed himself and he donates 20% of each sale to their foundation to help save stray animals. Best company to work with for all your jewelry needs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598110336782, "text": "Wow! Thank you Dena!

My daughter tried on several gowns and the salesgirl held the train on each dress as I took a photo of my daughter in it - never one time did she ever ask us not to take photos of the gowns. After my daughter had tried on about 4-5 dresses, one of the other salesgirls commented \"we don't really like for y'all to take photos of the tags\", to which I said I was sorry and we stopped taking photos of the tags on the gowns. I was unsure why, but I assume it is because their gowns are marked up well over retail. After my daughter tried on 1-2 more gowns, an older lady walked over to us and very rudely yelled at my daughter if she was taking pictures she would have to delete all of them before leaving the store. She also said \"I know two of my girls have already told you to stop taking pictures\". This is untrue, as the only person who had previously said anything was the salesgirl (not ours) that said not to take photos of the tags. I could see my daughter was very visibly upset, so we said thank you and left the store. They lost my business forever, as well as everyone I know that I can tell about our experience.

The girls got me right back. Shelby was my stylist & she was awesome. I told her exactly what I wanted; which was a dress with sleeves.  I showed her pictures from online & she found all the dresses. I'm a plus size bride so I was scared; I wouldn't have a lot of selections. I was very wrong; they had dresses in stock for any size bride. Shelby found me three great dresses. There was a dress online that had short sleeves. Shelby let me try on the same dress in strapless & told me she could order it for me with sleeves. Shelby explained payment arrangements & credit options to pay for the dress. Shelby broke everything down in detail for me. Which was very helpful for a new bride with a budget. I was very close to ordering that dress. But, I really wanted to try it on with the sleeves. I was so impressed with David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa; I made an appointment the same day at the David's Bridal in Hoover. I was thinking Hoover would have more dresses with sleeves & possibly have that dress with sleeves to try on. That was the worst idea ever. The store in Hoover is a huge disappointment for David's Bridal. The customer service needs to be reviewed at the Hoover store. The employees at that store are very unprofessional. After the bad experience at the Hoover store; I started reading reviews & asking friends. Apparently that is common for the David's Bridal in Hoover. If I decide to order through David's Bridal, it will definitely be with the Tuscaloosa David's Bridal. Great job David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8363211ca3b:0xc839cac2cd80b238"}

This made things much simpler and smooth on our planning end. The moment we walked into our reception hall, both of us were in complete shock of how beautiful things were. My husband and I did absolutely nothing at our wedding reception, other than to enjoy the moment and actually get the chance to mingle with our friends and family.

Corrie did a fantastic job, and took this event under her arms as a true professional that she is in this line of career.

I called 6 times trying to get the salesperson to give me an ETA. This proved to be around 4pm. The event started at 5pm. They sent one guy with part of my order. Because there was only 1 guy- my children unloaded and set up the tables with the table cloths- 18 to be exact! This guy only had the railing for the 2 tents. About 30 minutes later- another guy showed up with a helper. They had to find a faucet to load the water barrels to hold the tents down....After all of this... they had NONE of my CHAIRS!
