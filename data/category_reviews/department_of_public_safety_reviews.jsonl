Went to the Michael Blvd location yesterday during lunch time and was immediately called for my ticket- but they don't do the star ID there. She told me to be at this location at 7am on Wednesday because that's the best time. Waited outside for the doors to open at 7, still took 30 minutes. Girl in line behind me was also there for her Star, so she didn't get called till I left 30 minutes later. They should have more than one person doing Star ID, if this is so important.
