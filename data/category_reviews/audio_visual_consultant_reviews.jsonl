I was told that this info came directly from the TSI owners. They also said my doorbell video and other automations (lights, etc.) will not work if I canceled with them. They say that no other company will be able to use the equipment and it will only work with TSI since it was \"theirs\". They say that you cannot buy the Qolsys IQ Panel 2 online, because it comes from their dealer. This is all false.\n\nThey will also tell you that they don't know if they are allowed to cancel your account and that they don't know how to cancel accounts (and you have to call alarm.com to cancel). After multiple times calling alarm.com, I found out that you do in fact cancel with the dealer (TSI), not with them (they are just a third party software company). The lady at TSI needed to speak to her supervisor (but they were conveniently gone for the day), and she would call me first thing in the morning about if they can cancel/how to cancel my account (wouldn't you know, they never called back, I had to call them). The next morning, my call was passed around to 3 individuals until I spoke to somebody who wanted to make sure I 100% wanted to cancel my account (for all the reasons above). My alarm.com account was gone less than 5 minutes after I hung up. It was a fun few days of conversations.\n\nEdit: Thanks for responding M. Moore. I WAS a customer of yours, so I CAN leave a review on your company (I went to a different company because TSI is dishonest). Everything I've posted is 100% truth. You need to check your employees training if what you've read above is not how you want them interacting with customers.

The cellular device that is built into the Qolsys panel is registered to our company, TSI. You would need another company to replace that device. Of course the Qolsys panel is available online to anyone that would want to purchase it at a retail price. All the other automation devices that were installed in the home are also universal and can be used with any other company. You were not told that. That was your misunderstanding. You were actually told that the automation devices would no longer be free because TSI would no longer be providing that service. That is an agreement between TSI, DR Horton & the Alarm.com builder program. You can\u2019t just have some random company give you a free Alarm.com account. I would think this would clear up any confusion you have. Like I said it\u2019s very simple. You would need another company to replace the device.\n\nAlso please do not reach out to TSI to assist or help you for any other reason. We take our reputation and reviews very serious. We also do not appreciate you, who is not a customer going online as you if you are and giving our company a 1 star review. You are not a customer & do not reserve that right.
