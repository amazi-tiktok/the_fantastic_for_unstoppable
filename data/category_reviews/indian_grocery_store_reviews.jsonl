At the beginning of diwali sale there were no limitations on buying items. So I went again to buy some stuff for family members and owner had limited number of tea bags we could buy. Apparently this rule was only for us because the person who was right in front of us in the check out line had bought a full box of tea box and owners happily gave it to them. And when we tried to buy it owner said there is a limit to buy the same thing that a previous customer bought in bulk right in front me. Owner's vague reason was as\" he limited the quantity so everyone could have little.\" Very unreasonable! I told the owner we will never shop at their store again! He said \"OKAY\" !  I also said we went to buy some other items at Patel Brothers in Nashville where we bought few additional items that were not in sale at India Bazar. So owner asked \"why did you even had to Patel Brothers in Nashville??\" I don't even think he should even be asking this question to his customer. So I am definably not going to shop at this store again in my life.  I will definably not recommend this store to anyone. Prices at Patel Brothers are very reasonable and atleast they respect their customers. This owner has no respect for his customers. I would not even go to this store even if he now sells at cheap price; doesn't deserve my time or business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571603042077, "text": "We are sorry for the inconvenience you experienced during the visit! The purpose of the limit on the tea bags was strictly due to the supply shortage. This is our second week of the sale and our tea inventory is dropping due to a plethora of customers purchasing many tea bags. We indeed did not have the limit of 5 policy  in place during the start of our sale. However, as the days progressed, we noticed that the supply of tea is dropping at a rate we did not expect and we were unable to order more tea bags in a short period of time. So, we put a temporary strict limit on the amount of tea bags a customer can purchase until we get our delivery. In other words, we temporarily stopped giving customers more than 5tea bags. If you wish, you may purchase an entire box of tea once we get our delivery!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b2b10daf5d5:0x3cf24d085fda936c"}

My happiness was short lived because things are as overpriced at Indian Bazaar as neighboring Suraj imports. So it is still worthwhile to buy Indian grocery at Patel Brothers in Nashville TN.\n\nIf a particular item is in demand, the shopkeeper will jack up the price as if there is no tomorrow. I will give an example.  Fresh guava would cost $1.99 a pound when the shop opened 3 - 4 months ago. Seeing the demand for guava,  the price gradually went up and now the fruiit is now sold for $3, 99 a pound.  This is how the guy runs the business.
