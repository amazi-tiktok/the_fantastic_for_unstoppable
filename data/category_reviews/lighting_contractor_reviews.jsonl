This story takes place in the relatively small parking lot of the hotel I am staying in.\n\nBefore we get started though, know that I tried to resolve this issue directly with the company. The responses I received from them began with a man named \"Andrew\" responding to my initial email with \"who the heck is this\".\n\nIn the attached pictures you will see what their workers did. Things the company clearly considers acceptable, because their attitude towards the situation was condescending at best.\n\nThing #1: You'll see 3 trailers here. One is a different company, one is Scott's Services (the middle one) and one is unmarked. It's not easy to see how many spots they are taking up, but at least 6.\n\nThe drivers were there, and were aware of the problems they were causing. People were actively driving around the lot trying to find parking spots. You can also see the company name on the truck here.\n\nThere is another truck here that is apparently also theirs. After the front desk agent of the hotel asked them to stop blocking parking spaces, they refused, claiming they were stuck. After the agent left they had a good laugh about it, and then moved into the unmarked truck.\n\nThing #2: This is the other side of the parking lot. Another of their vehicles. A much smaller vehicle. One capable of fitting into a single space, and yet they managed to take up two with this one as well. Surely this truck was not stuck as well. What stopped them from fixing this one and freeing up a space?\n\nUpon reporting this behavior to the company, I was told by the person named Andrew that I had a personal problem, and that the hotel should deal with the issue if they feel they need to. I should also stop trying to get hard working people in trouble just because I cannot park where I want. Because everyone knows only Scott's Services' workers are hard working - none of the other patrons of the hotel they inconvenienced were hard working people as well.\n\nIn the adult world we do not get \"in trouble\"; We get held accountable for our actions. The company's refusal to hold their employees accountable for their behavior is a clear declaration that the behavior is condoned by the company, and that these actions accurately reflect the values of Scott's Services.\n\nConsider these things when you consider working with them. This is how they might choose to behave.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNotWXTHDswMaStIri7oO1KYTHcdDg-iMZM7EcH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIccL5azPhSQVorayMuH0fSQ-MeP3tLWdwfrfu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYlAUxH76tGUHIMWgqp0OIhoIpA1rtx96Fa9j5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890d91da79e17f:0xb7995bed26179105"}
