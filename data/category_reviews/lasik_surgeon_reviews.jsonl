When I was finally taken back I had to wait again because none of my info had been entered from the paperwork I brought when I arrived early.

I finally asked at one point how much longer it would be before I saw the Dr since I had to go back to work. She said it wouldn't be long and she would check on me in 5 minutes after she sent me back to the bright and packed waiting room with no eye protection after dilating my eyes.  About 30 minutes passed and she finally takes me back to another room. I ask again how long it will be because I HAVE to go back to work. She didn't like that but told me he would be in soon. He finally comes in the room and is in there less than 5 minutes to tell me I'm a candidate for lasik. I was also told that I would have to travel to their Columbus office for the surgery because the operating room there wasn't finished.\nMy wait was never acknowledged so of course I never received an apology for the 2 hours it took for a simple consultation.

We were forwarded here by our pediatrician and i called a month and a half ahead to make our appointment. Our appointment was scheduled for 3:15pm and I showed up at 2:45pm to complete all of the neccessary paperwork. My husband and two kids, 3years and 10months showed up at 3:15. We waited and waited and waited. We were not seen until 4:30 (now mind you their office closes at 5pm). However I constantly see the doctor and her nurses talking and giggling at a computer in the hallway. So after finally being called in the nurse does some little eye tests and dialates my sons eyes. While waiting i spoke with another mother that said her duaghter was there for her appointment at that was at 4pm. We are then sent out to the waiting room and wait another 20min for them to pull us into the room to see the Doctor. So after being called into the room we again waited and waited and waited. We sait in there for 45MIN!!!! Now it is 5:45pm and my two children are hungry, tired and are frustrated at having to look at walls. So we finally looked out of the room to find out that the ENTIRE Office Staff had left and the doctor was in another room with the little girl whose appointment was at 4pm which was after my son's. When the Doctor FINALLY made her appearance she said my son was fine and we could go!!! 3 HOURS to tell us he was fine! Now mind you on the paper work they sent it said to prepare for a 30min appointment! This was by far the WORST experience we have EVER had and will NEVER return!

Due to his deadbeat dad not paying child support, the child is on Medicaid, and Schaeffer is supposedly one of only two places in Huntsville that offers eye glasses under Medicaid. The little boy was actually excited about getting glasses - about being able to see the board in his 2nd grade classroom. He was excited by all the cool frames he saw on display. When it was his turn to be seen, he and his mother were ushered to a small table, tucked away from the waiting area, with 3 red boxes sitting on top. In those boxes were dirty frames, with only a few sized for boys and not even a mirror to see one's reflection while trying on. The mother humbly asked a clerk if there were any other options for her son and was told \"what you see is what you get\" then dismissed as if her presence were a nuisance. The little boy was forced to pick out a pair of glasses that, although he needs, we're relatively certain he won't wear past the 2nd day he owns them due to the harassment he'll receive from bullies in school. So he won't be able to see the board, and his education and self esteem will suffer. His mother was understandably upset, but what can she do? She already works at least 3 jobs to pay for food and bills. Life can be hard. You do the best you can with what you have.\n\nBut did this mother and child have to be treated like dirt? No. Absolutely not. The behavior of Schaeffer's employee was abhorrent, at best.\n\nI, personally, have a great job with good insurance and can afford not only new glasses every two years, but new prescription sunglasses as well. Where do I go for my glasses? The WalMart vision center on University Drive. The doctor and staff there treat everyone equally well, no matter how they're dressed, how much they make, or what their insurance status is. I know other high-income families that prefer to go there as well.\n\nI will personally spread this story as far and wide as I can.

I am very disappointed in my \"very short\" visit with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff. (Well I didn't even meet Dr. Rosenstiel???!) Being that I live in Montgomery, I have to request a day off for ALL my eye appointment visits.  I am not new to UAB Callahan Eye Hospital as I've had multiple surgeries within the last three years there. As a matter of fact I just had an appointment there two weeks ago with the incredible Dr. Priscilla Fowler and staff.   I've been diagnosed with Kerataconus and Dr. Priscilla Fowler is my primary eye doctor.  Dr. Fowler and staff are some of the nicest people I've met in the eye care industry. Earlier this year and this past month I received the Cross-Linking  procedure.  I spent over $6000 within the last three years at Callahan eye.  Dr. Fowler and staff treat me with respect on EVERY visit,  yet on December 10 with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff I felt the lesser of.  This visit was scheduled to replace my old sclera lenses with new.  You would think before my arrival they would've did their research on my condition.  Upon my arrival in the room, Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse asked if I ever had sclera lenses?? (I'VE HAD SCLERA CONTACTS FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS??) From there, he goes straight into and I quote, \"before we even see you, you have to pay X amount of dollars!?. Furthermore, he adds, \"The Lenses will be an additional $XXXX.XX amount of dollars to get them?   Now at this point I was feeling as though they did not want to help me as Dr. Fowler and staff did you for the last couple of years.?  Now do mind you I've already spent thousands of dollars to get my eyes corrected.  The money is not an option, but I felt inferior to his demands.  I also wondered have they even looked in my charts from previous visits.? \"Have they even checked my insurance\" I thought to myself?  At that point I asked him a series of questions in terms of verifying my insurances and deductibles. To no avail he says nothing will be covered. Now as I mentioned money would not be a concern as I've spent a lot of money to fix my Eye disease. ( As well as the removal of an tumor in my eyelid two years prior ).  More questions came to mind in this parlay with Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse.  At this point I felt that the nurse is trying to rush me so he leaves then comes back with a business card and prices on it. He then states, \" if you have any questions please call Melissa\" on the business card. I agreed and proceeded to leave. Upon leaving, I felt very embarrassed to even be there. I rushed out and got in my car. I kept thinking to myself \"have they even check my insurance\". So I called my wife, and she confirmed we do have Eye insurance.  I decided I needed to call them back to confirm and verify with them that I have insurance, the same insurance I've used last three years. Two calls later and one left message, I still have not heard from Melissa, Dr. Rosenstiel , or the male nurse that was talking to me. I never even got to meet Dr. Rosenstiel??? I will still come up to visit Dr. Fowler but I will do my business elsewhere in finding new Sclera lenses!\nVery disappointing!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bea1d7b458b:0x2741eb9855e3054"}

I began my LASIK search with another eye care provider. It did not occur to me that I would be rejected as a candidate, until the optometrist (not surgeon) noted a callus due to chronic contact use and subsequently rejected me. Thankfully my husband suggested Michelson where the doctor that would be performing surgery approved me. Dr. Michelson\u2019s years of experience and expertise allowed him to see the callus was not a structural part of my eye and would not prohibit my benefiting from LASIK. Having a one on one with Dr. Michelson prior to the day of surgery was invaluable for me. The staff was very attentive and I felt as though I was in the care of a very competent work family. I felt informed and reassured throughout the process including during the surgery itself. No more foggy glasses, no more keeping a contact schedule or burning scratchy contacts.

I could kick myself for not having lasik done sooner! I am 51 years old and as I have gotten older, I began having more trouble with wearing contacts.  I could only wear them for a few hours before they would cause my eyes to get very dry, red and irritated.  Because of this, I reverted back to wearing glasses which I really didn't want to have to do but felt like I had no choice.  I was near-sighted, which meant that I had no significant problems seeing up close, but couldn't see things very clearly at a distance. About 15 years earlier, a supervisor of mine had lasik and mentioned that he had done an extensive amount of research on it and would be having Dr. Michelson perform his surgery. I kept Dr. Michelson's name tucked away in my memory and said that if I ever had it done, he would be the one that would do it.  I made the call to Michelson Laser Vision and couldn't get over how easily it all fell together after that call.  I went to my first appoinment and had several super-quick tests to see if I could actually qualify for lasik.  Margaret and Lauren ran the tests, then Margaret sat down with me and  told me that I qualified for the procedure. They were both great about taking the time to explain the tests and what to expect on the day of the surgery.  I was so excited to hear this news because my eyesight was so bad in one eye and I also have a history of diabetes in my family which I thought would completely rule me out for the surgery. Dr. Michelson asked me if  his daughter,Jennifer Michelson, M.D., who is also a practicing opthalmologist/cataract and laser eye surgeon there at the clinic,could perform the lasik surgery under his supervision. She has done many, many of these surgeries  and is very well qualified just as her father. I agreed, came in a few days later and had the procedure done  which only took about one minute to perform and I was in the office for about an hour total.  There was absolutely no pain involved and I didn't have any trouble whatsoever after the surgery.  The next day I was seeing perfectly with 20/15 vision in my eye that had before not been able to make out huge letters on the eye chart! I was sold! I drove to my appointment that very morning after surgery and  was driving and taking kids to cross-country practice that day as well. To be able to see so clearly things like car tag numbers, street signs and other things at a distance without the use of any kind of corrective lenses was so incredible! If you have ever thought about having this procedure you won't regret it.  It is truly a life-changing experience!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891771d5bc1327:0xa9b2514c31329e4c"}

I always wanted to do lasik because contacts bothered my eyes and glasses provided no help with peripheral vision. I mentioned in passing to a family member that I was considering lasik and he referred me to Dr Michelson for a free consultation. I can honestly say from the first time I stepped into this practice that I genuinely felt that every employee cared about my concerns and my questions. Especially my lasik consultant Donna. Thanks Donna! I had lasik scheduled for 9:30 am. I arrived at 9:15 and within 5 minutes I was in the back getting started. After all of the final testing and surgery prep I was walked to the surgery suite and the procedure began. My wife recorded the entire surgery and from beginning to end was ten minutes. There was absolutely zero pain during any of it! It has now been 10 hours since the surgery and I can see better than ever before and I know it's only going to get better. I am amazed at how professional Dr. Michelson and his staff are. This has truly been a life changing experience. So thankful that I chose the best eye surgeon in the state to do my lasik. I wouldn't have trusted anyone else with my eyes! You guys are the best!\nUPDATE\nI had lasik on 8/25 and went in this morning 8/26 for post-op checkup. Before lasik I was legally blind. Now, less than 24 hours later my vision is 20/15 in both eyes! That is better than 20/20. I only wish I would have done it sooner!
