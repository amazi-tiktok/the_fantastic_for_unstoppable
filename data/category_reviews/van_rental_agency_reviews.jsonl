I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.  More should have been done to fix my issues instead of kicking the can down the road until they could say it was out of warranty.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197e84af1c55:0xf5fc42f4ad17911e"}

The first time when I moved to this area I dropped off my UHaul equipment here and a middle aged Army Veteran greeted me and helped with the process of the return. He also helped me to figure out the area and gave me some local information which was very helpful. Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge. His kindness, professionalism, and overall customer care is the entire reason UHaul still has my business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626d1442a93003:0x7d8a498adb157034"}

I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...   Finally, at the end of the transaction I thanked him and stretched out my hand and he refused to shake it. Mr. Hall has a chip on his shoulder that needs to be challenged. I remain unhappy with your service. In the past I have rented storage space for 6 months, rented vehicles to move but that business will go elsewhere. I will be needing storage again but another company that can do the job correctly, that doesn't have an attitude that they were doing me a favor by poor quality work...that other company will get my business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.  Plus you can get an additional 5% discount if you have a Home Depot credit card.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

Hours stated that they close at 4pm and I had called earlier to notify them that I was dropping the truck off that day and to verify that they had room for the dropoff of the big trunk. The app wouldn't locate the location of the uhaul place so we were unable to checkout through the app. We dropped the keys off in the 24 hour box and drove back to a northern state to finish packing up what didn't fit in the 26 foot. We got a 15 foot truck, loaded it up and returned back down south. I noticed that the 26 foot reservation did not close out online. I called and talked with guy over the phone. He said that he had closed it out, but I told him that it wasn't showing as closed out. They closed out the 26 foot uhaul on the last day of reservation at  the exact hour that it was due back. The store isn't even open that day.  I received a notification for tolls for the 26 uhaul yet I picked up a 15 foot uhaul the same day in Virginia. There is no way to be in two places at once. I mileage on both trucks should have been the same as they were driven to the same location.  The 26 foot uhaul had additional mileage on it from somewhere else, but because the date that the reservation was closed out on I had to pay for the tolls. The whole reason I made a big deal about constantly calling uhaul was because I needed a copy of the receipt so that I can get reimbursed for the move due to work. We will NEVER use uhaul again because of this and do not recommend them when businesses can't even be trusted to close out reservations when equipment is returned.

DO NOT BUY!\nWe purchased a shed 3 yrs ago. You can even call the business directly and their hold messages promise top quality craftsmenship. We told them the day we bought it that we were purchasing this to pay floor, put walls, heating and air, and create an apartment type space for my son. We were reassured and \u201csold\u201d on the quality promised and the guarantee of it they stood by with their warranty. Since buying the building for $10,000 cash 3 yrs ago, we have had two leaking doors everytime it rains for 3 straight yrs. we have utilized the warranty each time. After the 4th or 5th time of having them try and fix it (we were promised a FIX not an attempt at a fix) we said we wanted our money back. We cannot lay floor over wet floor to be ruined. The entire operation has been halted for three whole YEARS waiting on this promised fixed. We were told to give them one more chance by completely replacing the inward swinging doors with outward swinging doors. If they did not fix it, they promised they would discuss with me a possible refund or partial refund. Even a 50% refund would allow us to have a porch made. At this point however, a 50% refund keeps me connected to a crooked company. They replaced the doors and the next rain came and it was still leaking. We took pictures each time of course. So I called in about the promised conversation about a refund. I was transferred to a lady who took my number and would call me back, and I never heard from her. In the mean time they were sending out (same repair man each time) the repair man to \u201cfix\u201d it for the 5th ish time. So he did, well I just went out there and it\u2019s a soggy soaking wet mess again. This will be the SECOND time since what they called their \u201clast resort\u201d by replacing the doors. They basically told me if that didn\u2019t fix it nothing would. So I have a 10,000 box in my yard. Even the mattresses we placed out there are now ruined from the leaking doors and had to be thrown away. I\u2019m unable to use it. I called again today and they wanted to come \u201cfix\u201d it even tho they told me they had done everything they can. These floors in my opinion need to be replaced now by the doors if they\u2019re going to keep it leaking. I didn\u2019t pay for floors exposed to rain for 3 solid yrs. I asked again anout a refund and was told because the building is as old as it is, they can\u2019t do anything about it. Well, it\u2019s only as old as it is because they kept telling me they\u2019d fix it. I\u2019ve been kind and patient for 3 YRS! If they can\u2019t stand by their written warranty statement to fix and REPAIR (not bandaid) the issue of THEIR building THEY built, the I deserve a refund! When you buy a car and the engine blows each time it\u2019s replaced, you get another car under a warranty or a refund. It\u2019s called a lemon at some point.

It was a good thing I called the morning of my reservation to make sure they had the car I needed because they did not. I was to pick up a full size SUV at noon and by 3 pm I still did not have a car. Was told they had to go to another location to pick up a mini van because that was the only thing available. After I was told I could pick the car up at 2:30, putting me behind my schedule by 2 and a half hours already, I arrived at this location and was told that whoever went to pick up the car must have gotten lost on the way back because he was not back yet. Was asked to wait in the lobby which smelt like pure gasoline, and they would come get me as soon as he arrived. 30 minutes later still no one has come to get me and I walk back to the desk and ask if he has an update and he said No, that he might be out back. I then asked if he could check because I was 3 hours behind schedule already and still had a 4 hour drive ahead of me. He then ran to the \"Back\" and another guy, I'm assuming the person who got lost on the way back to the lot, came in about 10 minutes later and apologized and started the paperwork. The van was comfortable but not what I had requested a month in advance. And just FYI, I was also told by customer service that making a reservation does not guarantee you will get the vehicle you requested, just before she said she was transferring me and disconnected the line.\nThe day I was set to return the car, I received a phone call from someone at that location and was asked if I could return the vehicle earlier than requested because they had someone that needed that particular car and didn't have another in their fleet. First of all I would not call what they have a \"fleet\" of vehicles, it's more like 3 cars evidently. And second, NO! You didn't go out of your way for me to find the vehicle I had requested a month in advance. I called your customer service line after waiting for your to call me back for 4 hours and had them change it to a van and see if any locations had it. Then I called you and told you I had it changed and where it was located. But this is not the first time this has happened at this location. I gave you a second chance and you will not get a third. I will not rent from this company as a whole again. Very poor customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533759624077, "text": "Jennifer Jenkins, we would like to look into this further.

I should have known that you were a disreputable business when Michael asked me for my credit card without quoting me a price. Since you are a monopoly I guess you think that people will pay any amount of money to rent a truck.\nHe then quoted me a price which I agreed to. I found out when I picked up the truck that he conveniently failed to tell me that there is a hidden fee of $0.99 a mile. WOW, now you have added $80 in hidden fees.\nI started to cancel the reservation but then I remembered that you are the only place that rents moving equipment. I had to move so I was stuck with the extortion.\nSince you are greedy bastards, you decide to go ahead and stick it to me. You double billed my credit card to make up for the frustration of dealing with an unhappy customer.\nRest assured that this isn't the end of the case.

It is climate controlled and therefore is always a nice escape from the terrible heat during the summer, as well as a guarantee that the items in your unit will never be exposed to unsuitable temperatures regardless of the outside weather. Additionally, they have implemented a motion detection system connected to their lights in an effort to conserve energy. When movement is detected, the lights for the specific area you are walking through illuminate. After a period of time during which the system detects no movement, the lights turn off and the building goes dark.

They asked for the review, so I am complying, but I'm being honest!\n\nWe reserved a FULL size vehicle - a little over a week ahead of time - for a trip we needed to make.\n\nImagine our surprise when the Assistant Manager, Travis, took us out to a Chrysler 200! (STANDARD SIZE vehicle, which rents for $4/day less than a FULL SIZE car.) We knew the car looked small and we asked him if it was a full size car to which he replied, \u201cYes, it is.\u201d Back inside the office, we noticed the Chrysler 200 was showing right on the counter top as a STANDARD SIZE car. We asked Travis about it and he stated, \u201cIt goes back and forth. It was just moved up to a FULL SIZE car when the new ones came out.\u201d Okay, we didn\u2019t question him further. Then, we went out to get in the vehicle and see if it would be comfortable enough for our trip. When my husband got in the car, he immediately popped back out and said it wreaked of cigarette smoke! I said, \u201cI can\u2019t ride in that then. I am allergic to cigarette smoke\u201d. My husband knew this and that is why he was letting me know. Travis was going inside to get his helper to spray the car and see if it would help. His helper said he had already sprayed inside it. It was horrible! Travis then asked us, \u201cWhat can I do to make this okay for you?\u201d We told him we needed a different car and he stated he didn\u2019t have anything else to offer us. We kept talking and we asked him, again, \u201cIs this REALLY considered a FULL SIZE car?\u201d He FINALLY admitted it was a STANDARD SIZE vehicle. He then offered to bring our cost down to the standard size pricing (how nice of him, since that is what we were getting!) and he also said he would do a 10% discount plus take $30 off. We truly had no choice but to accept his offer. I told him I wanted to get it in writing of just how much we were to be refunded, once the car was returned. He told me the total we would be refunded and he put it in writing.\n\nWell, we were hoping we could use some of our Young Living Essential Oils to get rid of the cigarette smell, but it did not work. This car had been smoked in for so long, the smell was already set in! My husband and I were both sick the whole time we were gone due to having to ride in that horrible smell! I can not believe someone can call and make a RESERVATION for a car and NOT get the type car they reserved! What is the point in making a reservation, if you are still just going to have to take whatever they have to offer you? This is NOT good business and I doubt we will ever use Enterprise again! In hindsight, we should have told Travis to get on the phone and call one of their locations to get us a FULL SIZE, SMOKE FREE car to the Brewton office immediately.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1465590550152, "text": "Thank you for your review, Kathryn.

Thank you, Bryan, for bringing pride back to the Brewton office, I have thoroughly enjoyed spreading the news that our Enterprise is back!!!!!!\nFirst, let me say this location was at one time top notch. Those days are gone!!!!!! After making a car reservation a week in advance, I get a call an hour before pickup today that I am the fifth in line to get a vehicle this afternoon. Well, the business day has ended and here I am without our rental and no call returned!!!! This is not the first for this type of occurrence at this store. I believe in second chances but this fourth chance has pushed me too far. Please, if you make a reservation, ask for your reservation number. I wasn't given my number this time and didn't think to ask for it. But, I obviously had a reservation in the system because the store called to let me know it would be ready later than 2:00. However, when I called customer service, they weren't showing I had a reservation!!!!

The vehicles are always so clean and you can tell they take great care of them. My problem is with the customer service. I can never get ahold of anyone there on the phone and they are never friendly when I go inside either. I put in a request over a month ago for a vehicle and no one ever called me. I called 3 times during this month of waiting, at different times of the day to make sure I wasn\u2019t calling when they were busy, and they would never answer. I finally went up there and was told that the online rental tool is not a good tool. I do not think they should have the tool as an option if no one will call you back. Again, we have had great experiences with Long Lewis rental, but the customer service and follow up is always lacking.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620316234116, "text": "Cheyenne- we are terribly sorry for the experience you have had.

I guess it\u2019s easy to take it out on Enterprise in a Google Maps review.

I drove it like the safe careful driver I am, filled up the tank, returned it to the location. As I sat in the waiting room, the man inspecting the car says: \"ma'am are you aware a hubcap is missing?\" Of course I'm not aware...because I didn't hit anything. He calls the Toyota Dealership and they quote him $75 to replace it. And I guess I, as a paying customer, am expected to just accept my bad luck, pay it as if I'm made of money, and not say a damn thing. To me, a hubcap should not just pop off with normal driving and, if it does, it's because Enterprise staff have not been seeing to it that the car doesn't have loose parts. When we did the original walk around inspection, I was led to believe that we were looking for physical damage to the car - no more, no less.\n\nManager said I have two options: pay the $75 or file it on insurance. I said there is nothing else that can be done? He said they could call around other places for other estimates but they have a \"special relationship\" and that's probably the best price they could get...so basically no. At that point I was like \"screw it\" and I said we're done with this conversation - and he stormed off. Because I guess that's what managers are supposed to do when a customer is upset. That's what I was...a customer...not a blithering idiot driver that rags out someone else's car because I have no respect for the property of others. I was a customer...but I'm not anymore.\n\nI would advise anyone else renting a car with them to get down in the dirt and make sure the hubcaps are on securely. I didn't do that, Enterprise sure as hell never did (and never will for their customers) and a bill that should have been $52.50 was $134.84.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526690950169, "text": "Ms. Ankersen, I would be happy to look into this for you.
