We have always had a wonderful experience but today not so much. Today my daughter and her friend decided we\u2019d do some shopping and eating while they had their \u201cbig girl\u201d lunch together I walked two stores down to dress up and decided I\u2019d look for her a cute dress while they had their time together to chat! Found the cutest two dresses and proceeded to the check to ask if I could leave them there for ten mins while I walk literally two stores down. I\u2019ve done this time and time before we always eat at the local restaurant connected to the strip mall. I was quickly told NO sorry we can\u2019t hold anything. I was a little shocked and explained she was two doors down and I wanted to make sure they were a good fit due to them being final sale. The two looked at each other and said sorry because you can go online 24 hours and order we aren\u2019t allowed to hold anything. Now if I\u2019d previously not held something before maybe I\u2019d believe them. One proceeded to say I\u2019ll put it in the fitting room and we can just say she\u2019s waiting on the fitting room!! Which means YOUR HOLDING IT. I smiled and told them that was ok and walked out needless to say I will only order from online or if I see the manager ( can\u2019t remeber her name but she\u2019s awesome) I\u2019ll only shop then. These two youngsters possible need a lesson on customer service!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb171d4f769:0xad3f59ee2c264cd2"}
