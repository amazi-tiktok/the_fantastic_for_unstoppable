They quoted me the price before even diagnosing the issue, stating, \"we can make this stop dripping for $175\". It was a 20 minute repair job and it did not solve the problem - still leaked. I requested them to come back because it wasn't fixed and all they did was the exact same repair. This did nothing, and the faucet still leaks to this day. The plumbers were not professional, did not wear masks, and did not want to take the time to accurately diagnose and fix the issue. Instead, they looked for the easiest and quickest \"fix\".  I ended up having to call another plumber who was able to correctly diagnose and explain the problem to me. I might as well have thrown $225 in the trash.\n\nNot only did the plumber waste my money, but cost me HUNDREDS. During my initial request for service, I also requested that they re-install a center knob on a shower spa sprayer that came loose. It was installed a few years ago, and nothing technically was wrong with it - the center knob just needed to be re-installed. After taking apart the cover plate and fooling with it, they said it couldn't be fixed. They never diagnosed the issue or told me what was wrong with it, offering no solution. I hired a different plumber to look at it today and he said that the metal lip on the center valve is chipped and broken from someone trying to turn it excessively to remove it (it is one piece and can't be removed). It was installed a few years ago, and no one else has fooled with it except for them. So, they chipped it when fooling with it, which explains their reluctance to fix the problem. Now the entire unit has to be replaced, I have to cut a hole in my wall, and it is going to cost me hundreds of dollars. An honest or reliable plumber would have owned up to the mistake instead of trying to brush it off, and a knowledgeable one would have known better to begin with.\n\nI honestly never leave bad reviews.

{"user_id": "106281876022532132920", "name": "Betty Pierce", "time": 1624154500227, "rating": 5.0, "text": "Some years ago we needed some significant waterproofing and structural repairs done in our basement home. We contacted a few different companies to provide an Inspection and estimate. After some discussion we decided\nOn a company that was not on the higher side of the estimates. We felt like the fix would be pretty much the same no matter who we chose\nAnd saving money was in our interest at the time..One company we called was a fairly well known local company A.F.S. We were familiar with them because they began here in Decatur\nSo we would see trucks around town. FYI,  I wanted you to know, we should\u2019ve called AFS from the start. Today I\u2019m here some 7 odd years later, after spending thousands of dollars with the low price alternative and my\nSump pump and drainage system doesn\u2019t work, our walls are blistering and cracking up, down and horizontally, water is seeping thru the wall cracks and the concrete blocks are shifting and cracking our exterior brick and interior block walls. I have limited mobility and couldn\u2019t go check on these things easily and things kept getting worse. Considering what we received from the lower priced company, we decided to call AFS to provide their opinion on our basement situation. At this point , the only thing working or effective was a dehumidifier. It was time to seek experts advice. We had previously used AFS in a limited capacity for our cracked pool deck and they performed that repair just fine and although that repair is not inexpensive,\nIt was much less and more quickly usable than any other options we looked at. So from there we felt we could allow them a chance to tell us (what )was happening and (why )was it happening . When the day came for the inspection, David Flamm , the inspector called our home in advance and let us know his arrival time and asked if we could sit for a few questions before beginning the inspection. He felt we would have something of value to help  determine the cause of the damage. We felt he was sincere and listened to what we had to say and even wrote down the answers. We watched as he went room to room with his big light and something like a laser . He was very thorough, and  took  pictures as he moved around the house.\nOne thing he did,  that most never do, is David removed his boots before walking on my clean floors. Not a big thing but it got my attention.\nAfter the inspection inside , he explained what he would be doing outside and that my husband\nWas welcome to tag along if he wanted, so he did. He was rather impressed with David\u2019s knowledge and ability to explain the plan of repair. After our experience with another company (who did almost nothing) and David\u2019s attitude and attention to our concerns, we were very relieved that we called AFS. He took pictures and put them on his laptop for us to clearly see the issues, he asked our opinion and waited for our response. Never did he act pushy or lacked any uncertainty about what he would do to help us. He allowed us to view video software of the repairs needed, and even priced the project as he went thru the videos. Needless to say,  we were very comfortable with Dave and could feel he really knew what the problems required. Before we had to ask, David explained AFS Warranty, Service and maintenance program and how they return and maintain the eguipment so we didn't have to worry. This was very helpful considering my physical limitations and my husband is very busy with work. We felt very reassured after spending a couple of hours with David Flamm, we had called the right company. AFS must invest a lot of time into the people that work for them, it was so smooth . We had no trouble connecting the dots. David explained the project review process they go they prior to arriving to our home and how the foreman on the job has already seen the project and all of the pictures as David and the foreman discuss the ins and outs of it. It seems every concern we had initially was addressed before we had to express it. AFS, should be the first and only call you make for your home today.\nWe are glad we did.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624291512896, "text": "Hello Betty!

They were very prompt and courteous.  We had a small problem that Nathan brought to my attention after he and his crew started the prep work in the area which resulted in them having to remove 2 additional (early 1930's) brick support columns and level the dirt foundation under them.  Had Nathan not brought the potential problem to my attention, even with the work they were doing, I might have had more collapse in that area in the future.  Now I won't have any concerns about that.  I was very impressed with how well these 3 men worked together and also independently while completing the job.  AFS has turned an old damp 1930's basement crawl space area into a bright, clean space my grandkids could play in at my house.  The crew cleanup in my yard was spot-on.  They even hauled off those brick columns for me.  I'm looking forward to the follow-up visit in about two months to see how much more lift they can get in my (had been) sagging floors.  There was some immediate improvement when they tightened all the floor jacks and after that new dehumidifier dries up my floor rafters for a few weeks we should see even more improvement.

It had to be stabilized or I was going to have to totally redo the carport.  I did not know who to contact but a friend had AFS do some foundation stabilization work for him. I asked him about AFS.  I had seen the TV ads but know that anyone can do a slick tv commercial.  It turns out, the friend was positively impressed with AFS on his project. So, I made an appointment for their rep to visit.  I was still a little skeptical.  The field rep arrived on time and looked at my issue.  He suggested their concrete stabilization product.  He described how it would work and be installed.  He was not at all pushy nor did he give me any slick sales pitch.  He knew about the product, how it was installed and what it could do.  I agreed to do the project with them and made a down payment on the project.  We scheduled the job and on the agreed upon day, the installation crew arrived.  They were a little later than initially planned BUT the office called to say they were running behind, so that was not an issue.  They were maybe 30 minutes later than planned. The installation guys checked over the carport and talked over their plans with me. Then they went straight to work. They were clean cut, totally nice people to have at my home with no smoking or foul language - just hard work! There was an obvious difference to the carport when they were through.  So, I really felt good about their work.  They also cleaned up any mess that they made (a little concrete dust) with the tools they brought to the job site. Prior to this experience, I did not know this company,  other than my from friends recommendation & a TV commercial.  After my experience I would not hesitate to recommend them.\nI give AFS an A+ & 5 stars!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601305643990, "text": "Mr. Counts, thank you for such a thorough review and recommendation!

Over the last 2 years, it has flooded during the heavy rains in January and February.  I did some research to evaluate this issue and decided to go with a reputable, established, and known company.  I was not disappointed.  Mr. David Flamm arrived at my house promptly for my initial appointment.  He was professional and personable.  After a few minutes of discussion, he understood my concerns and started his investigation.  Once he completed his investigation, he sat down my wife and I and went over his findings. His presentation of what could be done was easy to understand and follow along using the video clips on his computer. All seemed logical, but me, being the ever skeptic, asked many questions about how the system would work and why it seemed the water was infiltrating my living spaces after 7 years of no water. He answered all of my questions and his explanations made sense.  After it was all said and done, we had the Aquastop Control groundwater seepage system with Aquastop basement air system,  EZflow  tubing with the triple pump action installed.\nDay of installation:\nThe team showed up on time for the install lead by Nick.  It had been raining a lot AGAIN and i had my makeshift sump-pump system running to dewater the area where it was building up.  The team laid down plastic tarp so as to not get my finished basement dirty and commenced to working.  It took them 2 days to complete.  What a job. When they laid in the pump system and started the pumps, the water buildup that i had my makeshift system in for, drained and did not come back.  EUREKA!!  Since this system has been in place, we continue to get the storms and flooding but my basement/crawlspace remain dry.  The system works as described and projected.  I cannot thank Dave and his team from AFS enough.  Their professionalism and concern to provide a solution to my problem was genuine and their work is top of the line. Dave's evaluation of my needs and his concern to present me with different options was genuine and without company profit in mind. I highly recommend this company and team for any issues you may have in basement or crawlspace area.

Due to hydrostatic pressure my walls were caving in slightly. I don\u2019t remember the terminology  AFS uses but they came in and put what looks like a tarp over the walls.  It\u2019s to prevent moisture and mold buildup. Life time warranty. It might be working but since my walls are covered up I am only guessing it is. After I removed everything from the walls in the basement, yes, everything, including taking out my bathroom, they jackhammered around the edge of the walls about a one foot trench. AFS then put in place , what I call a gutter. Rocks were placed around this gutter along with a moisture barrier and then concrete poured on top. Supposedly, they put holes into each concrete block on my wall and place  a pipe that goes from block to gutter. As you know, these blocks have cylinders inside where water can build up. The purpose is for water to drain from block(my wall)into the gutter then it\u2019s to flow to corner of house where there is a sump pump.\n\nShort story is that it\u2019s been two years and no water has touched the sump pump. As you know the last two years have been like northwest Washington where we are getting tons of rain. Now I\u2019m having moisture, called efflorescence, coming up where they jackhammered. AFS came by several times and put a sealer on floor. Never worked. Had another man come by and look at system to see if water was flowing properly; it was.

We found this out after we notified them we had a quote from another company.  This should throw up major \u201cred flags\u201d to anyone reading this. Why not give you their best price up front? Now read the rest if you would like.\n\nStay away from AFS if you plan on getting multiple quotes.  I LOVED everything they told me and was completely impressed by their upfront professionalism.  The representative came out, did a thorough inspection and gave us a detailed layout of what needed to be done.  Where things went bad was when it was discovered that we also had another company come out, providing comparable services for a moderately better price.  As a decent human, I felt it important to contact the AFS rep to inform him of our appreciation but we were going to go with a competitor. At that point he became a high-pressured salesman and became somewhat belligerent.  To top things off, we had filed a coverable insurance claim regarding a busted drain pipe and the insurance company contacted this AFS rep and the rep told them the problem was due to an issue that is well-known not coverable by insurance.  Had I not called the rep to inform him, man-to-man, of our decision and simply \u201cghosted\u201d him (a cowardly way of handling things), we wouldn\u2019t be in the predicament.  Through this behavior and revengeful tactics, he reassured us that AFS is not the type of company we want to take care of our home.  My wife and I are teachers and work on a limited budget...we would be silly to not request more than one estimate for a job this size.  A company such as this should realize that.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578440362389, "text": "Mr. Milam,\n\nWe appreciate your kind remarks regarding the professionalism of our inspector.  We do try to be extremely detailed and responsible with both our inspections and repair plans.  Obviously we are disappointed when a homeowner chooses to use another company, but always want folks to make a decision that they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nIt sounds like there was some confusion regarding a possible insurance claim that you filed.  When asked by homeowners whether a crawlspace scenario is covered by insurance, our standard reply is that \u2018it depends on your policy, it\u2019s best to contract your insurance provider\u2019.  While we\u2019re not an insurance company, the trend that we have seen is that acute issues like a plumbing leak may be covered, whereas issues that develop over time, like ground water seepage are typically the homeowner\u2019s responsibility \u2013 similar to hail damage to a roof vs a roof just wearing out.\n\nThe inspection photos of your crawl space showed a pattern of mud lines on multiple walls of your crawlspace.  This is consistent with a ground water seepage challenge and why our repair plan called for drainage and a sump pump in your crawl space.  If asked what was found in our inspection, our policy is just to be candid.  We can\u2019t really speak to causality, but just to current conditions noted.\n\nHope this clears up any misunderstanding and we wish you the best with your repairs."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621663b63fdbf9:0xecb0ee1e38d7cfea"}

In spite of being very busy he always made us feel like we were important to him and made sure we knew exactly what was going on.  The repairs took two crews.  The first crew led by Luis G, working with Michael Moseley and Richard Warner installed the piers to stop the settling.  They did great work, never slowed down in spite of the rain that made a mess of everything, were always friendly and open to questions, and cleaned up the muddy mess better than I ever hoped for.  A great team of professionals.  The second team led by Gavin Dendy installed the SettleStop foam to raise the garage floor back up and stabilize it.  It was amazing to watch and they made it look effortless.  Gavin explained the process and made sure we understood and were satisfied before wrapping up and leaving.

When it rained the water would not drain properly in both of these locations.  AFS said that their injection program would fix both of these problems; in reality it was the start of making things much worse.  They drill a bunch of holes in the concrete and inject some material that is supposed to raise the concrete; unfortunately the whole concept is flawed.  They cannot control where this material goes as it is injected under the concrete and they are unable to correctly monitor the pressure as it goes in.  AS a result my walkway in back and my driveway ended up cracked and tilted in such a way that the problem was much worse; the water was now more directed towards my house.\nAFS tried to fix the driveway by cutting a 25 foot trench in my driveway and installing a drain; unfortunately this was also done incorrectly.  The slope of the drain did not allow the water to drain out, the drain was installed with large screws going into the drain pipe, which caught leaves creating a barrier.  Additionally, the cracks they created in the driveway and improper injection of the filler material caused my driveway to sag creating a lake that does not drain at all.\nAFS tried to fix the drainage problem made worse by their injection program in back by digging up part of the walkway and replacing the concrete; unfortunately, again they did not get it right.  They did not provide the proper slope to the new concrete and as a result the water make another lake immediately up against the side of my house.\nSo now I have worse drainage problems, my driveway looks like hell and as a result of the drainage problems the corner of my house at the garage is sagging.\nI would have been much better off if they had done nothing.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558126613083, "text": "Hello Mr. Ballard, we can certainly understand your frustrations.

I googled and researched different companies and contacted AFS along with others to come out and give us an estimate.  AFS proved to be the most dependable and reliable; AFS actually showed up on the date and time they were scheduled.  Michael Rosewarne was our certified foundation repair specialist.  He was excellent.  I was very impressed with Michael's knowledge and ability to make me understand what was going on with our home.  He showed me pictures and drew a diagram of what we needed for repair; he was very thorough.  He is a super nice person and is an amazing communicator.  Even after the fact, I called him, and he was very gracious, patient, and kind to walk me through activating my account with Greensky.   Our foundation repair team arrived as scheduled calling along the way to let us know their ETA.  Matt Fernandes and his crew were fantastic, super friendly, honest, and very respectful.  Matt explained everything he and his team would be doing.  Matt showed me pictures of everything they had done.  They did a superb job working diligently until they got the job exactly as it should be.  They left everything neat and in order.  I think most of the cracks in our home are already closing.

The Inspector/salesman was knowledgeable and made a sales pitch, but it lacked a few details. Like telling me someone had to be present on the 1st day during the soda blasting because they needed access to the inside of the house. The whole process seemed well coordinated for them. But, well-coordinated for them doesn\u2019t necessarily mean well-coordinated for me and I felt they were partially responsible for that due to the lack of key information and poor initial inspection. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could\n\nWhen I signed up, I thought I signed up for a thorough crawlspace inspection. What my Inspector did was gather just enough information about my crawlspace to fit into his sales pitch. It\u2019s probably best to do your own crawlspace inspection before you even call them out, because you may have to perform repairs before their crew comes out. They DO NOT employ plumbers, carpenters or electricians to handle possible crawlspace issues. They just want to sell you their system and once you sign that contract you can\u2019t back out without paying a 15% restocking fee.\n\nAfter the Inspector performed his inspection at my place, I found and had to deal with several issues. In accordance with the contract I was responsible for making sure there was power available in the crawlspace for the dehumidifier. When I go into the crawlspace to take care of this I see a wet spot from 15 feet away and realize I have a water leak. A closer look revealed I had water damage. I point blank asked that Inspector if he saw anything that required immediate attention and he said \u201cNo\u201d. There\u2019s no way he should have missed this. The \u201cInspector\u201d did come out and look at it and he did put me in touch with a carpenter, whom I did use, and I was able to get a plumber out quickly. But, with the expense of these repairs I would have liked to have pushed out the AFS work just to let my pocket book recover and make paying for the AFS work a little less taxing.

How long is the cord for the dehumidifier? What type of plug? Etc\u2026 What he didn\u2019t tell me was they needed 2 outlets for the job. I assumed 1 spot to plug in the dehumidifier would be sufficient, so I cleaned up an existing power connection for the sump pump in my crawlspace, making sure to leave them a spot to plug in the dehumidifier. When the crew came out on the first day they informed me they need a 2nd outlet for the pump that goes with the dehumidifier, so I\u2019m left scrambling that night to install another outlet.\n\nIt turned out I also had a strange issue with my AC ductwork that the AFS crew reported to me on the 1st day. I\u2019ll give the Inspector a break here and say he may or may not have discovered this if he had performed the type of inspection I expected. This turned into yet another unexpected expense on top of the carpenter and plumber. It would have been nice if the Inspector had caught all of this.

So it was decided I would have the work done.\nOn the two days the pier crew arrived, the crew chief Javier greeted me and we discussed the work progress and what they were doing each day.  Javier was ready to explain anything I was unsure about, with a short discussion on my expectations he and his crew was ready to get started. I have been around crews, and know how hard it is to get everyone going but without hesitation the crew was assigned work and they really got started. Along the way as I watched each of the crew was ready to explain what they were doing and why. It was great to see a crew that was self starting and knew their job so it could be accomplished with little delay. The second day the crew members changed a bit, but still  Javier was the crew chief, and again they started work soon after they arrived without delay and some conversations occurred at times to make sure what they were doing was the right way, because the situation of this repair was a little unusual, but they adapted to keep the work on time and with a professional attitude.\nThe third day the poly crew chief,  Dendy and crew arrived on time and immediately Dendy greeted me and explained what they were here for and ask to be shown the work area.  We discussed what he was going to do and how it would be accomplished and without delay, they got started preparing for the job of the day. They were always willing to explain the procedure and the expected results, and also how they would attempt to prevent any unwanted results.\nI want to commend all the personnel for their excellent work and their professionalism and accepting my sometimes unneeded suggestions and allowing me to express myself.\nThank you AFS for having happy crews, apparently they like working for AFS and proudly say so with a strong sense of belonging to a company who apparently cares about their employees.\n\nRobert Hendrix\nA  Satisfied Customer.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509053963738, "text": "Mr. Hendrix, we greatly appreciate your feedback, as well as your trust in AFS to complete your repair project!

The lady on the phone informed me that they would charge a $105 service fee, the cost of fuel, and for two hours of labor.  The total was around $350.  I am not joking.  I politely got off the phone with her, called Warrior Tractor, and within 10 minutes we had a truck with two guys pouring 5 gallons of fuel in.  They refused any payment.
