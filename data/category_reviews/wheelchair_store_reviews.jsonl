I walked up to the counter and stood there waiting to be acknowledged so I could ask for assistance, and they just continued to eat and decided I was not worth turning around for.. so after a few moments I decided that this was their customer service at their best and I was just going to have to find it myself.. I finally found the crutches behind me near the entrance (couldn\u2019t see them as I entered the store) as I searched for the right size for my wife, I noticed the size I needed was not marked, but a pair that was in the \u201cadult\u201d slot with no indication of the size.. I finally got there attention by asking \u201ccan you tell me what size these are\u201d.. I guess they REALLY weren\u2019t concerned about me when she responded \u201coh those are $25\u201d. I said \u201cok.. but what size are these?\u201d She walked over and said \u201cwhat size do you need?\u201d I told her 5\u20195 (adult) she looked through them, I guess thinking I was too dumb and hadn\u2019t thought to do the same.. and said \u201cwe have some in the warehouse, but it\u2019s closed, but you can come back on Monday and get them\u201d.  I asked what about these that aren\u2019t marked (clearly looking like the size I needed) oh those are the display, again confirming that she could have the crutches for me on Monday.

A friend drove me from my MD visit over to this merchant  and I hobbled inside.  I knew I would need to present my insurance information cards and make a payment.\n\nThe employee desks are situated at the very back of the room beyond the product displays. \"For sale\" reclining and lift chairs are located to the left,  then there is a huge group of walkers, wheel chairs, bathing safety seats etc located in the middle section of the store. Neither employee visible got up when we entered the store.\n\nAn employee called out something to us from the desk area.\n\nMy friend encouraged me to sit in the first reclining chair but as it was a floor product I hesitated to do this and  continued towards the back of the store towards the employees.  One of the employees finally said, \"you can sit in one of those chairs\".\n\nI AM trying to make a long story short.\n\nI ended up buying a cast boot, but they informed me that they did not take my insurance so I paid out of pocket for the item.\n\nThe first boot they tried on me was way too big and they quoted me a price of $89.00 for the item.\n\nIn the end they sold me a higher valued, smaller product at close to the price they originally quoted, so I will give them credit for honoring the price they quoted. That is why 2 stars rather than 1 star. (I think the real reason I got the lower price was because my friend advocated for me regarding the price. I could not hear what was said,  because I was still sitting over against the wall in a recliner,  and my friend was over at one of the staff desks.)\n\nThe staff did not appear to know or understand their products very well and did not really explain much about the boot I bought. They were not gentle or accommodating of my injured foot which was covered in a sock, but swollen and quite painful. The boot was not put on my foot/leg correctly. The tops of the two rigid metal posts that are covered in a hard, rough, scratchy Velcro product were up above the padding of the boot.  After a bit of struggling by the employees, I really just wanted to finish the process and get out of the store. My foot hurt and nothing they were doing was helping at all.  Later, after I got home,  my husband and I looked at the picture on the cast boot box.  The picture clearly showed the boot padding extending up above the two rigid metal posts.\n\nThe posts had already sanded away the skin on both sides of my calf/shin. My husband reassembled the boot correctly and put it back on my foot after putting bandages on the two sores on my calf.\n\nThis store needs to rethink the showroom set up. The employees and their desks should be located near the door.  I realize that their product storage and office space are located at the back of the store but they ARE selling medical devices for customers who probably have some kind of limitation. The employees are the ones who should be making the trek across the store. It might also be a good idea for them to have a wheelchair available just inside the door that they could direct a customer to, if needed,  as soon as they entered.  This would be another advantage to the employees being stationed near the door.\n\nLet me be clear. No one was rude to us, but, no one seemed very concerned either. The first girl who tried to help us must have been new and was not familiar with the  boot products.\n\nThis necessitated a second, presumably more experienced staff member also assisting us. The second staff member was pretty obviously not pleased that she had to become involved and was very abrupt with the first staff member.\n\nAll in all it is not an experience I would repeat.\n\nAfter I got home and was finally comfortable with the cast boot, I looked up cast boots on Amazon and I could have gotten a comparable or even better product at half the price. And, Amazon has great customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886266179711a56d:0x909b87d6f07bead6"}
