I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.

The first time when I moved to this area I dropped off my UHaul equipment here and a middle aged Army Veteran greeted me and helped with the process of the return. He also helped me to figure out the area and gave me some local information which was very helpful. Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge. His kindness, professionalism, and overall customer care is the entire reason UHaul still has my business.

I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626d1442a93003:0x7d8a498adb157034"}

I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...   Finally, at the end of the transaction I thanked him and stretched out my hand and he refused to shake it. Mr. Hall has a chip on his shoulder that needs to be challenged. I remain unhappy with your service. In the past I have rented storage space for 6 months, rented vehicles to move but that business will go elsewhere. I will be needing storage again but another company that can do the job correctly, that doesn't have an attitude that they were doing me a favor by poor quality work...that other company will get my business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.

After explaining to them that a code reading would bring no results to identify the issue. I did allow the vehicle to sit in my parking lot until the problem could be addressed. Most places charge several hundred dollars to do this. Several days later they brought in a switch from a junk yard that was ripped out and badly damaged. I told them they could not use part due to being damaged. After a couple days a night time worker offered to help with diagnostics, he brought his scan tool and tried to diagnosis the issue. Found the anti-theft module was not making any connection with the vehicles pcm. He spent over an hour trying to help your daughter for free. He normally charges $70 an hour for this.

Update (3-19-18) - When I picked up the truck from commercial van it was very dirty and there were little pieces of bed-liner plastic stuck all over the truck. It looked like over-spray, but they came off when I wiped them, thinking that this wouldn't be a problem I took the truck home (that was my big mistake). I didn't notice the paint chips until after I went home and washed all the little pieces of over-spray plastic off. There are 2 chips next to the drivers side Z71 emblem a gouge in the clear coat right above the drivers side tail light and 2 large chips in the clear coat between the bed and cab on the passengers side. All of these are in the immediate area around where they were working.  I also found a scuff where something rubbery with grit on it was dragged across my passenger rear door and had to use buffing compound to get it off. If you have work done there you need to stay and watch them, because as with any auto shop damage done will never be \"their\" fault.  Troy the owner called me this morning and asked if I was the one that wrote the bad review of his business. When I told him yes I wrote it he said that review is unnecessary and that I had planned to scam him from the start. When I got tired of listening to his accusations I hung up on him. He then calls me back and leaves a message telling me I was extremely unprofessional and I was no longer welcome at his business. As the owner of a business that relies on good experiences with customers it is HIS job to be the professional. And the professional thing to do would have been to ask me to bring it back so they could look at the damage instead of accusing me of being a scammer. All I was going to ask for was some touch up paint so I could fix it myself, but all I got was hostility and accusations. My father is going to get a bed-liner done on his truck, but he will not be using Commercial Van Specialists in Loxley. Troy and his \"business\" will never get another dime of my money, nor will they get any business from any of my family and friends.  When I give someone money to work on my vehicle I expect them to treat it and me with respect, but these people fall terribly terribly short.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6e8131eab6fb:0xa40d31008c34e55a"}

Years ago, I told the cashier I had a Cutlass, and he asked me what the make was. I told him, \"Dude, it's a Cutlass. It's an Oldsmobile.\" His response to me was, and I'm dead serious, \"Sorry man, cars aren't really my thing.\u201d\n\nBack in February, I needed a new alternator. Super simple, easy to find part, never had any trouble getting one for this car. Round one, the one they sold me was clocked wrong. We tried to clock it ourselves, because my car was immobilized 1hr 30min away and I didn't want drive to the nearest NAPA to return it. Well we took it apart wrong and broke all the wires.\n\nI took it back and explained what happened. They told me they couldn't do a warranty swap because I broke it. Which I'm sure is technically correct, but also a really bad way to handle it since the part they sold me was wrong, and I had the old one when they sold it to me. Two separate cashiers looked at the old one and the new one side by side and sold it to me anyway.\n\nI just bought a new one instead of fighting it for round 2. The guy that sold me the second one accidentally just gave it to me, assuming it was a warranty replacement, AND refunded me on my card, so I actually made money on this transaction. Which is a good thing because this one immediately whined because it had bad bushings straight out of the box.\n\nRound 3, I gave up and gave an auto shop a ton of money to buy one from a specialty shop already clocked and install it for me, because a 15 minute home repair was taking a week.\n\nA week or so, another shop thought they discovered a radiator leak (I later found out the top hose was just loose and spraying coolant, so this is all really ironic). I went back to NAPA and asked for advice. Fatal mistake.\nOne of the guys, and he's super nice but dumb as a box of rocks when it comes to cars, sold me some Radiator Stop Leak. I also bought some other radiator additive that supposedly helps rejuvenate the o-rings or something. Not sure how that is possible for something that doesn't actually go inside the cylinders, but this guy works at NAPA so I'm sure he's got this.\n\nHe tells me I can dump both of them into the radiator and it will be fine. I follow his advice and read the instructions on the bottle. The system had just been flushed and filled, and the radiator and water pump are less than 5 years old. I let the car idle for 15 minutes and run the heater full blast.\n\nI drive the car for 30 seconds and the hot light comes on, and the shift point for first gear has shifted up. I drive it to the shop and the guy immediately tells me I ruined my coolant system, and probably cooked the transmission, because Radiator Stop Leak is garbage and it does damage. They had to take the radiator out and all the hoses off and blow them out by hand, because the system was so clogged up they couldn't even flush it out with the radiator machine. It cost me $371.\n\nSo these $20 additives clogged up my cooling system to the tune of $371, and now I need a new transmission to the tune of $3,000.
