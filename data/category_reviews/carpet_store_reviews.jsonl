I was first told by both my Insurance adjuster and contractors that my carpet(only 2 months old) that recently got wet due to our refrigerator leaking, was fine to put back without having to replace it as the backing had not de-laminated and was sturdy. Since it was new carpet from rock bottom, I asked them to come take a look. they said if it even got a little wet, you HAVE to replace it, that carpet is gonna fail!! Well I aired on the side of caution, got the estimate. Rock bottom then said they couldn't guarantee the lot and dye of this style, that we should go ahead and put a deposit on it and set an install date, we did, but after further consulting with other carpet folks, we decided to cancel the order and wanted our money back. Rock bottom refused to call us back, for a week, and after many messages, I talked to Jeremiah a couple times and finally told him to cancel the install. Monday morning rolls around, I get the call from the installer, \"Hey, I got your carpet on the truck, am headed your way, be there in 20 minutes!!' I said no, I canceled that order, He then hung up on me! After reading the previous complaints, I should have looked here first before going to these guys. All I want is my $297.00 back. They can keep and re-sell the carpet. But no, they REFUSE to do that, they said either pay another $197.00 and pick up the carpet, or take the $297.00 loss. what is with these flooring companies around here? Had they been honest and up front with me about the cancellation policy, we would have been good. But no, they had to ignore my calls and requests for cancellation until it was too late.

Well, I was told approximately 5 days ago that my appointment was set for TODAY (Friday, June 19, 2020). I was told that the amount had to be paid in full the day prior to the appointment which was yesterday (Thursday).\nSo, went to the office (yesterday) and paid for my service in the full amount of  $1885. I was told that my appointment was set for Friday, June 19, 2020 and that the technicians would be at my location between the time window of 0900-0930. I verbally confirmed the time window for clarity before leaving the store because I dont live in the city and wanted to make sure that I had a good understanding.\n\nFriday is here. It is now 1114 am and no technician is here.. No one came at 0900. No one came at 0930. No one came at 0945. No one came or even CALLED me to inform me of their tardiness. It wasn't until 1025am that I decided to call the company and find out what was going on as I had already been waiting for approximately a hour.\nI called and told them that I was waiting on the technician and the customer service representative said they had an \"emergency and that is why are late\". I then said, \"Well, someone should have called me instead of having me waiting. Thats very unprofessional. Im a nice person but when I pay for a service I expect for that service to be rendered ON TIME or expect a phone call should an issue arise\" (those probably weren't my exact words). She then said that she would call me back and I said, \"Thank You\" and I hung up the phone.\n\nThe female called me back at 1040 and said, \"I just spoke with our guy and he will be there in about 30 to 40 minutes.\" I said, \"Thats unacceptable. I've been waiting for over and hour and you are telling me that I have to wait another 30 to 40 minutes? Do you think that's fair?\" She said, \"Well, If you had an emergency wouldn't you want...\" I interrupted her and said, \"Ma'am emergencies are understandable but you should have called me and let me know that your team was running late rather than just having me sitting here waiting for a hour.  Secondly,  you have a business,  the customer should never be held liable in any way for emergencies that arise on your end. I would not have been upset if you would have simply called me. At 0931 someone should have called me because I dont live in the area but I made it my business to be here at the time that you gave me.\"\nShe then said, \"I'm not gonna argue with you\". I said, \"You don't have too. I paid you to do a job and and I expect it to be done.\" I hung up.\n\nAt 1055, I received a text message from a female on behalf of the company(I guess because they had called me back twice but to no avail) stating that her \"guy\" was loading my carpet and would be here shortly. Lets see how long \"shortly\" takes. She apologized for the \"misunderstanding\".\n\nI just pray to that they install the carpet correctly.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cce798ef11cb5:0x74d68277ee9ae654"}

We disagree that \"they destroyed all the door frames\".  Yes, there was some slight damage done to some of the door frames but they were far from being \"destroyed\".  Your salesman offered to repaint those areas himself but you declined.  We have gone as far as discounting your invoice three times in an effort to appease you.  We have a two year labor warranty and we stand behind it.  The quality of work performed by subsequent contractors to correct the errors of the first was excellent.  Hill's Carpet & Floor Coverings has been in business at our main location since 1986.  The original owner sold the business to his nephew some 9 years ago and the original owner remains active in the business.  We are proud of our history of serving the greater Birmingham area by offering quality products, competitive prices, and professional installation.  We're proud of and humbled by so many positive reviews on line.  We recognize that the original installation fell short of the last standard and we have tried diligently to work with you to resolve your remaining issue."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888e658d00c7947:0x63e1001fc3410b5c"}

Very pleasant experience with Clark with setting up my consultation. Cullen came out and did the consultation with me and my husband. It went well, and the price was very reasonable. He advised me that he would email me the proposal and to call him when we were ready.\n\nI waited for the email but never received it. However, I still called a week later and let him know we were ready to schedule but that I still haven't received the proposal email. I didn't feel comfortable calling to pay my deposit over the phone without a proposal. He wasn't at the office when I called but was going to call once he got settled. When he finally called, I wasn't available but I still didn't get a proposal email.\n\nSo I waited before calling back. Then Clark called and left a msg asking if my consultation went well and if I was ready to schedule. At that time I was not because I wanted the proposal on paper with the amount I was quoted. Never heard back.\n\nSo I called again Monday, 10/12 and spoke with a gentleman about scheduling (yes I was still willing to use this company because the price I was quoted was the best). He got my name and address and tried to look up an invoice or proposal and guess what, there was none!! He asked who did my consultation and I told him Cullen. He said he would get him to call me. Days later, I'm still waiting on my call.\n\nThe other 2 companies I've contacted this week have been very responsive and gotten me proposals within the same day of the consultation. I'd rather pay the extra $ for great customer service and communication.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602795297698, "text": "Ms. Holmes, your experience with our company is very regrettable.

We asked her what type of floor she was looking for so we helped her get a waterproof floor that she asked for. She had over 100 options to choose, yes we have a great variety at great low prices. Theirs was a 5mm/20mil wear layer at only $1.49 Sf by the way. She even took a sample of the entire piece. When they came to return the floor the installer came with her and he said that he seen the piece when they brought it to their home, he said that he seen the sample  when he was at the store. Why he did not mention he could not install that type of floor in that house we do not know (this was before the purchase was made). We gave her the floor she chose not a wrong one. She also read and signed a receipt that she still has that specifically says **no refunds** that\u2019s why we let people take samples so they make sure they take the correct floor for their home. As many people here know that this is a family and USMC veteran owned and operated store and we treat people with respect. We have extensive knowledge about flooring and helped her get a floor that was waterproof that they did not want to install. We then proceed calling our supplier which does take returns at a 20% cost. Which they claim we stole but we have to give that to our supplier to return the floor just like any other store that charges restocking fees for special orders. We tried to help them and get their money even though we do not take returns and they accepted the 20% from the supplier. We never sold a wrong floor. The customer saw and took a sample and we gave her that exact floor that all the names and numbers match to the sample to the receipt and to all the boxes they took. We never sold a wrong floor. We\u2019re just following store policies that she was well aware of when she signed and payed for her floor."}, "gmap_id": "0x888925dfcab2f593:0x34e9f2c50edd6c0b"}

So I decided to shop at Carol's Carpet in Prattville. That was the best decision i ever made! I walked in and her comes this wonderful, cheerful and so happy you stopped by lady name Kasey. i instantly felt like i was home after a long trip and my family was so excited to see me. Kasey has a natural way of making customers feel like she knew you before you ever walked in Carol's Carpet. I told Kasey what i was looking for and my budget. I also told her the color of my kitchen cabinets so the color of the floors needed to work well in the kitchen and throughout the house.  After that Kasey completely took over. She knew exactly what floors i needed to match my cabinets, and they were BEAUTIFUL and EXACTLY what i had vision.  My floors were install and WOW is the one word that comes to mind. i am so happy Kasey saw my vision by just listening to me because i had never purchased floors before. So to have a person like Kasey to take over and help me the way she did i am forever grateful to her. Even after my floors were install Kasey will frequently check in to see how i am doing with my new floors. She is a special one! If you ever need floors go see Kasey in Prattville. I highly recommend her.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e85690467a8e3:0xd819d5162c9f45dd"}

Within the first few months the floor visibly began to cup and buckle and remains that way today. \tThe owner said he would, \u201cmake it right!\u201d \tWe have had to contact Old Gin Carpets over and over trying to get them to address this problem. However, well over a year after installation the problem with our floors remains. Our business with Old Gin Carpets has resulted in a loss of over $10,000 to repair the problem.\n\nAs part of a remodeling effort in our home, we had Old Gin Carpets install wood flooring in our main living area. After a few months we noticed a problem that I will refer to as \u2018cupping\u2019 on the new flooring. This effect was evident in all areas of the floor and worsened also resulting in \u2018bowing\u2019 in places where the floor raised high enough that it became a tripping hazard. I provided photos to Old Gin which was eventually followed by a visit from the owners, They told me that they had never seen anything like this and that they would do whatever needed to be done to, \u201cmake it right!\u201d I had hoped that such a strong statement by the owner would surely lead to a resolution.\n\nUnfortunately, months followed and it\u2019s been well over a year now since the flooring was installed. During that time we have lived with the constant embarrassment and humiliation of having to explain to guests why our floors are messed-up and why in all this time it hasn\u2019t been fixed. Old Gin has had multiple flooring inspectors look at the issue, but no exact cause has been mentioned. I have consulted with 2 licensed general contractors who have independently concluded that the lack of installation of a proper vapor barrier beneath the flooring is the most likely cause. It was also determined that there were no existing water leaks. I have also examined the National Wood Flooring Association and the flooring supplier\u2019s own Installation Guidelines, Methods and Instructions that validates what I was told by these general contractors that more preparation should have been done prior to installation.\n\nOld Gin was paid in full at the time of the installation. Our expectation of a North Alabama BBB A+ rated company would be one that would stand behind their products and service. It seems like it has been impossible to get resolution and it will end up costing us twice as much to repair as we will now have to remove the damaged floor and install a new one. This problem has taken far too much time and effort to address and many excuses have been given for the great delay in fixing the floor.\nWe feel that Old Gin has not been truthful in providing their products and services and that they have not met our expectations. Relative to the ideals listed by Old Gin Carpets on their website, we certainly have not been the focus of their business, we have not been happy with the product and we have received zero value for our money. In fact, we feel that they have flat-out taken us for our money!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212bb9c084277:0xcfa30894660c0db6"}
