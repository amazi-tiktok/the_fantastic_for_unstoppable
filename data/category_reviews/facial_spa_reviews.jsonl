They tried to fix the problem by toning this portion. By toning the hair I no longer had highlights in this portion leaving the hair a reddish dark color on the root in contrast to the blond. They offered to provide additional highlights on another visit but I would still have to pay for the lightener. I was told $13. The next time I came within 7 days to have the lightener done to fix the toned area without highlights. It became apparent the learning leaders only add a small amount of lightener to each extra bowl needed to lighten so they can up charge $13 per bowl. I have noticed this in the past. This time I was charged for 3 bowls. The instructor said these extra bowls were not necessary, however the instructor allowed the student to use this amount. In addition to the bleeding mistake that occurred the previous time without proper supervision, I was disappointed by the poor customer service given by the instructors and poor business strategy taken by charging the customer for a mistake that was done under the lack of care by the learning leader. I have recommended this school in the past, but I will no longer do so.

We appreciate your honest feedback and you're absolutely right-we are a school! Our students are all at different levels of skill based on several factors including, but not limited to, length of time they have been in the program and the specific areas in which they excel. You may not have known this, but we have a 100% guarantee and you can always let us address any issues you might have had with your service. Students work on guests because they need the hands-on experience which is part of their curriculum. Students aren't ready for the salon until they have completed their program, hours, and have taken both their written and state board exams. They are then ready to transition to an actual salon. We also have students who are in a program here we call Phase 2. These students must pass an interview and hands-on assessment in makeup, cutting, color and texture. These \"master level\" students are available upon request and you'll be getting a more advanced, driven student that is much further along in their program. However, these services do cost a bit more. All that being said, we have to remember that we are a school, first and foremost. We love being able to offer extremely low (much lower than an actual salon) prices for our guests because our students need the hands-on experience. We can all remember the first time we tried to accomplish something...sometimes it was great, but sometimes we also had a lot to learn from the experience. But with practice and patience, we got so much better than when we started and that's exactly how it is for our students. We hate that you weren't happy with your hair, but we do appreciate the time you gave our student in letting them perfect their craft."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

I am saddened by the fact that they messed my hair up and won\u2019t fix it for the integrity of their establishment. I left a message for the manager and have not gotten a response back. This happened about a month ago. In my book, that\u2019s a sign of being unprofessional.

Unfortunately, Olivia A. Salon is not the place for me.  I went in for an acrylic fill with gel on top and while everyone was friendly  I left unhappy with my nails.   The result was chunky, overly thick, and uneven.  It looked worse than press on nails glued and painted by a child.  The nail technician did NOT use a drimmel or motorized file but used a foam hand file to take off my existing and layer of acrylic.\nAt first this seemed nice but I was mistaken.  She was unable to file the smaller sectional of my nail bed and ended up filing skin which hurt.  My nails were embarrassing to look at as they appeared malformed and lumpy.  When she applied the gel she used 3 very thick coats of color that didn't dry under the light and were soft to the touch.  To be fair, I'm picky with my nails and when I saw the manicure going south I didn't say anything.  I should have.  Instead I left and went straight to another nail salon.  At the next salon they showed my Quasi-Modo nails around and laughed.\nThe salon itself is easy enough to find but the level of aesthetics is less than what I like.  They clearly want to be a high end salon but the quality is not quite there.  In addition, the prices were NOT worth it!  They charged $10 over what any other salon does.  The people were nice and they fit me in.  And I want to make it clear, I did not say anything to the lady.

The two employees behind the desk greeted this reviewer, offered her something to drink, and informed the stylist of her arrival.  Because it was now after closing time, the two front desk employees left for the day.  This reviewer was not left alone or ignored at any time.  The stylist who volunteered to stay late, finished with the client she was with and was on time for this reviewers scheduled appointment.  This reviewer had her hair shampooed, had more of a trim than a cut, and blown out.  She was charged $15.  Her comment about being charged three times what she should have been charged... Well, I don't know where a woman can get her hair shampooed, cut/trimmed, and blown out for $5.  She did say she was new to the area, so maybe she could get the above service done for $5 where ever she moved from...Just to be clear, Bliss does not offer shampoos, haircuts, and styles for $5....  I noticed she did not mention the amount she was charged.   Could it have been she as embarrassed to admit that she thought $15 was \"three times more than what it should have been.\" Because this reviewer posted this review under her name and because we had her phone number on file, I called and inquired about her time at Bliss.  I stated I was the owner and was making follow up calls with our new clients.  I did not  mention I had read her review but instead asked how she enjoyed her visit with us.  I gave her every opportunity to relate any unpleasant experience she might have had.  I was told that Bliss is a beautiful place and was thanked for taking her appointment on such short notice and after hours.  When asked how she like her hair cut even thought it really was only a trim, she responded \"I like it, she did a good job.\" During our conversation, she never said anything negative about her visit at Bliss, and when I invited her to return in the future she said she would.  To be honest, she has not returned .  I wish she had given us another chance so that she could experience what Bliss is really about.  I would also like to respond to the comment about the service being done half-hearted and with no conversation.  The stylist's mother had just passed away very unexpectedly two weeks earlier.  She was still mourning her loss but trying to live as normal as possible and continue to work and support herself.  While this reviewer had no clue what was happening in our stylist personal life, I think because of the comment she made in her review for all to read, its important for you to know why our stylist was not her usual outgoing friendly self.   I am very interested in making each client feel welcome and appreciated.  I personally follow up with as many clients as possible to make sure that their time at Bliss was relaxing and that they are satisfied with their service.  I know this has been a lot to read, but I wanted to give a little more information about the above review.  I am sure I am not the only business owner that is willing to go above and beyond what is normal to make their guest happy.  If something is not what you are expecting, please let us know.  Give us the opportunity to \"fix\" it.  Our guest are the reason we even have a business and we understand that, without \"you\" we wouldn't be here.  We look forward to seeing you and making you feel \"special\" like the person you are!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d61a6391ccb:0x7321ebb76dd3fc84"}

Unfortunately, what you described above was not what actually happened. As I tried to explain to you and your mother, you had layers of dark brown/black box color all over your head. My main goal is to always keep the integrity of our customer's hair in great condition. We could have easily blasted your hair with bleach and a high volume developer in an effort to remove the dark box color. However, that runs a much higher risk of damaging your hair. Instead, we chose to start with Redken's Pre-Art treatment. This treatment removes all types of things from the hair including, minerals, products, and some artificial color. It also helps to ensure that we get the best possible results from any coloring service as it helps to create a 'blank canvas' on the hair. We did that treatment on you twice, and then brought you back to the bowl to start with a 'soap cap' on your ends. A 'soap cap' is a mixture of bleach (lightener), shampoo and water. This allows the hair's integrity to also be maintained as it starts out much less aggressively removing color from the hair. It was during this process at the shampoo bowl that your mom inquired about pricing. We told her that all our color correction services start at $150/hour. She made the statement that you are 18 and booked the service online without knowing what correct questions to ask. She said you thought you would be able to achieve the blonde hair you wanted on a half price color day, so the total would end up being somewhere around $75. I am sorry for the misunderstanding. Going from a dark brown box color to a light blonde, while maintaining the integrity of your hair, is not a cheap process. It requires time, skill, knowledge, patience, and realistic expectations. Your mom said she would simply prefer to pay for the Pre-Art treatment and the soap cap and you would just leave 'as is' because you didn't want to pay the price for the full service. We never told you that you couldn't achieve the result you wanted. In fact, we told you that we absolutely could get you there! But it would be a process. You are not alone in this process. Anyone who has ever had dark colored hair and eventually achieved light blonde hair can empathize with you. It's not easy, and it's certainly not a 1-2 hour process. Trust me, if I could wave a magic wand and get you there I would. But it's my responsibility to you, as a customer, to do it the correct way and make sure you still have hair on top of your head by the end of it. I am sorry that because of a misunderstanding or miscommunication that it made you want to rate my business negatively on google. My customers are very important to me. I apologized over and over before you left to both of you and tried to explain this process and why it was so important that we do it the right way. I hope this helps to clear up any confusion about what happened on our end. I want you to be happy with your hair, and I want to help in any way I can. Please feel free to contact us and I will work with you on getting your hair color to where you want it to be. As I was more than willing to do at your initial appointment. Take care!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88893ff6535421f5:0xe467b9c2cd19892e"}

The only thing that I found upsetting after I was sooo very \ud83d\ude0a with the hair, was the total! $600!! Now,  the total shouldn't be a mystery while you are getting it done. It should be discussed about how much it will be when you are describing what you want to the stylist while she is evaluating your hair. And if its too high, then a different affordable approach. I'm not educated in this field, so I have no idea what steps have to be taken or how much those steps are, such as the $150/ hr. that I was charged. I was told differently on the appt. call.

Please have your sister contact us directly. Every lash removal is charged for a lash removal. There has never been a time when our lash artists have approved not being paid for their time to remove a client\u2019s lashes. I would like to speak with her so I can find out who misconstrued that information to her to cause such confusion as both of our Guest Experience Experts that handle scheduling, know that it is a service that always costs since it requires proper training and techniques to not compromise the client\u2019s natural lashes.\n\nThere a multitude of factors that go into lashes not lasting long. And in this case, your sister, I\u2019ll withhold her name too for the reasoning you stated, was informed for the beginning that she had short natural lashes - and going as long as she wanted to go could lessen the amount of time they would last. Getting them wet at all within 24 hours and proper at home protocols not being followed will also shorten the time.\n\nAll of this is explained at the appointment as well as some of it is notated on the waiver signed in the beginning of the appointment.\n\nAgain, please have your sister contact us directly so we discuss ways we can properly rectify this situation with her. Thanks!\n\n***edited to add: I see she was already refunded a FULL refund for her full set 4 days ago. I\u2019m not sure what else we can do to rectify this situation more than we have.

The first two treatments cost me $150. The second time I came in my specialist informed me that the prices will raise to $200 per IPL session. No problem for me, well... I came in earlier this week to get only CHEEKS and CHIN done and she charged me $350$!!! NO ONE informed me it would be that high! Last time I came in I was told $200. $350 for a partial face treatment is absolutely insane price. I\u2019ve been getting these treatments done all over the country and I\u2019ve NEVER had anyone charge me that much for a partial face IPL. Honestly, she should have told me before the treatment that it would be that much! I\u2019ve seen her three times. I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal about it by the time she charged me because I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene but I\u2019m honestly very unhappy with the lack of communication from this business.

Reason for one star...\n\nThe services I asked for and what I actually received in turn was not good at all. I went in for a facial threading, wax, and lash extensions yet when I went home and looked at the work done via my closeup magnifying mirror I saw lots of hair still on my face and many missed hairs on my mustache area despite being plucked as well, so attention to detail definitely royally lacking in this area.\nNow, the service on my lashes was actually even worse. I went in with a picture of what style and length of lashes I was wanting and instead I left with the complete opposite as the so-called technician had admitted that she decided to go a couple of sizes up on length despite what I had requested, as well, she had missed some areas where there were gaps and so I asked for those areas to be filled and lashes trimmed since they were too long (not what I asked for), although she claimed she fixed them, NOT, I was treated with frustration and impatience after the touch up I asked for to the point that she left me in the room and didn't come back to check on me or say anything, she just went out and took another customer which clearly expressed to me that she was done with me despite the fact that she didn't do what I had asked for but instead what she wanted to do. And, after looking closer at them when I got home thru my magnifying mirror they looked horrid as all the glue was visible (not black glue) and stuck to many of the lashes which caused them to clump together and they were still too long. I really tried to deal with them, followed all the instructions (that by the way I was told upon leaving to take a picture of from their taped sheet on a mirror, really!), the best that I could but the length of them was just not natural looking to my face and the horrid clumped up lashes was just to much to deal with, SO, so disappointing.  It was even obvious by every one's look on their face when they saw me and some clearly said so. I finally had to have them carefully removed the next week. I WILL NEVER EVER, EVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE NOR WOULD I EVER RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE I KNOW, and I am not one to give bad reviews but in this case there was just too much of the bad to go around, just shameful! \u2639\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude1f...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917afd52227e1:0x2b150ddbd8c8374a"}

I have not gone to a single place on Highway 280 that has made me pay more than $35 for a full set WITH gel polish. The man that did my nails put so much acrylic on top of them that they looked like acrylic blobs by the end of it, at first I thought he was going to shape them, thin my nails out, but then he slapped some oil on my hands and said OK thanks. Never said a word to me the entire time, was extremely rude, and when I asked that he please thin my nails out, he grumpily got up and went and got the machine to do so. The owner (I\u2019m guessing) walked up and asked him what he was doing, he told her, and she told him to go tend to someone else. He threw down the machine and threw up his hands and stomped off. While she did a great job at fixing my nails, she seemed just as angry as he was at having to fix them, and only said something to me, and got in a chipper mood once I handed her a five dollar bill as a tip. At the counter she handed me my receipt without telling me the price, and it was $55 total. I looked up and said \u201c$55 for a full set?\u201c As I had called before going in, and was told over the phone that it would be $35. She grabbed a sign that was hidden behind the counter and pointed to where it said $55 for a full set with gel polish. I paid and left, and as if trying to make things better, she gave me stamp card where if I go so many times I get a free service or money off or something.

They create the experience you want when you are pampering yourself. The owners are exceptionally kind and welcoming to all of their customers. I have been coming here since they opened 5 years and I have recommend them to everyone since my first experience.\n\nI find the review left below mine to be rather convoluted and contrary in content. The salon provides a list of the services offered, a polish removal would not be in the Pedicure menu on their selection chart and would not include a cuticle cut (Which Alabama does not allow) or foot scrub. If a pedicure was chosen from the menu and those services were not provided and nothing was said at the time of service, then waiting to post a negative review after paying for services you didn't get, is cowardice and absurd.\n\nTo state that a 50% tip was left on top of services you didn't even obtain, well that is just plain silly. I find it hard to believe that this is even a valid review but instead is a charge at the salon in backhanded fashion.\n\nIf services are not to your liking at the time of delivery, that is on YOU for not speaking up, and not up to the salon to have to try to disprove your statement. Did you give them the opportunity to correct their errors?\n\nI wasn't there and can't speak for the experience but I find it odd of a self stated industry worker would go to another salon, accept a \"lack of service and kindness\" and wait to walk out and post a negative response online instead of \"adulting\" and asking for the services expected.

I love Thi the most because she is so detail oriented. She is always attending classes and seminars to update the techniques they use, the polish they offer and the methods they use to do nails. I have seen a few comments on pricing here. They do not have the most competitive prices however, you pay for what you get. I never walk away from this salon dissatisfied. I never feel like it is not clean or like I am not being treated properly. I am not offered low services here. If you want competitive pricing then you probably want a low-grade salon and not one of this magnitude. The salon is extremely upscale and is ran by very honest individuals.

Dont worry about it.\"  So I left and I was a little hurt by the customer service I had received at this point and I went back in to ask if they were apart of the BBB, because at this point I saw where this was going.

I'm African American and I am just wondering if I wasn't, if it would've made a difference at all. I called to ask about the policy because I want to be treated fairly. The phone disconnected while I was asking and when I called back it went to voicemail. I called back from a different number and the phone was answered then it was passed to a man works there and he was even more rude than the young lady working at the front. I was in shock how fast he got annoyed with me and I wasn't being disrespectful at all. He then said that if I called back he would file harassment charges against me, then hung up me in my face.

We apologize for the experience you received that day as we were closed the entire week for Thanksgiving.\nI am the only one that works there along with my office assistant. We both do not recall seeing you, maam, and if we did, we surely would have greeted you at the door. Now, sometimes one of our children would be up front once in awhile to grab something for us from the desk and as we have always told them not to open doors for strangers, it possibly could've been one of them. So, as I only work as appointment only, my door remains locked at all times. Again, Ms. Debra, we apologize for your experience.\n\nFor future reference, we will be closing our doors Jan. 15th as I will be moving to Vestavia and Odenville. You may visit my website or facebook for all info if you wish to receive any service from me in the future, maam.\n\nThank you, Ms. Debra.\n\nwww.lemilabeauty.com"}, "gmap_id": "0x88897d17a435a295:0x6f0f4c88b060f178"}

I went in with some tension in my shoulders and upper back (pregnancy during a pandemic can be stressful \ud83e\udd23) so I called prior to my appointment to ask if the prenatal massage could be customized and if I could have more of a focus in that  area rather than in my lower back that typically accompanies pregnancy. Of course, the ladies up front that answered my call were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to check with the therapist instead of just placating me with some generic answer. They were also very friendly and professional when I arrived.\nOnce it came time for my massage, Tara explained everything first and made me feel completely at ease and comfortable. I did add on the Lavender aromatherapy and wondered if it would be worth it or not due to wearing a mask. It. Was. Worth. It. Just do it. You won\u2019t regret it. The massage itself was excellent and met all of my standards. There was a time or two that I almost felt like asking her to move on to a different area because the pressure was beginning to be too much for me (it was a good hurt, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just a wimp), but it was almost as if she was so in tuned with me that she moved on before I got to that point. At checkout, they were offering  a wellness package, and while I passed on it due to the fact that I\u2019ll be having a baby soon and won\u2019t have the availability for a while, it is definitely something I\u2019ll consider in the future.

I had an appointment this evening at 5pm, but woke up experiencing illness so wanted to reschedule my appointment, especially in light of the Covid-19 climate we are still in. I called their office first thing (8am) and explained my illness to Debra and informed her I would like to reschedule. She gave me several run-arounds concerning why even though I was sick I could not reschedule. Even so much as stating the owners are the reason why if a patron feels ill they still have to be serviced. She then said half of my Massage Envy points banked for today\u2019s service would be expensed because of the same day reschedule. I asked what concessions are made for feverish patrons. She said they are still required to show up and Massage Envy would take their temperature. I told her I would be going to the doctor\u2019s office today and could provide an excuse. She said a manager would get back with me today, but no one ever contacted me. After having my suspicions proven that I had been lied to and no one would contact me, I called back to ask about what was the current status of my appointment/points. I was then informed the appointment was taken off the records and all of my points for today\u2019s session had been expensed. I am extremely frustrated with their \u201ccustomer care\u201d. I feel lied to and with their \u201cCovid protocols\u201d that were exhibited today first-hand to me, I will NEVER feel comfortable patronizing them again. There is no telling how many patrons who have been ill (with or without fevers) have received service and unintentionally spread it to others with the help of this location\u2019s policies.

The bed warmer was either not on or not working.... Bummer. Also, the light in the room was on the whole time... I like it dark and relaxing. Rooms need to be vacuumed.\ud83d\ude1e\n\n2. My MT was clearly sick with something respiratory going on. Being that close and breathing over me sick was a major deterrent on a return visit. Not sure if he kept stopping the massage to wipe his nose or what but I've never had so many pauses in a massage. \ud83d\ude37I'm used to smooth continuous pressure/ touch during a massage except for when its time to turn. Also, no hot towels this time!!!\ud83d\ude29\n\n3. I feel like this particular chain is on the downhill... The past few times I've gone, you can never get the same therapist twice. It appears there is a lot of turnover here. It is noisy in the hallway out side of the room. I made sure to use all of my gift card so my friends and family can start giving me new gift cards to use somewhere new.\ud83d\ude10\n\n4.

He will not call me back and he is never in or so they say.  Massage Envy advertises transferring a credit to another member's account (for a fee).  They have charged the fee and have yet to transfer the credit to my sister's membership at another location out of town. Twice now they have set up a guest account for her in Hoover, even after a detailed phone call on May 9, 2016 with a front desk staff to try and rectify this situation because when my sister asked her location if it had transferred and they let her know they had set up a guest account for a half hour in Hoover.  After no help from the Hoover location I called my sister's location out of town and they walked me through how simple the process is to transfer and they themselves cannot understand why I am having issues.

I did not like that she did not ask about what styles I wanted or what outfits/colors I'd be wearing when she did the styles. On my wedding day, I requested she use a purple lipstick (subtle, not dramatic), but she went with a bold pink color instead. The hair she did for my wedding was nothing like she did for the included practice run. My hair started immediately falling down during my engagement photos, I told Chika my concerns when I came in for my wedding hair and she assured me my hair would hold all day. It did not. People were constantly having to add new bobby pins to my hair, despite Chika's promise. I also didn't like how obvious it was that my hair was covered in hairspray.\n\nDiana Langseth: My husband and I have been using Diana for our regular hair cuts and eye brow waxing. I feel that she doesn't understand what we want, despite specifically telling her the problems were having. She also could do a much better job when it comes to waxing men's eyebrows. She's very nice, but unfortunately, she doesn't seem to give us what we want.\n\nLisa Davis: Lisa did my underarm, full leg, and Brazilian wax before my wedding. She was very nice and chatty throughout and told me what she was doing and what was and wasn't going to hurt. However, she did not wax the upper portion of my thighs for my full leg wax and I had to go back over spots in the underarm and Brazilian wax, as well. She also finished a full hour before expected, which I wouldn't have minded if I hadn't had so many problems with my results.\n\nKatie Ung: I saw Katie to have my nails done for my engagement photos and wedding day. I really didn't like the shape she did with the french tips. She did not offer any lengthening solutions (if that was the problem) or recommend another style (if that was the problem). I went straight from my nails appointment to my engagement photos and I made Katie aware that was the case beforehand. At the end of my appointment, I told her there was white all over my fingers. She said it would come off after a couple washes at home. I was very unhappy I had to go to my photos with this on my hands, because she had been sloppy with the polish.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597805713362, "text": "OMGoodness Becca, I'm so sorry at no point during your multiple visits with us we're you happy with our work.

She is absolutely the best!  She never knows what to expect from me because I'm always asking to change things up and try new styles and colors.  I almost ALWAYS come armed with a Pinterest picture to show her and she's always game for whatever plan I walk through the door with.  She's even called and talked to my previous stylist back in Kansas to find out what methods work best on my hair, which is temperamental about holding color.  In fact, with my last visit, I was her last appointment of the day (on a Friday....right before she was planning to go on vacation) and she stayed late with me (after almost everyone else had gone home) to make sure that the red highlights that I requested were the right intensity.  She ended up putting on a different volume of glaze that made it pop just the way I wanted!  I love that she's willing to hang with me through all of my crazy requests and if I tell her that something doesn't look quite how I imagined it, she works with it till we get it the way I want it.  And, if I try a style that is new for me, she walks me through the steps to style it and maintain it.  Like I said....the best!  The salon is great too.

My eyebrows are now two different shapes/thicknesses and the areas that I NEEDED waxed weren't even touched.

Today, they were booked so I decided to use their licensed esthetician, Shelly, assuming she would do a good job due to her job title and professionalism of her coworkers. I asked for a clean up, no shaping or thinning. Initially, I thought they looked fine but once the redness calmed down and I saw clearer in my own mirror, the horror set in. First of all, my once thick eyebrows are now basically one single file line of hair because they are so thin. But that isn\u2019t the worst part. The worst part is that they were waxed so heavily in the middle that my eyebrows now sit 4 fingerbreaths apart from each other. They were waxed at no angle, so they are essentially chopped straight off mid way from the middle, drawing a line from the middle of my eyeball up. I am completely embarrassed and to make matters even worse, I was having them waxed for my engagement photos coming up in 2 weeks that, needless to say, will have to be delayed. I cried the whole way home. If I return, I will only be seeing Rachael or Phyllis, but it is a high likelihood that I will never go back.

I asked if I could reschedule for tomorrow (I need my hair done before my photoshoot in DC this Monday) and she said maybe, but they don't want to schedule me and then make their other morning appointment wait. Oh, it is okay to not see me at all because you messed up, but not okay to push someone else back to fit me in?
