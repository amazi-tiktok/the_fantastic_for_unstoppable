I took them home and 2 of the plants have done great but by the following Thursday the third plant had completely shriveled up and died.  It took me another week to get to the greenery to show them my dead plant.

I feel like with so many competitors and options of places to shop that in the end helping me and switching it out would have been no big deal at all.  It was a $14.99 plant.

Selection, quality, resources and staff are all great.  However, they will not hold up to their 1 year guarantee.  I brought a plant in that had died.  I bought 4 total, 1 didn't make it.  The lady there quickly got on the defensive and stated, we can't take that back in a nasty and rude way.  Then she proceeded to go through a list with me from planting to watering to see if she could find a reason to blame the plant's death on me.  She went with improper watering schedule.  I told her I have an irrigation system.  She asked me how much water it is putting out, I responded, \"I don't know the exact output yet, but all the other plants are doing well which is a good indication.\"  And that was not good enough for her.  So, I just gave up.  It was clearly going to be an issue not worthy of the stress.
