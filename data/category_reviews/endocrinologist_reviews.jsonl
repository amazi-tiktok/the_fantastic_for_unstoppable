The morning of surgery, Dr. Habermacher came into room I ask if he was going to do scan to make sure stone was gone, he replied no, it will be gone today one way or another. I had passed very small pieces of stone but definitely not a 7mm in prior week.When I awoke from procedure I was told there was no stone, after getting home I was very sick from procedure and very sore. I went for my follow-up, I told the girl that checked me in that I was upset that he did not do KUB to make sure the stone was gone also, that I am a nurse and have had enough of kidney stone patients to know how to check for kidney stones and I definitely had not passed a 7mm. She said I will tell him, she immediately came back in room and said this is a nurse visit, he wants you to do 24 hr urine and come back in 2 months. I have no intentions of ever using him again, why would you not do a KUB or scan to make sure it's gone before putting someone through this, it sounds like it's all about money to me.
