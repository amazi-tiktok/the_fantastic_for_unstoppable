Cashier rudely told me this after canceling my request just say rude hitting the buttons hard to stop it. I don\u2019t care what the demographics are. I am a general manager to be clear. Non of these actions are justified because not all customers should be given the issue because of color or the area.

India who is always on her phone ringing up customers, snarling at people she doesn't like, and just being plain rude. Tonight I went in and asked where I could find a green polo shirt bc I planned on being India for Halloween to make light of a situation that really hurt my feelings. To be followed around a store bc of the color of my skin. So to make matters worse after asking Carrie the manager where I could find a polo she told me the thrift store. So then I told her I was going to be India . Carrie was furious. She berated me and told me and all the other customers in the store it was their job to follow people that are stealing around dollar tree as if I was stealing . She yelled that India was doing her job and that it didn't matter which color the person was. Making it seem as if I am a thief. I'm in total disbelief bc I've known Carrie the manager for years. But the way she acted and talked to me tonight amongst other shoppers was ridiculous, mentally scarring, and just plain bad for business. I literally shop in dollar tree every single day. But this could all be changed very soon . Thanks to Carrie having a bad day. Then to make the situation my worst yet this year. I was apologizing to the cashier ringing me up telling her I knew the objectives of their job bc I was offered a management position about a year ago and had a application for the job in my car . Carrie the manager walks out and tells me to shut up and that the conversation is basically over. I said Carrie I was not talking to you I was speakkng to the cashier. I think it's sad when a person brings their personal life to work. I know Carrie has problems at home. So I told her I didn't know what she bad going on but I knew this wasn't her .

It is nothing to be making a purchase and the cashiers are on the phones arguing with their boyfriends.  There is another Family Dollar down the road and I will pass this one to instead shop at that one.  Family Dollar places these stores in mostly black neighborhoods, and does just enough, which is deplorable.  I should never go in a store where I am purchasing any foodstuffs and see rodents running across the floor.

The cashier stated they were not sure what bill i gave them they assumed it was a dollar bill. The manager proceeded to attempt to count down the drawer but it was taking a long timee i told them i had my dog in the hot car. After i continued to complain about how long it was taking rather rudely i confess eventually i was given back my $10 bill and quarter an asked to leave without my merchandise. i had to use extra gas money to go to another store for that store not to have what i was looking for. The employees @ this dollar tree are rude unprofessional and untrained in operating a register. Corporate needs to retrain these employees and monitor the customer service of these store employees.

Now they don't put anything on the shelves. The manager, Stephen, whom I thought was so friendly, told one of my white friends that a lady comes in and gets all their supplies. I guess that's why nothing is even on their shelves anymore. I drive almost two hours to find supplies for myself, my kids, and others. I know for a fact they had 22 units as they called the boxes and then another truck. So tell me why they didn't put out any supplies: Disinfectant wipes, lysol, microban, dg disinfectants or alcohol. I find it hard to believe that out of 4 loads not one single cleaning items. My money is green to. I have an autoimmune disease and I need stuff myself.

They do not help you with this either, and most times the buy so much, get so much off does not work at checkout, and 9 times out of 10, the sale prices are not marked in the store,  so you don't even know you're getting them until you look at your ticket.
