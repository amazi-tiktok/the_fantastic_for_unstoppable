I boarded my kitty for July 4th weekend; it was her first time being boarded.\n\nWhen I picked her up, she was skeletally thin, which I did not notice until I took her out of her carrier when I got home. Granted, she had lost a little bit of weight before I brought her for boarding, but not a noticeable amount. I had already planned on taking her to the vet as soon as I was back in town, but I was never notified during her time at Pet Palace that she was not eating (it was pretty obvious to me that she had not eaten those 4 days for her to be so skinny). I may have come back sooner to pick her up and take her to a vet or requested that someone drive her to a local vet at my expense. She ended up being diagnosed with Feline Infectious Peritonitis, which you may know is a fatal disease in cats. While I have been able to treat her for it, if we had known even a few days earlier, I would have been able to start treating her earlier, and she may not have been hospitalized for three days or needed a blood transfusion just a couple days after picking her up from Pet Palace.\n\nI am not blaming Pet Palace for giving her FIP; this isn't the case at all.

I boarded one of my dogs here a few months ago and all was well.\nI have 2 dogs now & needed boarding while we went out of town for a funeral. I called and was told my adult dog could stay w/our puppy in the same kennel For one price, $27. When I dropped them off the same thing was repeated to me as I was contemplating separating the dogs. The girl assured me they would watch them the first day and if there were issues they would separate them and only charge for 2 kennels on the nights they had to be separated.\nI picked them up on Sunday and was told they did great and were together the whole time. However, I was billed for a separate kennel each night. I asked the girl at the desk about it and she also happened to be the one who checked them in, quoted me $27 per night per kennel, not per dog and said she checked with another employee and confirmed they could share for one price. I asked her to call the owner because I didn't feel like you should write one price and charge another at the end. She called Jenny, the owner, and Jenny told her it was $27 per night, per dog. She  called Jenny back so I could speak to her and explain to her what I was told. Jenny saw it was her employee calling and she answered the phone \"Is she giving you trouble? \" I explained to Jenny who I was and what I was told. She talked over me, would hardly let me speak, told me I was confused and no one there would have ever given me those prices... Even though the girl was sitting right there apologizing for giving me the wrong information. She remembered doing it and still thought today that the price was per kennel and not per dog. She told me another employee also thought that. There were also three other customers in the lobby who heard it. I paid the full price but I won't take my dogs back. I've never seen an owner argue with a customer like she did. She was rude and disrespectful, as well as intimidating to her employees. I think her employees are young and just do what they are told.

Auburn AL) this past weekend (06/14/18-06/17/18) for 3 nights and four days, including doggie day camp. WOULD NOT recommend, 0/10. First, they are so busy and understaffed it seems that they don't even take the time to relay any extra charges or changes in charges, they really want to sneak in those extra ridiculous fees. Second, they did not make time for me when I called for an update and were very short and even hung up on me before I was done. Thirdly and MOST IMPORTANTLY my dog came back to me INJURED. She had two symmetrical injuries on the side of her mouth. That they claim to have no knowledge of. They tried to blame my dog and then tried to say I don't know my own dog. It isn't an injury she could really give herself. They claim to have no knowledge of it or not have noticed it but I took her to veterinarian and they said it would have been bleeding and the bleeding on top of the noticeable swelling injuries on her lips would have been very hard to miss. So either they are lying, or they paid absolutely zero attention or care to her. Now she has to be on antibiotics as well as being in pain because of these people and their negligence. I will never come here again and I suggest to anyone who actually loves their pet, not to come here.\n\n*UPDATE*: The manager at Pet Palace called my personal phone number that I had left as my contact number while my dog was staying there, to complain about the honest review I had left of my personal experience. They did refund me for the extra treat charges that were not displayed visually or verbally (they had charged me to give my dog her own treats that I had provided for her and made no mention of it when I told them). They felt that this small action of doing the right thing meant that everything else was fine. She claimed that I was putting false accusations out there. As mentioned above, a licensed vet had told me that the injury would have been bleeding (on her and other things) and swelling (she has white fur, blood and a swollen lip injury like that would definitely be noticeable if you are actually doing your job taking care of the dogs). When I claimed I could not talk because of work and had to go the manager did not want to take no for an answer and continued to try and argue with me about my review being \"wrong\".

However, I made a reservation in August for an October 31st- November 3rd stay.  (2 months in advance!).  We drove from Montana to Alabama.   When we arrived, our dog was not placed in the the kennel I originally requested.   The facility now was full, and they could not/would not accommodate us.  I spent MANY phone calls trying to get my dog in a better space there.  He was in a kennel without access to an outdoor run, which is what I originally requested & it was not great for my dog.   They did move him on the second day, in the afternoon, to a kennel with a run, only to move him back the next morning to a non-outdoor kennel.  We ended up picking him up on November 2nd instead of the 3rd.  When we paid our bill there was a $20 transfer fee for the kennel with the run!!  Which, in my opinion, was not the right thing to do.  Mind you, it\u2019s NOT about the money,$20 is nothing!  It\u2019s about customer service.  I corresponded with the owner with nothing positive as a result.   Perhaps, she feels we live 2400 miles from there and won\u2019t be a repeat client.   We\u2019ll be back, with our dog to visit family & I will do my research.  I will not board here again!\nI do not board my dog often; next time I do, I will better check out the facility.  Things I will look for are:\n1. A kennel with access to the outside.\n2.  An owner who will own a problem, if one occurs, rather than say one of her employees made a mistake.\n2. An outside play area.  (The play area here was an indoor room, that in my opinion was way to small to accommodate the number of dogs they had in it.  I was able to view it via a camera.  When my dog was in there I counted 11dogs!! AND, you have to pay extra for this, \u201cDay Camp\u201d.  Again not about the $, just charge more and make it available to all & make it a suitable, fun outside area.  People like me who love their dogs, will GLADLY pay for the happiness of their pet.  BTW, the \u201cDay Camp\u201d is not offered on Saturday or Sunday!!!!\nGuess dogs don\u2019t need exercise/socialization\non weekends!

On Thursday, you dropped your cat off to be spayed and requested that she receive all vaccinations recommended for an outdoor cat. We spayed her and gave her a rabies vaccine, feline distemper vaccine, and feline leukemia vaccine. We did not test her for feline leukemia. It is not our office policy to test all adult cats. A feline leukemia test is $50. If you check your invoice, I think you will find that this procedure was not done. We make every effort to ensure that we follow the client's requests to the best of our ability. On Friday, your wife brought in 4 kittens for their first vaccinations and deworming. They each received a thorough physical exam, their first feline distemper vaccine, and a dose of dewormer. A 20% discount was applied to the vaccinations because you have 4 kittens. Your wife paid the entire bill at checkout. Angel was the receptionist that you spoke with on Thursday when you dropped off your cat for surgery as well as who you spoke to on the phone when you called back with concerns over the bill. Angel is one of our lead receptionists and does her very best to ensure that all of our clients are happy and their needs are met. Prior to this visit, you had not been in our office since 2016.

First, they told me that \u201cdue to covid\u201d I would have to place my dog in this little kennel that didn\u2019t even have a solid bottom so I\u2019m sure it was hurting his feet. I then go over to the counter and they proceed to show me a piece of construction paper that has what looks like pieces of a rug glued on with numbers written in sharpie and there were only 4 blade length options. Most other places I\u2019ve been show you what seems to be an endless option for lengths. I pick the one I like the best and tell them. They couldn\u2019t give me a time because they said it depended on how easy the dogs were to groom. The price also went up if the dog was difficult to groom. I leave and get a call around 1ish saying my pup is ready. There was a sign that said they begin to charge after the first 30 minutes I believe after they call. It\u2019s seems like they are doing anything they can to get some money. I show up and my dog is still in the kennel and I go and get him. He practically jumped into my arms, crawling up my chest. I go over to the counter and pay just to get him home. I got home and began looking at him and he was all choppy and messy. There we\u2019re places that looked like they had gotten too close and we\u2019re almost bleeding and places where he was just so choppy. I also noticed when I got in the car THEY DID NOT BATHE HIM!!! Hair was flying everywhere, and come to find out their \u201cbath\u201d is spraying the dog with dog perfume. We went back up there the next day and explained to them who we were and what had happened and the lady was extremely rude and wouldn\u2019t give us ANY of our money back and blamed all of the places where he was skinned up on \u201chair disease\u201d (we take him to the vet regularly, HE DOESN'T HAVE HAIR DISEASE).\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going there again and don\u2019t advise you to take you\u2019re dog there either.

Although I do wish you had posted a TRUE review.   Yes, we do have a cagebank in the lobby so that we. An have no human contact for your safety and ours.  This is what was required for us to reopen after the shut down.   Your baby was immediately taken out as soon as you left and the lobby was empty so that we could enter and taken straight to the tub for his bath.  You were told in advance that we groom them in the order they arrive and thst we'r woukd call you when he was finished.  There were several others that had arrived before you did.  Once your dog was finished, he was placed back into the lobby for you to pick him up and you were immediately called.  When you arrived,  the first words out of your mouth was how good he looked.  You were not charged any thing extra from the base price you were quoted.  You were simply told when quoting a price on the phone that thst was the base price provided he was not extremely matted, have fleas, or behavior thst made it take a lot longer to do the groom.   You  did not come back the next day.   Your grandmother did and told me you woukd not come.   She showed me a couple of small spots that I had no problem fixing while she was there, but all she kept saying was that you needed a refund because you needed the money for your trip.  I smelled the dog and condemned thst he smelled good (she agreed) but I also offered to rebath him.   Yes there was a small red spot  where he probably had a little clipper rash.  I  told her I could make a note not to cut as short there nwxt time because he was probably a bit more sensitive than other dogs.   (Have no idea where the words \"hair disease\" came from.)  Anyway, I was as polite as I could be the whole time.   I offered to fix what you didn't like if the hair cut.   I offered to bathe him again and I also offered a discount on your next groom.   But all your Grandmother kept saying was that you needed a refund because you needed the money for your trip.  And that if I didn't refund your money you woukd be giving me a bag review.  I  spent time grooming your dog and had no problem fixing what you were complaining about.

The workers leave dogs in pee and poop filled kennels for hours before they are cleaned.\nThe dogs don't go outside from 4pm to 7am the next day.\nThey have had 2 cases of kennel cough since spring break, and have still been using the same sponge to clean all of the dog bowls.\nIf your dog is having a health issue while boarding, the workers will not tell you about it if they don't think it's serious. There are dogs who get incredibly sick either from stress or other health problems that result in blood in the vomit and/or stool. The only thing they do is take the dogs food and water away and don't let them outside.\nThe dogs water bowls are only checked at 7am and then again at 4pm. So your dog may be going without water for any number of hours between those times and the workers will ignore it. The bowls are only cleaned once per day, so if your dog is boarding for several days, there's a very good chance that they'll have the same bowl of water over the course of their stay. They have a major rat problem there, so often times there is rat feces in the water bowls.\nThe dogs are left alone all night with the rats, which your dogs could be eating over night, making them very sick and possibly catching diseases.\nThe workers do not have first aid training, so if your dog chokes on the mulch that is outside in the play area, then they are told to \"look up an instructional video\" to help the choking dog.\nThey don't pay attention to what the dogs are doing because they're too busy on their phones to care. So if your dog poops mulch (very bad for his digestive system) then it's because they were eating it from the play area. There are also several dogs who eat poop, so if your dog has that habit, it's probably only getting worse because they think they're allowed to do it while staying there.\nWhen the dogs are playing outside, they are sometimes not given water for several hours due to certain dogs not liking the water hose.\nI have witnessed a coworker giving the wrong dog her medicine. Once that realization was made, still nothing was done about it.\nIf your dog is not good with other dogs, they are set as \"individuals\" where they play by themselves. These dogs are only getting 10 minutes outside to play, and then they get 10 minutes inside to play. They are supposed to have another 10 minutes to play but are usually skipped because the workers want to go home early. So if your dog is boarding over the weekend and they're not good with other dogs, then they're only getting about 20 minutes of outside time every day while the other dogs get over 2 hours.\nThe weekend hours are different, so all of the play groups are shortened and the dogs are left alone for a lot longer than they normally would be.\nTheir medicine is put in pill pockets in their food. If the dog doesn't voluntarily eat the pill pockets, then that dog will not be getting their medicine that day.\nThe dogs only have access to their food for a couple hours a day. So if your dog is a grazer and doesn't eat all of their food at once then they will be eating very little over the course of their stay.\nThe kennels are painted very poorly, paint is always chipping off the walls, usually because dogs are chewing it off.\nWorkers regularly spray dogs in the face with Bitter Apple spray. This spray is supposed to be used for dogs that have problems chewing their fur, and is not meant to be sprayed in the eyes or nose of the dogs, but they are regularly sprayed in the face if they are barking in their kennels.\nIf you request for your dog to be given a bath, they will usually bathe the dogs very early in the day to get it out of the way. Once they're bathed, they are not allowed back outside and their food and water bowls are taken away. So if you dropped your dog off at 8am to be picked up around 5pm, there's a good chance that your dog hasn't been outside or had food or water since about 10am.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519324162478, "text": "Hi Lori, I wanted to reply here as well since I did not hear back from you regarding this same review you left on Facebook.\nI'm truly sorry this is how you felt about working at CDT.\n\nAs one of the owners, and the person responsible for systems management in the locations I am very upset to hear these things.

It is in fact a dog with very little hair and usually takes very little time to bath and groom but thanks for trying to cover yourself. Also, I was told 9am was the absolute earliest I could drop off and that my dog would be one of the first to be seen for the day and that it would not take longer than about an hour. Hence why I was annoyed and frustrated.\n\nHorrible service. The first time I was there was mediocre. This 2nd attempt was beyond frustrating. I made an appointment June 26th and was told they had zero openings until today, July 13th. I tried to set am exact time and was told to bring her in between 9 and 10. I dropped my dog off at 920. Heard nothing from them by 11am and so I went by to check on her since I had immediate plans and didn't have a ton of time to sit and waste. When I showed up to ask about her at 11, I was told although hadn't even begun her. And all I wanted was a bath and nails to be trimmed. Their excuse they had a bunch of other dogs they were trying to finish.

I spoke with a woman on the phone who said they treat the dogs like family, they let them out a lot to play, use the restroom and treat them the way you would at home. Well I thought that they would be in good hands because the people seemed to genuinely care. Even when I dropped off my pups the establishment was clean and the people seemed extremely nice. However, when I picked them up about a week later it absolutely reeked in the lobby. So much so that my mom got nauseas. We also noticed that the dogs were outside and it was a kind of chilly day. One of my dogs is short haired and she doesn\u2019t do well in the cold. It wasn\u2019t a problem until I noticed she wouldnt stop shivering when I picked her up. I don\u2019t believe that the inside of the dog runs had any heaters attached to them. Also, both dogs smelled absolutely horrid and I noticed that their paws were red and they wouldn\u2019t stop licking them. Once I got home I gave the dogs a bath and observed them through the rest of the day until I could get an appointment for my Veternarian on Monday. When I took them to the vet, both dogs have ear infections and have mange on their feet. I know my dogs were healthy before being boarded and I am really upset that they came back with all these problems. It makes me furious at how they were treated. I paid around $300 for my dogs to be taken care of and not have to take them to the vet after and spend $400 there for someone else\u2019s negligence. Maybe they were understaffed that week or someone dropped the ball but I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to go through this. I will not be bringing my pups back.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1549158414121, "text": "Are you sure you are reviewing the right establishment?

Each pet gets time outside to use the bathroom and burn off energy. Our kennels are heated and cooled. When they are inside, they have the proper comfort. When they are outside, they have supervision.\nWe would be happy to hear any other complaints you may have if you\u2019d like to call us during business hours; however, I don\u2019t feel you are reviewing the right place of business. In any situation where a pet has gotten muddy, smells, or even if they have stepped in urine or feces while playing in our play areas, we clean them up before going back inside unless the puppy parents request otherwise. We clean constantly (inside and outside) during the day to ensure normal wet dog smells are kept to a minimum.

Somehow between keeping our dog for 8 hours, charging us 400$ just for bloodwork and X-rays, he failed to notice the 5 pound tumor on our dogs spleen. The tumor caused our dogs spleen to rupture in which we took to another vet in town, who was amazing and their entire staff treated us with the upmost respect and professionalism. They had to do emergency surgery for which our pup didn\u2019t make it. Aside from overcharging us, and missing the key diagnoses for the situation, he was extremely disrespectful and unprofessional to my wife and I. His passive aggressive, sarcastic remarks all of which regarding money, were almost overwhelming. Not to mention that he didn\u2019t even send any meds home with us to help my dog. Neither myself nor anyone I know in our community will be using this vet ever again. He really needs to do some self reflection and learn how to be respectful and professional all the way around.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607195277424, "text": "Mr. Burgamy,\nWe were perplexed by your scathing review because as you left our office on Monday, Nov. 30th you thanked us repeatedly for all we had done and assured Dr. Johnston and the rest of the staff that Cooper would be returning the next day for the free treatment that had been offered. We were even more surprised by the hostile text from your father that was sent to Dr. Johnston after hours. Thankfully, your father was willing to answer our phone calls and understood our position. It has come to my attention that you may have heard a briefing between the vet and staff, which is often much blunter than the conversation between a vet and the client by necessity. Unfortunately, I believe that this misunderstanding may be the source of this perplexing review. Our staff would never speak to a client in the same manner as they do to each other as we understand that clients do not handle these situations on a regular basis. All conversation that has taken place between you and the staff at Pike Animal has been compassionate and courteous up to this point.\nI would like to assure you that our staff does not bring up money unless asked to do so by the client. We did everything in our power to help you and Cooper. I would like to remind you that we did not only offer ICU care for Cooper, which was declined, we also offered 7 days of free out-patient treatment which was also declined. We highly doubt that your other vet offered any free treatment for Cooper.\nIn veterinary medicine, there are many variables. Cooper presented as a 12-year-old Lab who could not walk; therefore, we were searching for hip dysplasia. Dr. Johnston informed you gently that as we ran more tests more health issues would be found due to Cooper\u2019s age and pre-existing health conditions. Once initial diagnostic testing had been run, Dr. Johnston did inform you that Cooper\u2019s prognosis for recovery was poor. Pike Animal Hospital and Dr. Johnston do not make these calls lightly and run every diagnostic test necessary before coming to this kind of conclusion.\nOur heart goes out to you for the loss of your beloved pet. It is unfortunate that you cannot find it in your heart to see things clearly at this time and have chosen to accuse Pike Animal Hospital of any form of neglect or misdiagnoses when so much was offered to you in kindness. We have attempted to reach out and extend our condolences as well as hear your feedback and try to put to rest any miscommunications, however, we have been met with no response. It is regrettable that you misunderstand the situation and this review is all the more disappointing. Each case presented to us is different and as such we must customize treatment accordingly, which we attempted to do for Cooper and would have been able to do better had he returned for further treatment. Please bear in mind that Pike Animal Hospital did everything we could for Cooper. Cooper was a fine dog who the staff here at Pike Animal Hospital, especially Dr. Johnston, grew to love in his short time here. We would like to offer our condolences and hope that you will be grateful for the love and memories Cooper bestowed instead of looking for someone to blame for his loss."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

I lost a Toy Poodle that I was told had pyometra and needed to be spayed immediately. I took her in and she was extremely sick. I went to visit her, and they had her in the boarding runs, surrounded by barking dogs. I asked for her to be moved to a more quiet place, so they moved her to the cat room. A couple of days later, I came to visit her again, and they had her in a \"parvo\" kennel that was being used for storage. She died shortly after that visit.\n\nA couple of years later, I brought a Heeler in because she was throwing up. Same scenario--pyometra. They spayed her and her health continued to decline. After a few days, she was stable enough to come home. When my husband got there to pick her up, Dr Johnston said she \"crashed\" when he took her IV out. A couple of days later, the doctor recommended that we euthanize her.\n\nI came in to pay my $1200 bill and pick up my dog's ashes,  and the doctor didn't even bother to talk to me. The young man at the desk apologized and hugged me. Then he handed me a stained pillowcase with a plastic bag full of ashes. I couldn't even get a list of procedures that they did on my Heeler.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to be able to write this review. Look around the clinic when you go in. There are used needles laying on counters and the place needs to be deep cleaned. The exam rooms are full of junk, so he uses the exam table in the middle, where the public has no business going.\n\nI've been to a lot of vet clinics, and have worked at a couple. This one is sad.  Yes, Dr Johnston is nice, but that only goes so far.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1582316183017, "text": "Hi Robyn, first I would like to say we are so sorry for your loss. Since you have chosen to remain anonymous and this event occurred years ago, I have little recollection of the specific details. I do, however, remember you said you previously worked in vet clinics before. You were shown that my equipment is constantly upgraded and all approved treatment protocols were followed. You must still be grieving to write a scathing one star review so long after the event occurred. My heart goes out to you. I would have met you at the door with your ashes had I known you were here.\nI am also very sorry that you did not have your dogs spayed. That would have prevented the deadly pyometra, not the lack of a \"deep cleaning\" which all but brand new clinics require. To ensure transparency, we do encourage clients to watch us work on their pets in our treatment area. All treatment areas have surgical instruments and needles in them. If a client does not care to watch, they always have the option to wait in the lobby. Since the time of your visit we have an entire new staff. I have shown them your review in an effort to reemphasize the importance of client communication, compassion, cleanliness, and grief management. Sometimes during upgrades to our facility, we regrettably must utilizes all the storage space including the exam room and isolation ward. Sounds like you caught us at a very busy time and we made some mistakes in those areas, but unfortunately those things could not have prevented the tragic outcome. All animals I see get the best care I can provide. Tragically, they do not all survive and I have as much trouble accepting that as you  do.\nI have been practicing for 30 years now. Losing a patient gets hard every year. Online reviews are new to me. I take them all personally and would much rather speak in person. I am very accepting and open to constructive criticism.  As you can tell by the vast majority of my reviews, that my cherished clients are pleased. I know it is impossible to please everyone and save every pet, but I do try my hardest. It breaks my heart to know how you must feel to write this review after a loss so long ago. Again, I am sincerely sorry you are still grieving and I am hurting too.\nMy very best regards."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

Above and beyond, even on her weekend off. Dr Myers will always be straight with you about your pet. Yes, some people don't like this but i would much rather have a doctor, people or animal,  tell me the truth no matter how hard it is to hear. I respect this about her.

They prescribed medicine that I had to pay for, but he developed Kennel cough at their facility.  He\u2019s 8 years old and never had this happen before.  (2) Took my dog in for grooming at 7 am.  Told it would take 3 hours, after not receiving a phone call I followed up at 1pm, only to be told my dog was groomed, except nails.  He would be ready after groomer retuned from lunch.  Why not finish him, nails take 5 mins???  Well then I go pick him up a hour later and he still not ready.  So the person working the front counter goes back and cuts his nails and now he is bleeding from that experience as I take him home.  (3). While I\u2019m waiting at front counter for my dog another gentleman brings his dog in who is barking quite a bit.  I happen to look back at the Counter Rep and catch her look of disgust of having to deal with this dog. (4) I call on Weekend because my dog has ear infection, Doc calls me back after second message and says it will have to wait till Monday.  Gives me remedies I had already looked up, but no option to get medicine after hours.  I brought my dog in Germany and he has lived in and been cared for Vets on Turkey, Tucson Arizona, Chicago, and Alaska.

They treated our cat's chronic and severe UTI and he hasn't had one in 2 years; where as at the other vet we felt like he was not being fully treated and was having unnecessary testing for his diagnosis. In Sept. 2013 we noticed that our dog was not acting like herself and it was after hours, so we took her to the ER vet and they misdiagnosed her with gastritis. We took her to Dr. Price the next day because she had gotten severely worse. Within minutes he diagnosed her with an IMHA, which is a very serious, usually fatal, diagnosis. He sat down with me and explained the disease and treatment course. He stayed with her through the night while she received a blood transfusion, to ensure that she didn't have a reaction to it. He even called me late that night to give me an update. Now nine months later she is her perky self. I would never trust my pets to anybody but Oak View!

A year old border collie mix of some sort, who knows? I did my research looking for a vet and asked my friends who they recommended. Oak View came up multiple times so eventually i decided Oak View would be Max and mine's vet. I could not have been happier with the choice. They helped me take my firsts steps as friend and pet owner and made both of us feel like we were part of the family.\n\nMax didn't have his first seizure until 3 months after i adopted him. Oak View walked me through the different reasons a dog can have a seizure and laid out a plan to help moderate or even eliminate Max's seizures. Had Max's condition been epilepsy or even one of the many normal conditions that can cause seizures i can honestly say Oak View would have been able to help him. Through the empirical method we tried everything to help Max. Unfortunately Max's grand mal seizures persisted and i lost a piece of my friend after each one. Dr. Price and Dr. Robinson admitted that this may be beyond their scope and I respect them all the more for it. I took Max to Neurologists, pathologists, and almost every specialist at Auburn and in between. No one could put a finger on it.\n\nWithin a year my friend was no longer himself. Oak View helped with his final moments and the level of caring and comfort they provided i will never forget. Thank you Oak View. I can never thank you enough for the love and support you gave Max and me.\n\nIf you are debating what Vet to use i highly recommend Oak View.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1455550971601, "text": "Our sympathies on your loss - you worked hard to help him with his seizures and issues.

When I went to go finally pick him up after receiving no word about him there was a woman in the group play area walking away from the dogs, shooing them, and yelling them to get away from her.

We recently purchased one, Ramos, from  Germany.  After about  6 weeks here,  he developed a case of bloat that could have killed him.  With bloat, the stomach actually \"flips over\" and cuts the blood supply off to the stomach, causing a rapid distension, and death if not treated quickly.  Fortunately, Ramos' stomach flipped back without emergency surgery.\n\nNot wanting to go through this again, we researched bloat and found the best \u201ccure\u201d for it is a laparoscopic assisted gastropexy.  In this procedure the dog's stomach is sutured to the abdominal wall. The sutures eventually dissolve but the stomach is held permanently in place by an \"adhesion\" preventing recurrent \"flipping\".  Many animal hospitals do not have a laparoscope or the skill to accomplish this procedure.  Dr. Daniels was able to take care of this surgery and Ramos is 99% normal after five days. He has personally checked on Ramos 4 times on his own time since surgery.\n\nEverything about Drs. Daniels and Clark, and their clinic and team  was strictly professional, yet courteous and friendly.  We can't forget Cassidy, the glue and the center of their clinic.  Exceptional personality and warmth!\n\nIf you are looking for a superior team to take care of your special \u201cfamily member\u201d, consider Dr. Daniels and Clark at Nall Daniels Animal Hospital in Homewood.\n\nNot close enough for you?

The first time I took him for his annual shots and a check up I asked about the small lumps on his body and they said it was nothing. 6 months ago I took him to this office to get a check up because we had some concerns. After paying hundreds of dollars for tests and x-rays, they assured me that there was nothing usual going on with my dog. This week he started getting very sick, and after a trip to a different vet, we found out he had cancer and it was very prolonged and caused other problems like anemia, kidney failure and lesions on his lungs. This kind of progression doesn't happen in 6 months. It happens over years. He had been coming here for years and they never once said anything about the cancer that was all over my dog's body and covering his organs. At this point, he was in too much pain, couldn't eat or drink, and could hardly breathe. The new vet and I decided it was best to put him down so he wouldn't be hurting anymore. After years of coming to the same office they never said anything remotely close to cancer.\n\nThere is nothing I can do for my dog anymore, but there is still something you can do for your's. DO NOT bring your animals to this office. There is no way a cancer this severe goes unnoticed for so long with an office that provides quality care. Find somewhere to take your pets that won't treat them like they treated my dog.

I always thought she enjoyed it as she seemed excited to pull up and be dropped off. At around a year old, I started noticing a lot of staff turnover at the facility. Although I should have taken heed, I did not and my dog continued to attend day care regularly. I began noticing that my dog was very timid of the staff. In particular, she was called by one of the managers/trainers and immediately backed up, tail between her legs, and laid down in a submissive position behind me. This time I took note and my dog never returned to the facility. I still have pre-paid day care days that will go unused. When I inquired about my dog\u2019s reaction, it was explained to me by staff that my dog was regularly kept separate in a kennel in the back during the day. AND, that her \u201ctraining\u201d involved being taken into the yard, on a leash, while other dogs were allowed to approach her and she was given commands to obey. THIS RUINED MY DOG. She has dog aggression issues to this day, largely due to her extreme anxiety which I believe was engrained into her at a developmental stage while at JHH. Please do not take your dog to this facility for daycare.\n\nAlso, please note that most of the favorable reviews were posted at least a year ago. While the more recent reviews question the dogs well-being at the facility.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bbf43e944c7:0xc6636238acb27662"}

I moved to Birmingham a few months ago and did not know a soul. I came for graduate school with my best friend (Oliver) and the center of my world. I shopped around for daycares like my peers do for their human children. I chose Just Happy Hounds because the staff was friendly and I loved how my dog was always playing. He does not spend hours alone in a kennel like he would at home. They have far exceeded my expectation for customer service and outright exceptional care for my puppy. Oliver had a scratched cornea from playing a little hard and required surgery. I was stressed about what to do. I thought I could not take him to daycare while he recovered for surgery. He required extensive medications and needed to watched more closely in the cone of shame. The JHH team took care of Oliver post-op just as well as I would have at home. I never have to worry about my best friend while I am at work/class all day. I know he is being loved and played with as he is at home. I could not be more thankful for such incredible care of Oliver during his time of extra need. As a nurse, I am always caring for everyone else. I have been incredibly thankful to have someone help me out and give me peace of mind. Never bring your baby somewhere else! Sarah and her team are incredible.

Having to wait on them while already late for a flight is not good.\n\nThen, after using them for all that time, the last time I picked up my dog, they informed me that I was not welcomed back. Stella had evidently scratched a door jamb or otherwise did some damage to her room. What kind of place would keep dogs in a pen that can easily be damaged by dogs?\n\nThese folks majorly inconvenienced and insulted me.

At least, because I saw that review, I was not so shocked when they brought her out within less than two minutes and said \u201cshe failed.\u201d The test, as the ranch dude explained, involved taking her into a room, on a leash, where there was already a dog; so she did what I could\u2019ve told you she would do\u2014she barked & cried at the dog.  You definitely have to know what you\u2019re doing if you\u2019re going to introduce dogs on a leash. These guys certainly don\u2019t. When I got there, he just called over the loud speaker \u201cBring Jackson [their test dog] into room [blah, blah, blah];\u201d then he took my dog on a leash all the sudden and in approximately two minutes he came back out saying that my dog just \u201csnapped at the other dog the whole time.\u201d\n\nMy dog definitely barks and cries when on a leash when she sees other dogs\u2014she wants to do what\u2019s natural to her (sniff the other dog\u2019s butt and go play). However, she does well, on or off the leash, meeting other dogs if properly introduced.  I\u2019ve boarded my dog before in several places; she\u2019s had dog sitters and even walkers that come to pick her up with other dogs;  I\u2019ve have always been told how sweet she is with other dogs\u2014those other places probably know more about dog behavior than these guys.  I take my dog to different dog parks regularly and I see myself that she does well with other dogs in her own terms or with me guiding her if needed.\n\nI didn\u2019t really care in the end whether they accepted or not.  It\u2019s their loss in the end. They turned away a perfectly sweet dog and loss hundreds of dollars plus future business. I was looking to board for 11 days while I\u2019ll be in Europe and then again later this summer for a shorter trip.  It\u2019s their loss, not mine.  And if they have no record of my being there\u2014well I did take my intake sheet after they failed my dog so why would you have my info?

Our process is proven to work and is comparable to doggy daycares around the country. The reason we use a leash is to simply get your dog back into the temperament test room. Once your dog gets back there they are simply free to sniff one another.\n\nHowever, your dog did not want to interact and showed extreme signs of separation anxiety. When Jackson attempted to approach she snapped at him. Due to the fact that she was anxious and reacted in an aggressive manner shows that this environment would be too stressful for her.

My dog boards at Camp Scotty in Pelham sometimes and it is awesome. I saw the Dog Ranch Resort website and it looked similar. I visit Fairhope help my Mom who has Parkinson's and at times I need a place to board Bailey while here. There were unfriendly on the phone, and very business-centric, not customer-centric, and certainly not dog lovers. I arrived with my 3 year old Cockapoo, immediately heard someone yelling at an employee to keep the dog behind the line??  Then a woman walked briskly up to us, said I have to take her for the \"temperament test\", took my dog before she was comfortable or acclimated, came back 5 minutes later and said \"Your dog was very frightened of our test dog. Sorry she cannot board here, we have lots of big dogs.\" So I said \"let me get this straight, you immediately (in an unfriendly way) take a young dog away from its owner, walk down the hall, open a door where a large Doberman is waiting and because she gets scared you won't take her?\" I also explained that she has boarded plenty of times and does great. I even offered the phone number of the place she boards. The woman says \"Sir, your dog failed the temperament test.\"  All I can say in summary is that NO person or place that knows ANYTHING about dogs would design THAT as it's temperament test.

Everything you have described seems off. The Dog Ranch Resort is a very dog social environment and it is suited for active social dogs. All of our dogs are out in separate groups socializing with one another and they are supervised by our ranch hands. We do not just throw dogs in a dog run or a crate. Our Temperament Test Dog is a Chocolate Lab and not a Doberman. Everyone who meets him sees how calm, easy going, and sweet he is. The way our temperament test works is we want to make sure that your dog is good with a new person, a new dog, in a new place while the parents are away. Since you will be leaving your dog in our care we want to make sure that they are okay without you. What we look for is any signs of aggression, anxiety, and overall temperament of your dog. If they show any signs of aggression then our facility can not accommodate a dog that could be potentially dangerous to the other dogs. If we see a lot of fear and anxiety we always suggest a trial day to allow your dog to get acclimated to our environment. We want to make sure your dog is as comfortable as possible prior to boarding. It is also our policy that a \"Temp Test\" be done at least 2 days prior to boarding in order to allow for a trial day if necessary. Boarding your dog in a new place is very stressful for a lot of dogs so we try to take all of the necessary precautions to make sure that they aren't too overwhelmed. Before jumping in a pool most people test the water, that is the way our temperament test is designed. Our receptionist are required to treat everyone with respect, integrity, and kindness."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4220c713b92f:0xf176d2d9f950877c"}

We enjoyed all the picture and video updates because it showed what a great time he had at the Petz Carlton. That in turn made our vacation all the more pleasant. Zorro is a shelter dog and staying in a home environment with no cages is what he needs. It's not that other boarding places are bad, it's just that he doesn't feel comfortable being caged up. We could tell that he was way more relaxed with Kya, Lily and all the other dogs around. He got to snuggle on the couch and in the bed just like he would at home. We are so glad that we found Petz Carlton. This was the best decision that we could have made for him, and for the first time in 2 years we have been able to go on a trip guilt free.

I went there because its convenient to my home, but after several months of using them, its obvious they care more about making money than about your pets health!! I was already displeased about being talked down to when I asked Dr. Leonard about getting my dogs monthly flea/tick and heartworm meds from an online vendor. He told me it would only save me a few dollars, blah blah... but, he seemed to fail to realize that, they are MY dollars!! 4 months later, after paying about $45 a month for her meds through him, I finally decided to place my order through 1800petmeds and pay $60 for a 3 month supply.  Of course, the Rx has to be authorized by your vet, who we just saw less than 2 months ago and had an appointment to see again on the 17th for her final round of puppy shots and to make an appointment for her to be spayed in the coming weeks. After a week has passed, 1800petmeds has faxed them for approval 3x and I have called twice. Finally, they called my husband to say it'll be $18.50 to approve her prescription, and she will need a $25 heartworm test first??? Regardless of the fact that she's been under his regular care since the day I got her at 6 weeks old. I am switching vets. Like, today!!!! I will not be extorted by a cheap, condescending vet who cares more about making a profit off the meds than about the health of my dog. Also, at her last visit, I had her nails trimmed, it was going right along fine when he got to the 8th toenail and all of a sudden she yelped so loud and totally freaked out and he couldn't finish.. but, of course, he didn't cut or hurt her.. she just suddenly got upset.. after calmly letting him cut the first 7 nails!  The ONLY thing I can say positive I can really say about this place is there's a very nice lady that works there on Tuesdays, who seems to care about pet owners and helping them save money while caring for their fur babies.  I used to interact with her alot with my previous pup, who I lost tragically in April, but I haven't seen her much since I got the new one. I'm not sure of her name, but it wasn't the vet, or his wife, who treats my dog like she's just any old anonymous dog... didn't even bother to write her name on the folder containing all the shots, treatment info she sent home, it's just a blank card with no \"pet's name\" written in the blank. Same with appointment cards.. to them, she's just any random dog. Convenience isn't everything! Go elsewhere!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a4a55fcad8c93:0xefd9c5ba96e0a61e"}

They lied to my face. The office they referred me to (and who they said they work with all the time) is open 24/7. They kept him the entire weekend without giving me any updates, delayed his surgery, and charged me $900 for the unnecessary boarding.

This review is completely unfair and not honest. Her dog was seen here four months ago. We don't know why she is suddenly writing a review. First, we don't keep pets here just to make money. We did not charge her $900 for boarding. That's just not true. Hospitalization (boarding) was charged for her pet to stay here for two nights at the cost of $108.22, which included administering the pain medication and antibiotics through the weekend. We stayed late to examine, sedate (to eliviate her dogs pain while she was positioned for radiographs), administered intravenous fluids, splinted her leg, and administer pain and antibiotic medications to her dog through the weekend. All treatments that we provided were completed at her request and signature. The charges weren't any different than would have been charged at any other clinic in Birmingham. This client was not our client and she couldn't get in at any other vet in the area late on a Saturday morning just before we closed at noon.\n\nFinally, we could not discharge her pet because he was completely asleep (sedated). It's something that vets just don't do. Bad things can happen when patients aren't kept quiet and still to rest and stabilize while under anesthesia. Also, the liability of someone driving in a hurry down the highway, slamming on their breaks and causing their dog to fly through the air and breaking it's neck is not a smart thing to allow.\n\nAlso, our honest experience had been that the surgical center doesn't see patients for routine fractures on the weekend. They are kept hospitalized at a general hospital or at the ER until Monday. The emergency hospital that is associated with the surgical center IS open 24/7 for emergencies throughout the weekend. That is probably the information that the client is referring to. This wasn't an emergency as he wasn't in shock and we had stabilized him on intravenous fluids. We literally called down there today and the technician told us that a bill for observation through the weekend for a dog with a simple fracture on intravenous fluids, antibiotics and pain medications at the emergency hospital would literally approach $2000.\n\nSo, we saved this client over $1000, saw her dog when nobody else would, stayed late and provided high quality medicine, and did what was best for her dog.\n\nThis review is not honest or accurate and should be removed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

He told me that the heartworm medication I was using was ineffective and I needed to do some research on it online.  I've used it for years per a veterinarian in the family's recommendation.  I still can't find poor reviews about the medication online, for the record.  He also said that he preferred to not use 1800PetMeds because it was too much trouble for him to fax in prescriptions.  I asked him to examine my dog for another concerning issue I had, he said he would, but no call from him or response.  A few minutes later, a girl came out with a credit card machine (no invoice) asking me for $70.

We strive to give our clients and their beloved pets the best experience we can offer. Your sweet baby Mercedes came in on 7/14/20 for a spay, which went perfect. Unfortunately the morning after her surgery, we noticed that she was vomiting a little, which we immediately informed you about. When we spoke with you about the vomiting, our associate suggested treatment, which you approved. The relief veterinarian that was on duty thought a fecal exam (stool sample) would help us to be sure that there were no other issues associated with her vomiting, which may have been miscommunicated (we gladly refunded this nominal fee). With this test we did find that Mercedes had hookworms, which can be associated with vomiting in many pets. We informed you of her results and suggested we deworm her. At that time you declined that service. At pick up the receptionist informed you of all charges before finalizing any payment, which at that time you agreed to with no questions asked or problems. When we spoke on 7/16/20, two days after your sweet baby had her surgical procedure to discuss your overall experience, to our surprise you told us that you were unsatisfied with our services. At that time you stated that when you first called for a price quote you were quoted $129 for the spay and were also told that included an IV catheter. This could not have happened as all of our receptionist have been on staff for quite some time and know that these procedures are not included in the surgery fee. I think what happened (because it happens a lot) is that you truly wanted these important protective measures for Mercedes but it all added up to more than you expected it to be with the treatment for the vomiting and nausea. Also, on the sheet that you filled out with the list of recommended pre-surgical procedures such as blood work and IV catheter, the price is clearly stated next to it. Plus there is a box to check yes or no as to whether you wanted the procedure or not right next to the price. Why would we ask you to chose yes or no if it was already included? We refunded you over $107 (which we didn't have to do) as a gesture of good will and you still remained upset and gave us a negative review. Bottom line is that you chose the added procedures which were performed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

BEWARE!!!\n\nSo to start this off please understand, I am not a medical professional, however I professionally remove and rehabilitate wildlife. I am very experienced in just about all wounds, injury's, illnesses, and human harm caused by domestic and non-domestic animals.\n\nI have recently adopted a Dutch Shepherd, my primary vet for all of my inquires is Mercy Hospital(whom in my experience I would trust with my own life!)\n\nMy dog was a rescue, obviously covered in parasites from previous settings.\n\nI explained the situation to the profession under review( my wife made this appointment due to the ease involving COVID-19, as mercy was booked)\n\nKeep in  mind as a wildlife professional, I have already assessed my dogs illness.\n\nThe main reason for a vet was to acquire a  accurate heart worm test.\nWhen handing over my beloved Dutch shepherd I caught myself telling the vets office about her harmless  Sinus Arrhythmia Heart Rhythm(very common in dogs while sleeping)\n\nLonger story shorter, the vet personally talked to me telling me that my dog has a serious heart murmur, and attempted to sway me into the tests to verify. I already knew with no doubt there is not a heart murmur.\n\nThe doctor himself turned into a upselling salesmen attempting to use sympathy to sway me into purchasing tests. I am also a licensed insurance producer for Alabama so I am very aware of salesmen tactics, and I will say he tried. He tried very hard in his sympathetic approach claiming I need to do it now, its very serious.\n\nI then proceeded to my normal vet at Mercy Hospital for a second opinion. My Vet listened to my dogs heart for an extended period, as well as got another in house vet to listen as well as me, we all concluded there is no murmur and the heart is in great condition, afterword's ran tests to conclude.\n\nThis goes to show, don't try to scam people on sympathy, you never know how educated the other party is in your field.\n\nAlso as a consumer warning always be weary of ratings when choosing a service, especially when life is involved, a huge amount of services either pay for reviews, or pay there employees a commission per 5 star review.\n\nI wouldn't use a dishonest practice such as this, but I also can not say my mentioned vet is your best choice, I only speak from personal experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591036913227, "text": "We unequivocally and absolutely DO NOT upsell unneeded diagnostics at this hospital! We offer and provide medically what is appropriate for each pet. We are sorry that Mr. McAllister did not have the experience at our clinic that he wanted. Due to the accusative and completely unfair nature of his review, we must clear up numerus false assertions that he has made. We have reviewed the chart from his dog's visit with the doctors and staff involved. After discussing, all involved remembered clearly the visit. To say that we use sympathy to perform inappropriate diagnostics is completely inaccurate and unfair.\n\nFirst, he requested (just like any other clinic, our receptionists write down EXACTLY on the chart what the client requests for us to do) to have his dog examined because lately she had been mopey. That was his exact words. The primary request was not to have a heartworm test performed. That was a secondary request.\n\nSecondly, his dog had a heart murmur and wasn't feeling well. That is something very different than a sinus arrhythmia which is completely benign. The further cardiac diagnostics that we offered to fully assess the heart condition in a rescue dog was completely indicated (remember this is a rescue in which the medical history is unknown) and was the best medical practice for this dog. Sometimes diagnostics that are performed come back normal and that is great but it doesn't mean that the diagnostics weren't indicated. All vet hospitals offer tests that commonly come back normal.\n\nBoth of our doctors have been out of vet school 24 and 47 years respectively and are very capable of diagnosing heart problems. They do not offer diagnostics that are not indicated but they do offer the best medical diagnostics and treatments for all pets. Do some pet owners decline to have offered diagnostics performed. Yes, every hospital experience this on a daily basis. Do some murmurs come and go? Yes. Did this happen in this case? Maybe.\n\nAlso, why did the other clinic go ahead and do the further diagnostics if it wasn't indicated?? The answer is that they were indicated! Unbelievable! The diagnostics that we offered were indicated.\n\nSo we were presented with a large breed dog that was approximately 5 years old (which makes it middle aged) and had been RESCUED. Dogs that have been rescued commonly have heartworms because they haven't receive proper care which includes heartworm prevention. If it had heartworms they very well could have and commonly can cause a heart murmur.\n\nBottom line: for someone untrained in the veterinary field that rescues and rehabilitates animals to accuse us of using sympathy and scamming people to increase diagnostics is deplorable. The other clinics in the area know we don't do this just as we know they don't practice this way either. This clinic has been here for over 45 years and the current owner has owned it for the past 15 years. We have a great reputation and thousands of happy clients.\n\nThis review is a good example of LIBEL and is illegal. It should be removed!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

I had brought my dog in several months ago and saw Dr. Oaken and he was very nice and seemed really kind and helpful, I recommended the clinic to my daughter based on my experience with Dr. oaken, but then she got the other vet and didn't understand the difference. One of the ladies at the front desk was very sweet and nice, she was the one having a baby. I was shocked by the other lady, I found out later she was the manager. My neighbor is the one who told me she was the manager and she had had problems too. When I was there she kept putting people on the phone on hold to continue her personal conversations that had nothing to do with the business. She also gossiped the entire time I was there and even gossiped about a customer who just left!!1! That is awful and I couldn't believe someone like that would be manager. My daughter was in tears when she left, she paid over $200 to be made to feel like an awful pet parent.

BYW, please don't tell Sasha she's a c-a-t.  Sasha was adopted from All Creatures 12 yrs ago as a 6 wk old when Dr. Allen held the reins and my son was a lab tech.\n\nWith the arrival of Dr. Hankes (and my son was gone to college), as you can imagine there were questions about the changes coming.  I have been so very pleased with the continuation of great services and getting to know another vet who is not only a well trained physician but truly loves all the pets that come in and wants the very best for them and their guardians.  The big bonus is that Denise (Sr. Lab Tech), who Sasha usually sees - and Sasha's very shy, has won over my baby and even has her choosing to stay with Ms. Denise instead of me after injections and exams some days.  That says A LOT for the caring ways of the team at All Creatures and who they are as crew members/care givers not just employees..\n\nRecently, Sasha had a period of rapid weight loss after getting a kidney issue under control and Dr. Hankes found that she had a growth on her thyroid as well as fluid around her heart causing breathing issues.  She was a very sick little girl.  Dr. Hankes treated her heart and brought it under control and within a period of weeks.  Dr. Hankes, teamed with Dr. Hall, was then able to remove the problematic portion of the thyroid and the growth.  Now 4 wks after surgery, her heart is doing well - she's gaining weight and running round the house like a wild 4 yr old instead of a 12 yr old.  Dr. Hankes and Dr. Hall did a great job with the surgery, the staff let Sasha recouperate in her basket with a blanket from home and are now keeping a tabs on her for a while to make sure her remaining thyroid is functioning properly.  Thanks to their great care, we're looking forward to many more years together.\n\nI have recommended All Creatures to my family, friends and new neighbors who are in need of a vet and have for years and hope you'll see them, too.  I don't know of any Pet Hospital around where you can get the top quality care PLUS the Super Care Givers that are on the team with Dr. Hankes at All Creatures Pet Hospital.

I know that you mentioned Lunita sees lots of people all the time, but a daycare situation can be a very different environment for a dog. She was clearly overwhelmed and nervous from the beginning and even with more time to adjust it was clear that she would not thrive in a group play environment. Our temperament test is designed to not only ensure that a dog does not pose a risk to the rest of the pack but it also helps us determine if this type of daycare/boarding is the best environment for your pup. Just like people, some dogs find different situations more stressful or enjoyable than others.\n\nWhen we determine that a pup might not be a good fit, we generally have a manager call to provide a thorough explanation and offer recommendations. With the additional protocols currently in place to protect our clients and staff, it sometimes it gets a little more hectic and we apologize that you did not feel assured in our assessment.\n\nI am so glad that you found a place to board Lunita!

Even though there are five vets that offer boarding within 5 miles of my house, his facility is the only one I trust.\n\nThe thing I love most about WTD, is the fact that he has someone on site 24/7.  Your dog will never be left unattended or just \u201clocked up\u201d in kennel all day.  They are always playing and socializing with a great amount of supervision during the day, and at night, they have spacious kennels and someone is always staying with them.\n\nAs far as training goes, Adam helped us tremendously.  We have a German Shepherd that was starting to become fear aggressive until Adam worked with her.  He spent hours walking us through the steps to get her back on track and left us with a plan.  It was hard work, but we did everything he said.  Now, three years later, we have the most amazing dog we could have ever hoped for.  Adam is still one of our dog's favorite people in the world, and she gets so excited every time we pull in his parking lot she can barely stand it!\n\nOverall, We Talk Dog is an amazing, clean, organized and well looked after facility, and the training is outstanding.  I think some people want a trainer to come out and \"fix\" their dog for them, but that can't be done.  The owner of the dog must be trained how to train the dog, and no one does this better than Adam and his staff.\nI would recommend We Talk Dog's boarding and training to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d529c0176db:0x3436b80342c70748"}

We called about enrolling our rescue dog in daycare and getting some training to help integrate her into the world. Our message was taken and they never called back. so I figured I would just take her down there and have a talk with these folks. I grabbed her vet papers. I had the day off so I threw on my t-shirt and flip flops since it was a hot summer day and upon arrival we were greeted by poo on the floor of the foyer and were looked up and down by the woman standing there who promptly frowned. She talked with the peson in front of me for a bit longer while studying us with that same frown on her face and after they finished their conversation asked \"May I help you?\". So a little back story on this dog. She is a boston terrier who we are fostering for a local rescue. She came from a puppy mill situation and she has a scar on one eye and at the point of writing this is still pretty malnourished. She is not the prettiest dog in the world but she is sweet and everyone who knows her loves her, Except this person apparently. SO, I told her what we were interested in and the best she would offer up was a piece of paper to sign up that she never actually gave me. She then launched into the fact that we would have to schedule a temperament assessment and that the next available appointment was several weeks out. I told her we had called several weeks ago and no-one called us back. She said that she had seen my message and that their trainers were \"Very busy\" and that they simply could not afford the time to contact me. I explained to her the situation with this dog being a rescue and that being a foster home we were not likely to have her too very long to which she simply stuff the paper back in the manilla envelope from which it came and gave me that tilted head, high pitched, insincere, \"Sorry\". So we left. Precious, our rescue dog, seemed to be a little down about it so I went by our local bagel shop who makes dog treats and picked us both up a little something for the rejection. All in all though, after thinking about it, I would not take any of my dogs to this place. Between the poo on the floor, the bad attitude, and the inability to return a phone call I don't know that I would trust these folks with my family. We had hoped to get this poor little dog some extra socialization and training to help her get along with her permanent home. I guess the search continues.

I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t get to personally meet you or your dog when it came in for these 3 visits. After speaking with my staff asking about Finnley\u2019s experience, they said the dog was very scared and didn\u2019t enjoy playing with a large group of dogs which is very common for dogs who first try daycare if they aren\u2019t used to being around other dogs. The water issue is something common with dogs who are having anxiety or stressing. We provide multiple big gallon buckets filled with fresh water all day and some dogs refuse to drink water if shared by multiple dogs. Unfortunately we can not force a dog to drink water. If there is any kind of injury to a dog during its stay, we will point it out to you at pick up and I know my staff would have seen blood on a white dog. I wish you would have called us when you got home after your last visit with us on 2/11 to tell us about the toenail. I am not denying this happened in our care and Finnley could have broken it on the concrete outside but there was no blood in our area for us to notice this injury. Again, I\u2019m very sorry your dog was experiencing separation anxiety and didn\u2019t enjoy daycare. If you would like to call and personally talk to me, we can figure out a way to make it better and see if Finnley can get over the anxiety to actually enjoy playing in daycare. And yes I do have a lot of college students and graduating high school seniors who work for me part time. They are all responsible and love the dogs so much! I take pride in my staff! Please feel free to reach out to me at 251-375-1600 if you have any concerns.\nHillary Sansone\nOwner"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a6a0729bd0239:0xb3a7eea0c0eae641"}

Yesterday, her amniotic fluid broke at about 1:35 pm. We called you around 5:30 pm to find out if her condition is normal. Your doctor is very sure to tell us not to worry. It will be around 1:30 in the evening. It \u2019s been 12 hours. When I called your doctor again and left a phone number for us, we called for a long time before contacting your doctor, but he still said everything was normal. He only helped to find the contact method of the pet emergency room, but during the two prenatal inspections of iris before, we twice asked you to help us find a contact method for the emergency room. You said that even if there is a problem, you can do it at night Calling you, you also have an emergency room at night, saying that she will have no problems with the second production. Even if there is a problem, you can help me at night. I believe you, because Iris has been here to check with you . But last night when we needed you most, I took a long time to contact you. I also thank you for helping me find the emergency room contact method at the end, but just when we were going to see the emergency department When Iris left us, I always wondered why during the two prenatal check-ups, we asked for an emergency room contact method. You only gave me your outpatient phone number, and I remember I told you that It \u2019s just that Iris can contact the doctor who can help her when the 1% you said needs the doctor \u2019s help. You said you can help her even at night, but when Iris needs the doctor \u2019s help most, where are you , Did you know that because we spent the time to rescue her in the most urgent time, if you can help me find the emergency room contact method, at least Iris still has the hope of survival, and May continue to be with us. Do you know that iris is like our daughter in our hearts? Do you know how helpless we are when we watch iris walk away in front of us? I want to ask you Where is the night emergency? I want to ask if your commitment is really so worth mentioning? Iris just had her two-year-old birthday last month. She is still so young, and the baby in her stomach has a total of 9 lives. Just say that it is gone? ?\n\n(Original)\n\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97iris\u5417\uff1f\u6628\u59291:35pm\u5de6\u53f3\u5979\u7684\u7f8a\u6c34\u7834\u4e86\uff0c\u57285:30pm\u5de6\u53f3\u6211\u4eec\u6253\u7535\u8bdd\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u60f3\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5979\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u533b\u751f\u5f88\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u7528\u62c5\u5fc3\uff0c\u7b49\u5230\u4e86\u665a\u4e0a1:30\u5de6\u53f3\u5df2\u7ecf12\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e86\u5f53\u6211\u518d\u4e00\u6b21\u6253\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\u533b\u751f\u7559\u4e2a\u6211\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\u6211\u4eec\u6253\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u4e45\u624d\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ed6\u8fd8\u662f\u8bf4\u4e00\u5207\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u90a3\u65f6\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u62c5\u5fc3\u7684\u8bf4\u4e86iris\u7684\u72b6\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ed6\u624d\u5e2e\u5fd9\u627e\u5ba0\u7269\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4e4b\u524diris\u7684\u4e24\u6b21\u4ea7\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e24\u6b21\u8981\u6c42\u4f60\u4eec\u5e2e\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u8bf4\u5c31\u7b97\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u665a\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6253\u7535\u8bdd\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u4e5f\u6709\u665a\u4e0a\u6025\u8bca\uff0c\u8bf4\u5979\u662f\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u751f\u4ea7\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684\uff0c\u5c31\u7b97\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u4f60\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u5230\u6211\u5728\u665a\u4e0a\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u76f8\u4fe1\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3airis\u4e00\u76f4\u5230\u5728\u4f60\u4eec\u8fd9\u91cc\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u6628\u665a\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u5374\u82b1\u4e86\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u611f\u8c22\u4f60\u5728\u6700\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5e2e\u6211\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5c31\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u51c6\u5907\u53bb\u770b\u6025\u8bca\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0ciris\u79bb\u5f00\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u60f3\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u4e24\u6b21\u4ea7\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u6c42\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u53ea\u7ed9\u6211\u4f60\u4eec\u95e8\u8bca\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u8bb0\u5f97\u6211\u544a\u8bc9\u4f60\u4eec\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86iris\u5728\u90a3\u4e2a\u4f60\u8bf4\u76841%\u9700\u8981\u533b\u751f\u5e2e\u5fd9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5979\u7684\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u4f60\u8bf4\u4f60\u4eec\u5c31\u7b97\u665a\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u5979\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728iris\u6700\u9700\u8981\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5c31\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u6700\u7d27\u6025\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6211\u4eec\u5374\u628a\u6551\u5979\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u82b1\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u521d\u4f60\u4eec\u80fd\u5e2e\u6211\u627e\u5230\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u8d77\u7801iris\u8fd8\u6709\u8fd8\u6709\u751f\u8fd8\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u966a\u7740\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053iris\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u5fc3\u91cc\u5c31\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5973\u513f\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u7740iris\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u9762\u524d\u8d70\u6389\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u591a\u4e48\u7684\u65e0\u52a9\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u591c\u95f4\u6025\u8bca\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff1f\u6211\u60f3\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u771f\u7684\u90a3\u4e48\u7684\u4e0d\u503c\u4e00\u63d0\u5417\uff1firis\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u624d\u521a\u521a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u4e24\u5c81\u751f\u65e5\uff0c\u5979\u8fd8\u90a3\u4e48\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5979\u809a\u5b50\u7684\u5b9d\u5b9d\u4e00\u51719\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5c31\u8fd9\u6837\u8bf4\u6ca1\u5c31\u6ca1\u4e86\uff1f\uff1f", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqrw1lZDy-F6zdTa1maPazMceFDAxwqT7gPmwE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5cnLAoRvm1zfI4SsQ3oea6mmJVfLImXA6YSWC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQHxQbvSB4xAyHGvmP21FN8NAZUoyTLfAs9sCn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c721ffc03fb:0xd9657e4b494a3bd3"}

During the vet visit the Doctor was on the phone with me the entire time (during COVID) - explained everything including the cost for each test and medication. She answered all of my questions honestly and was great to explain everything. My dog suffers from allergies and previously we were not taken very seriously and told to give large doses of Benadryl even though I explained that does not work for her anymore- it never really did. The most vital part was that she helped me with a treatment plan for my dog. At the end of the visit #1 I was not surprised by the bill- she discussed all that with me as we spoke and #2 I knew the all of the next steps. That was a big deal because where we were before I never had a treatment plan and basically we started over every time we came in. The next day Lucy\u2019s skin was not red, hot, and irritated, she wasn\u2019t chewing on her paws and shaking her head, she wasn\u2019t panting and stressing her and everyone around her out. she was relaxed and calm, and sleeping so peacefully- that hasn\u2019t happened in 8 years for her. The doctor even called me back to go over all of her blood work results. I have never been more impressed with a veterinarian clinic. I am actually a little embarrassed that I continued taking my dogs to the previous vet all these years- had I known the level of service that we were missing and the expertise these doctors offer in comparison to what we had grown accustomed to, I would have moved them many years ago.

Upon returning home, we found that they completely broke one of our dog's back nails. Not just broke, but practically tore it out of the nail bed. It's sitting 90 degrees from where it's supposed to be.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to think this through...if this was the first nail they tried to cut...then of course he acted out the rest of the time. He was hurt!\n\nIf it was the last nail they tried to cut and he had been acting so bad to begin with, why didn't they stop?\n\nAnd...you're telling me you didn't know you hurt him that badly??? How can this happen and you not see it?\n\nToday, he is at another vet who was able to examine him without any sort of sedation. The nail that was injured by Helena Veterinary Clinic will now cost me $200 to fix.\n\nHelena Veterinary Clinic's response to this...it's my fault.

I don't expect anyone to stop everything when something happens to one of my animals but when an animal is very old and becomes short of breath and semi responsive, you'd at least think the vet office that you call would at least sound like they care even if they don't. In a brief phone call, it was obvious that the person who answered was not concerned, sympathetic, or compassionate. Luckily, there is another office that we were able to contact, be seen, and send our sweet angel to Heaven within an hour. She was almost gone when we called your office and were told you could see us in about 2 hours like it was just some routine vet visit.

I had to basically push her into the back, which I thought was maybe because there are about 10 cats right when you walk in the door. When I came to pick her up, she was overjoyed to see me, which is normal, so I paid and left. After getting my dog in the car, she was acting so weird and pitiful. I went back to ask if they had any issues with her and they assured me that she was one of the most behaved doodles they\u2019ve worked with. Sadly, my dog has been acting weird for over a week and I just discovered that the groomer completely butchered her paws. The nails are cut WAY too short (into her flesh) and she has severe razor burn in between the pads of her paws, which she licks at constantly. After reading the reviews, I completely believe that my poor dog was mistreated and I will never bring her near that place again.

He was seen by Dr. Goodwin. I was told he was blocked and had to have a surgery that would basically open up his urethra. So he had the surgery and he came home. He wasn\u2019t getting better. Still in complete pain, losing weight, and straining horribly to use the bathroom. Not only that but he now has a gaping hole in his rear that is exposed to outside air and bacteria and causing infection. We went back to Goodwin in December for them to redo the surgery. Still not successful. At this point he\u2019s being boarded at the Chantilly facility for constant observation. Looking back I\u2019m assuming because they knew they had messed my baby up. So January rolls around and he\u2019s not better. Weight loss, no appetite, and clearly in pain constantly. Dr. Sermon(?) decided to take over and redid the surgery AGAIN.  At this point my cat has been boarded there for over a month and has had THREE SURGERIES. Now I have a cat with constant issues at this point. They said the surgery was effective. WRONG IT WAS NOT. I\u2019ll put a pic in the comments of his rear on the regular due to this complication. He couldn\u2019t even sit down comfortably. He couldn\u2019t walk like a normal cat. And he was constantly crying out in pain and straining. I switched vets at the point and had to spend the next three years of his life at routine visits every 2-3 months to have him sedated and antibiotics and his rear cleaned up. This constant pain eventually took a toll on him. I paid hundreds for prescription food and frequent vet visits and all Goodwin did for me was take a couple grand off my bill and left me with still around a $2k bill for them ruining my cats life. He recently died at only 6 years of age due to his poor quality of life and constant pain and infection caused by this surgery. I\u2019ve investigated this with an attorney and I\u2019m regretful I waited this long as it is outside of the statute of limitations for malpractice or Goodwin would have a lawsuit on their hands. I truly believe they single-handedly ruined my cats life and caused him to be taken from me way too soon.

Prince even threw up soon as he got inside of the car once I picked him up from the groomers. He seemed so out of it yesterday ! Not sure if this place gives dogs anything to sedate them but that should definitely be discussed if so! Especially on an empty stomach!

Dr. Farmer is a wonderful vet and I have used him for years. However recently we saw Dr. Bearden. I cannot recommend her under any circumstances. My dog had an obvious deformation in her leg after an accident. Dr. Bearden put her in a splint, took X-rays and told us she would send them to a surgeon. Each week we went back and the treatment plan/diagnosis/story changed. The staff would tell me something different than she did each time. She never sent the X-rays to a surgeon. 6 weeks this went on. (Shame on me for letting it go on so long) On the last visit the dog was dropped off 7am, at her request, for observation without the splint. She didn\u2019t look at the dog or remove the splint until I called at 1:30 for an update. At 3:30 she claimed the dog only had \u201cliganitis\u201d but was still not putting weight on the leg. When I asked about the \u201cdent\u201d she claimed I had never told her about it. Not true, and it was easy to see on the dog\u2019s leg. She wanted to give the dog back without a splint. I had the staff splint the leg and took the dog to another vet. She had to have a metal plate surgically implanted to fix the damage. Because of Dr Bearden\u2019s poor diagnostic skills, I cannot recommend PC Animal Hospital unless you see Dr. Farmer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888962c804fbec89:0x71ba20c35393e330"}

You have to look at the creditability of the person writing the review. There is not much creditability to either of the two writing these reviews. It was  good for them when they are being helped out and/or getting their way. First I want to thank the employees at Open Gates Pet Resort. Laurie, LaDonna, Cable, Larry, Andrew, Michael, Alie, Leslie and Cheyenne. I am very impressed with the staff at Open Gates Pet Resort. The staff is awesome and I haven't seen anyone else care for animals like the employees at Open Gates Pet Resort. The owner does not put up with employees hollering at your fur babies at all. That gets taken care of immediately and will not have them on her staff. They even take the time out of their day to check on my dogs without asking them to that are not even in the resort. They have taken care of my new born puppies and mother at times when I could not. The groomer Michael is one of the best I have ever seen and cares so much about the animal that he is grooming.  I know there is other places that you could take your pets, but please consider Open Gates Pet Resort for your fur baby needs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d35d7b987f917:0x42bbb4a718b5ba0a"}

They were kind and compassionate and my short experience with them were wonderful. But the lady working the reception...by far the WORST encounter I have ever had.\nI am not one to complain, I do not believe \"the customer is always right\" and I also understand sometimes you just catch people on a bad day, but even on my WORST day I have never treated another person the way this woman treated me.\nLong story short, I took a dog in off the street, she turned out to be pregnant and had a litter of 10 puppies. At six weeks old I vaccinated them and de-wormed them, however one was failing to thrive. She quickly became ill and lethargic. I called to get an appointment to have her be seen. (My regular vet was absolute packed out due to the holiday weekend and suggested I call around to try to be seen as quickly as possible) I booked an appointment with Forrest Vet Clinic for later that day. However, the puppy quickly took a turn for the worst and so I rushed her in to be seen early. I knew enough to know it wasn't parvo (and it wasn't) but the dog was definitely suffering from something serious.\n\nThe receptionist greeted me with absolute contempt. While the dog convulsed and whimpered she stood there arguing that I never told her the dog was sick (of course I did but I was too polite to argue) she then curls her lip and says \"you probably haven't even vaccinated it!\" I explained I did and told her the brand used. She goes off on me. Rolled her eyes, told me I wasn't qualified, lectured me about how I had no clue to be buying some shot from a co-op (they were vet recommended and exceptionally reviewed vaccines by the way) all the mean while the dog is suffering terribly and shes too busy rolling her eyes at me to see anything is done about it.\nHer terrible behavior continues until I feel about as big as an ant and like I am human garbage. You would of thought I was some back yard breeder who brought in a trash bag of starved puppies and dumped them in her cornflakes.\nShe continued to roll her eyes and curl her lip and snarl remarks at me until my sobbing 7 yr old whispers to me \"mommy why is that lady making mean faces to you?\" She announces loudly (but to no one because the place was all but empty) \"that dog could have any contagious thing and we don't want it spreading it around. (understandably but come on, have some discreetness)\nWhen the vet saw the pup he was incredibly kind about it, the tech was very compassionate and concerned for my nearly traumatized child who watched the pup convulse and die.\nWhen it was all over I gathered what little nerves I had left and asked through humiliation and tears what the vet would charge to have the puppies de-wormed again at their office. The receptionist snarled yet again and said \"Well I don't know. Who knows what you've given them and what you haven't and when!\" and huffed at me.\nI was tempted to take the remaining 9 (and exceptionally healthy and thriving pups) and dump them in her lap and ask her to so kindly home and feed and medicate and adopt out a group of rescue mutts in the middle of summer.\nI was doing everything I could to keep this litter out of the humane society and it's been no easy financial or emotional task, but this cruel ladies absolute lack of compassion and decency had be more humiliated and disgusted then I have ever been. I had to pull over on the way home and just cry from the stress and humiliation of the entire experience.\nI am not a breeder, these were rescues, I intend to ask no money for any of these precious puppies, and until I find them safe and loving homes I will be footing the bill for vaccines, food, etc. It's expensive and stressful but I am not some careless human garbage and never should of been spoken to as such.\nSo beware. It's a shame because the rest of the clinic seemed absolutely lovely, but I would crawl through hot sand and razor blades before I ever faced that woman at the desk again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec62749e7f94f:0x636803f2190fa082"}

I asked if there was a charge she said yes 50.00 I said I didn't feel that I should be charged since this happened to my baby on their watch so she said let me ask the vet she came back said no charge I then told her i didn't appreciate the way my kitten was treated that I was going to take her else where.

They still charged us for the day they were closed, but refused to let us pick them up. First red flag. When I picked them up Tuesday I noticed they had a green/yellow discharge coming from their eyes. I took them back to Madison Animal Care Hospital to get them looked at. Turns out they both had eye infections. Best part is they charged me full price for the examinations, tests, and medicine. No discount at all even though the most likely cause was from something they got into while being boarded by the same facility.

I've never had an issue with them, yet I don't know if the owners change or if it's just the staff.\n\nI took my dog in to get an annual procedure. With the Covid19, everything is curbside now. The person came to the door and asked is this all we're doing or did I want to do blood work as well. I asked how much the blood work was and how much the full total was going to be. She estimated around $250. So I signed off and all was good. I had the vet come out and talk to me about my dogs health and it was all good. She told me someone would call me shortly so I could pay the bill over the phone. When they called, they said I owned $480.80. I asked her what happened to the $250 I was quoted? I completely understand an estimate is just that, an estimate. Yet when you're jumping over 100% over it's ridiculous. She told me someone would call me the next day to discuss.\n\nI get a call from Christy who then tries to inform me that I was quoted $250 for the blood work only. She was very condescending and tried to pin this on me. Lucky for me, I keep a dash cam for insurance reasons and was able to send her the video of the whole conversation.\n\nAfter they reviewed she calls me back and the first thing she says is \"You win, we lose. $250 is the total.\" She proceeded to speak in a very condescending manner to me. This wasn't about winning or losing. She then tried to tell me that me recording on public property was illegal with a bit more rude attitude. I wonder how'd she feel to know I also record all my phone calls as well.\n\nI say all this to state that I wouldn't go back her.
