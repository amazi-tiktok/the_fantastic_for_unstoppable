It's truly the BEST BBQ locally.  Everything on the menu is homemade.  They offer everything from the best variety picks of vegetables (sweet potato is the bomb and HUGE, fried okra, corn on the cob, great fried green tomatoes are so yummy, field peas, mashed potatoes, cabbage\u2026 all recommended). The Q stew, i.e.:Brunswick stew is a winner. ALL PORK AND BEEF platters, inside or outside chopped, served with 1 or 2 sides,  French bread or cornbread will fill you up with a to-go box for sure. The ribs fall off the bone,  and I truly recommend the chef salad.  All dressings are homemade. Price per person is about $10-14 for a full meal. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea are outstanding. Don't forget dessert.  The pecan pie and lemon pie are the best around. If you've got the time to wait, their steaks are excellent too. Chopped steak is my favorite, the fried chicken fingers are so crisp and tender. My kids love them. They cater too, and do a very good job. Try a nearby Country's,  you won't be disappointed,  I promise.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81c3f76d90f3:0x34347714fabe9d0f"}

The meat came out just slightly warm and the fries were cold and covered in grease.

To my enthusiasm n surprise, Country's BBQ. I grew up in Columbus, Ga and go back from time to time. And EVERY TIME I do go back 1st place I stop is Country's. I LOVE Columbus Country BBQ and longed for it. About 3pm when we first walked in, the Mgr told us \"to walk over there, grab a menu and seat where ever we wanted\". There was 2 other couples in dining area. The waitress was outstanding!! I don't remember her name, but she was super bubblely. But we were so disappointed with the food. I ordered my usual; pulled pork platter. Husband ordered his usual; 1/2 chicken. Well the pork was drowned in chutney n coleslaw juices, which totally ruined the taste mainly b/c I don't like chutney. I used a numerous amount of napkins to dry up the juice. Husband's chicken looked liked it was cooked the day before or real early that morning. The BBQ sauce was dried and skin was wrinkled up and some spots were burnt. It was very dry. Husband informed waitress and she was very helpful and offered another one, fresher or something else. He ordered another chicken. The 2nd chicken was a more moist but didn't compare to the taste of Country's in Columbus. If Jim is affiliated with this establishment, he would be ashamed. Also, the Mgr had fixed a plate for herself and sat and ate. Not once did she come over to ask about why we sent it back.  How convenient it would've been since we travel through Montgomery often and it's closer than Columbus for us. Needless to say, we won't be coming back or if by some chance we do, we will hope to remember and not order the same thing.......", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1448860779322, "text": "Dear Pamala,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your recent experience at our Zelda Road location.

I am not sure if the staff was just busy at time of order or what.  While calling in the order the person taking the order seemed inpatient. We picked up the order 10 minutes later and noticed there was only one person dining in Country's BBQ, 4 staff in the kitchen and one or two staff in the dining area. About 4 orders were picked up while we waited 10 more minutes (added item to order) for our order. After getting home I realized my 1/2 and 1/2 order of fried pickles and onions was far from being fried.  In fact it was very clear they had gone straight from the container to my take out container. Not cooked what-so-ever. I was soo disappointed. Was really looking forward to trying the side dishes. Now I travel a lot and have been to great BBQ places across the US and outside the US and this is definetly not one of them. Anyone who says Country's BBQ is great has not had good BBQ. Aside from the poorly prepared side dishes the BBQ (chicken and beef) was just okay, definetly not worth mentioning.
