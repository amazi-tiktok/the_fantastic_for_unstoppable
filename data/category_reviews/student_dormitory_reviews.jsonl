The staff was always nice to me and the maintenance team always fixed any problem that I had in a timely manner. However, something changed during my second year here. The gym was often dirty and provided no disinfectant spray or paper towels. I notified the office and they cleaned the gym and provided supplies, but within a couple of weeks the gym was dirty again and out of supplies. As a result, I started going to another gym. On another occasion, I was having recurring noise problems from a neighbor. I contacted the office four times about this issue and they did not do anything about it until I was able to email them a video of how loud the noise was. Lastly, in the middle of my lease, the business started using a new payment system that charges the residents almost $20 as a \u201cservice fee\u201d to simply pay their bill. The worst part about this was that The Beacon did not tell the residents about this new policy. It was up to the residents to figure it out. This second year at the Beacon has left me feeling like the business takes advantage of college students. They brush off the residents and do not take their comfort seriously.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591975459060, "text": "We appreciate your dialogue here, Ashley; thank you for chiming in on how your experience of The Beacon has taken a turn.

Since I\u2019ve started living they\u2019ve had 3 different general managers. Their assistant manager left so they went without one from November until April. This property is completely unorganized. Once one general manager leaves they don\u2019t leave hardly any notes for the new general managaer to work off of. I had a terrible roommate for most of this time. She was breaking the lease and I brought it to their attention and they didn\u2019t want to handle it. The last general manager Angel was awesome. She handled everything exactly how it should be. The new general manager April is amazing also. She handles everything in a timely manner and makes you feel like she cares and actually listens to you. Some of the community assistants are fantastic but others aren\u2019t. Luke is amazing and will treat you with kindness and respect no matter what. He\u2019s always super nice and very willing to do whatever he can do to help you. There is a community assistant who is very rude and isn\u2019t very helpful. This person was nice at first when I got my tour but when this person was handling the issues I would have they would tell me that they would get back to me on a certain day and wouldn\u2019t. I would have to reach back out to this person to get them to fix whatever issue was present. This person also refused to let my stepmother talk to a manager. This person left my stepmother on multiple holds to talk to the manager when this person should\u2019ve let my stepmother (who\u2019s name is on the lease) talk to the manager herself like she asked to. This person also doesn\u2019t really make an effort to listen to you or show that they care in any capacity. Very cold individual and very emotionless. I wouldn\u2019t live at this property ever again unless they cleared out all office staff except for a few individuals like Luke, April, and a couple of other community assistants who\u2019ve actually been helpful and kind. The maintenance staff is impeccable. The 2 men I\u2019ve worked with in the past have been wonderful and awesome. One of the men had to come to my apartment at around 10PM for an emergency and I never felt uncomfortable or wary of him being in my apartment  late because he is super kind, respectful, and will get the job done and do it well! The older man who is on the maintenance crew is also super kind and helpful... he\u2019s never come into my apartment to do any maintenance while I was home but he did when I wasn\u2019t there and he did an amazing job and got my new washer/dryer in super quickly, locked my door back, and didn\u2019t leave a mess!! If you plan on living at this community with someone you know well and won\u2019t have issues with and don\u2019t need to go to the office for anything you will be good but if not I do not reccomend living here. I\u2019m moving in August and I\u2019m disappointed because I like and appreciate so many members of the staff there but a couple of rude employees will ruin your experience especially if you have issues with anything big. But I do have a feeling that April is here to stay and she is a wonderful general manager so you might could get her help instead of a couple of the rude community assistants. Rooms are small. Bathrooms are gross. The lining between the bottom of my bathtub and floor was coming off when I moved in. There was dead bugs in my room when I moved in.

HONESTLY, I would not live here unless it is a last resort. The prices they are asking people to pay, considering the size and age of the apartments here, is absolutely ludicrous. Maintenance is decent, but sometimes the delays result from things the management can't help (i.e. waiting for parts from an outside source, requiring contractors, etc.). Management isn't the best and will absolutely do their best to screw you. (I.E. I renewed for an unfurnished apartment - the new management told me they were going to put furniture of their own in the apartment. I e-mailed and told them that I had signed for an unfurnished apartment so I would not allow any of their furniture into the apartment (because of pets). Amber, the GM, e-mailed and said that nowhere in my lease specified that I had an unfurnished apartment. She said this because she wasn't aware that I had a copy of the lease which clearly displayed an X beside an unfurnished lease.) I sincerely recommend ANYWHERE else to live because the cost and headache of the management just isn't worth it. My water bill for one month was $80, another was $60 and they are still working on reimbursing me. (The water bill is split between the four people, so there is no way we racked up a $320 water bill).  They have a record of losing payments, and charging late fees because management was too lazy to process the payments on time. I implore you not to live here. Their computer lab printer HARDLY ever works, and they've decided to start making residents supply their own paper.

The Beacon doesn't charge the power directly, in every room somebody has to sign up at Alabama Power. Of course, my roommates wanted to split the bill even (which already brought a lot of discussions)... And one roommate just left in the middle of the semester without saying anything and, of course, without paying the electric bill.

If you forget your card, you have to get a lock out key and if the office is closed, you have to call the after hours number and it can take a while for someone to get back to you about a lockout.

Management randomly decided to change all the locks on the bedroom doors and they expected you to come get your new key on their terms. They left one note in the door saying it would be done the next week but didn't tell you what day your apartment was going to be changed and expected you to pick up your key that day during business hours. I work out of town a lot and didn't come home sometimes for a couple days at a time and got home very late sometimes so I didn't even see the notice until the day before this was done. There was no email or phone call (even though they made sure to call/email me at least 4 times a week asking if I wanted to renew my freaking lease.) So I call the office, from out of town, the day the lock is changed and told them that I wouldn't be home before the office closed and tried to see if I could get my key given to my roommate (who works in the office and I've lived with for 6 years, so I trust) or maybe get it put in the mailbox. They wouldn't let me do anything and I left several messages for the manager who refused to call me back. Finally after calling over and over again I get the manager, Amber, on the phone and she tells me that I can call the on call number when I get home that night and pay the $50 fee to get let into my room. So you mean to tell me that I pay $555 to rent this room and because you decided you want to randomly change the locks for no reason I now have to pay $50 more for you to let me in? I don't think so. After arguing with Amber about not paying the fee she finally agreed to let me sign a piece of paper stating that I consented to let her leave my bedroom door unlocked and she would personally do the change so she would make sure to leave it unlocked and I would just have to pick up the new key the next day. I wrote it up and emailed it to her immediately after getting off the phone with her and she confirmed that it was received. Fast forward to later that night, I get home and the damn door is LOCKED.  I also tried to call the parent company to speak with someone higher up about this issue while not being able to get in touch with Amber all day and the receptionist there told me \"she didn't know what I wanted her to do about it, she was getting off in 15 minutes\" then after telling her that she needed to do SOMETHING about it TODAY, she said she would have someone call me and I never heard from anyone from there again, so don't even bother trying to go higher up.

Pet friendly\n\nBad things:\nThe apartments are VERY small, good luck fitting a bed larger than a full in the rooms. Whoever manages this property doesn't care too much about making sure the units are kept up. You can tell each year when they repaint the walls they just paint over the plug plates instead of removing them. As a result you can't use every plug because it'll be too caked in paint for the plug to fit. There is also painting drippings around the border of the room, from them not putting anything down to cover the carpet before painting. This wouldn't be an issue, but the carpets are a brown/black fabric so the white spots stand out like a chocolate sprinkle on vanilla ice cream.The appliances are old. The kitchen is literally stuffed in a corner, and the counter space is awful. If you have a microwave on the counter good luck fitting much else. Pest control, if they even come, must use water when they spray because you will have bugs!!! They'll come from everywhere, the windows, the shower, the sink, wherever! So if you don't like bugs I'd suggest finding another place to live. They recently painted the buildings and claim to have renovated the apartments, this isn't true. All they did was put in new mattresses and living room furniture. The walls are paper thin....so thin I can hear my roommate snoring in the next room. And if you have someone above, forget everyday being peaceful and quiet. They could be walking from the kitchen to their bedroom and it'll sound like a herd of cattle are moving around above you. Not only are the units noisy for lack of insulation, this place is like the party spot. So if you like to spend your nights studying at home, you might as well hang it up here. Someone will always be partying, riding around with loud music, yelling, whatever. But at the same time this can be expected from a lot of living places in a college town.\n\nI lived here very briefly and moved on to somewhere nicer and quieter. I would never live there again, you couldn't pay me to live there again. In all I'd look around for somewhere else to live, and come here only as a last resort.\nHope this helps!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

There's a Tiger Transit stop, and it only takes about 15 minutes to get to class, so it doesn't get much better than that. Other than that, the apartment you'll be living in is nothing like the model they show you. It's pretty much luck of the draw: I got one of the nicer apartments where mostly everything worked, but my boyfriend's apartment had the linoleum coming up in the bathroom and mushrooms growing out of his bathroom wall because of the mold. Management does not care about fixing any damages; in one apartment, the crown molding had been scratched off because of a past resident's dog, but all they did was paint over it. The space you're getting is nice, but be prepared for something to break, and I've had instances where my roommate and I both put in over 5 maintenance requests for just one issue before they came to fix it, and we've even had to call the office. Walls are paper thin, and you can hear your neighbor's conversations through the walls; you can even hear the person above you using the bathroom. The place uses key cards, like a hotel, instead of actual keys, which seems cool at first but eventually, it's a nightmare. You'll lose them, or they'll break, in which case you're charged money for a new one. God forbid the front office is closed because the person who is on call to come and help you usually takes a long time and seems more bothered than anything that you called. As a resident, I've had my car towed before (even though there was a parking permit in my car), and I had to pay $100 to get it back, but the office didn't seem to care. People who don't even live at the complex come here to throw parties or use the pool, and once again, the office doesn't check or care. I've seen bunches of young children in the pool during the summer who I know are not college students living here. Parties are constantly being thrown after hours, but the person on call seems more annoyed that they're being bothered to do their job, so the police usually end up getting called. Amenities are pretty cool, and there are always fun events being had for residents, but the printer in the computer lab, never, EVER works, and even if it does, there are residents who use the computers in the front office to watch movies, listen to loud music, or play games for days on end, and nothing is ever done about it. In short, pros are convenience, price and events for residents, and cons are just about everything else. Your money would be better spent elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

At first glance the facility is well maintained and there was some upgrading going on the last time I was there, thats a positive. The negative I experienced was with  an individual who should have been representing the facility but instead discredited it. As a good father should I was loading my daughters furniture on my trailer to get her moved out of her apartment on 28 Jul 2016. While fastening the cargo down I saw a golf cart pull up behind me and a short round heavy set young man rolled off the cart and started running his mouth about something as he headed into the buildings breezeway. He stopped short of the building and started saying somethingto the effect of \"I bet your having a better day today then you did the other nite\" and\" I'll make sure you dont ever get the chance to,\" l continued with securing the load. I then asked my daughter what was that guy talking about and why was he taunting her. She said he lived above her and it was something that happened 2 or 3 nights earlier, I then asked is he a resident or does he work there, she said both. I told her if it wasnt for her moving out I would file a complaint with the office. It was as if he was trying to start a confrontation but let it be known he was in charge. He came out of the 2nd floor apartment headed towards the golf cart, mumbled something else, but before he could leave another young man standing on a scaffold at the building next to hers. He went back to the cart and left, a minute or so later my daughter and her friend left in her car and was behind them in my truck w/trailer. As I headed out of the complex an Auburn police vehicle was heading in. I stopped and waved the officer to pass in front of me, he waved back and continued. I got on College headed towards I-85 and was pulled over, questioned about making threats against an employee at the complex, told I was identified as the one that made the threats, my truck was identified as the vehicle that was involved, forced to stand outside of my vehicle while another officer went and got Mr Brandon Ray, the accuser, so he could identify me. Well long and longer story shortened, Mr Ray in his haste to re-inflate a situation from 2-3 nites earlier decided to call the police and put a new flame on a already extinguished iincident,  ironically against a wrong person. Not to mention that whatever had happened earlier was taken care of by the authorities nites earlier, the proper authorities !!! The whole thing was sorted out, the police explained the misunderstandings I said I understood however it was totally unnecessary, we shook hands and went our seperate ways. However, in my 90 minutes of unnecessary detainment and somewhat mild harassment I decided that Mr Ray should learn from the error in his ways. It was the \"right thing to do\" to use local law enforcement to handle non conforming residents or guests of residents a few nites earlier for whatever reason. When you represent a multi million dollar apartment complex always be a part of the solution and not the problem. It is the \"right thing to do\" to exercise the authorities to uphold and maintain rules and regulations of the property you work for and represent. It is \"not the right thing to do\" to taunt or badger residents or guests for any reason. It is \"not the right thing to do\" when you attempt to recreate a bad incident so you can change or control the outcome !!! I sincerely hope the owners of this complex takes a hard look at the many many negative things written in the reviews about the management team of the The Beacon. I hope they get proactive and make some necessary changes. I would not recommend spending money here until so. I would also recommend that if Mr Ray is going to continue working for them, he take some courses on professionalism, stay off that golf cart and do some walking. This will allow him to become better at dealing with the people who pay his wages.\nThis was my experience and my opinion.\nThanks, Contributing parent of the class 2017 & 2019", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

Cops rushed into my apartment to arrest the guy for reasons I'm still not aware of. I think some background checks would definitely help.\n\nFinancially, this place was an absolute disaster for me. Firstly, the units are grossly overpriced. Secondly, they charge $18 for any online method to pay rent including e checks which is preposterous. It feels like exploitation of the customer knowing well that people don't use paper checks in this digital age we live in. In the last year, I've paid over $200 in \"convenience fees\". I've personally never seen any institution charge fees for e checks in my life. Plus, there's no way to break your lease.

Dry wall constantly flaked, and my bathroom floor started to separate from the tub and toilet.

At Evolve, move-in resembled a WWE Royal Rumble. Entering the deck on move-in day took two hours. The lines for the elevator were longer than those for Space Mountain, so we had to climb the stairs with our arms full of heavy boxes. I had lived in the dorms at Auburn previously, and they staggered the move-in days. The management at Evolve, however, thought it was a great idea to have 1000 people show up all at once trying to cram their stuff up the building.\n\nThe management is not so much malevolent as they are incompetent. They are unknowledgeable and unprofessional. My work order took over a month to complete because the management ordered the wrong part. The wi-fi is spotty. Heaps of garbage bags accumulate in the hall. After the elevators were overworked during move-in day, the residents compounded the abuse by splattering them with vomit. The whole place just reeks. If you still want to live here, I\u2019d recommend a HAZMAT suit and experience at a bio level 4 lab. But seriously, always carry hand sanitizer and shower twice a day.\n\nAs bad as the management was, some of the tenants tried their very hardest to out-do them.

I feel compelled to write this review to warn present and future renters/parents of the issues with leasing at 160 Ross. My son has rented from 160 Ross and is now in his 4th lease. As noted, the rent rises every year with no new updates inside or out. THIS IS NOT WHY I AM WRITING.\nThis year because the complex did not fully rent out my son is in a 4 bedroom apartment by himself. Some would think this is a great thing but be warned, regardless as to the number of un-rented bedrooms in the unit, the utilities for that unit are the responsibility of whomever is living there. His utility bill for June and July was over$160+/mo total.  He does not use or have access to the other 3 bedrooms. After several discussions the complex agreed to subsidize the other 3 rooms @ $20 each (which is part of their lease agreement). That is helpful but does not cover the full utilities for the apartment unused spaces. Less the subsidy his portion was $80+.  Since he has lived there for 3+ years and in the same room for the last 2+ years he knows what his utility bills averaged.  He has never paid over $30+/mo. I thought these were supposed to be individual leases and a shared utility bill. He has no option other than to sublet (HA! HA! like anyone would be ignorant enough to do this) or pay the higher utility bills for the remainder of his lease. 160 Ross chose not to put anyone in this apartment and instead optioned to fill up other apartments. He did not even know he was not going to have roommates till July of 2019, well past his time to get out of a lease that was signed back in Nov. of 2018.  When you get down to it 160 Ross has decided he was going to be alone in the apartment and would be subject to cover all the utilities over the paltry subsidy. As I said before I would think very carefully about moving yourself or your son/daughter into 160 Ross or any American Campus Facility given the treatment of the residents.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e3e18dd913:0xde2917d43088c354"}

They still need to amend their contract with the towing company so that it does not grant so much  autbority to the towing company, their interpretation  of towable vehicles is bias.\nI am dumbfounded that this company would allow a towing company to enter a permit only garage and tow the cars. According to Auburn Express towing, they have a deal with the complex to tow any car that does not display both the hang tag and decal to their satisfaction. One of the primary reasons students have cars is for their safety. This compromises their safety, because it subjects them to unsafe alternatives when their vehicles are wrongfully towed. I would understand if the complex issued warnings regarding the accurate placement of decals. I wonder what incentives the towing company offers the complex to give them such liberal access to a permit only garage.

And the only good reviews on here are from a month ago and that is because they were giving out free food if you wrote a good review. If you are thinking of living here because it is close to campus and has great amenities, DO NOT LIVE HERE. 160 Ross was made fast and cheap. The walls are thin, you can hear the person above you, below you, and beside you, along with people walking in the halls. If you have a balcony, then good luck because you will hear people partying by the pool until early in the morning. and if you complain, they wont listen unless you tell them every day for a month. the doors to get in building are broken except for two. and the security guards will open the door for ANYONE. and when it is hot outside, the fire alarm will go off daily. It is now the fifth day in a row that the fire alarm has gone off in the morning. The rent amount goes up every month and i now pay 1000 a month. People throw up in the hallways and it is not cleaned up for weeks. Yes, 160 has a pool and gym but so does the Rec Center which is free for students and is way better than the pool and gym at 160. The wifi here will also randomly cut off and wont turn back on for a while. and the study rooms here are a joke! And they wont stop calling you to renew your lease after you have told the you wont renew 5 times. Also dont expect to park on the floor you live on if you get here past 7 pm and if you do park in the parking deck, be cautious because it is a CRASH ZONE! everyone drives fast and you cant see when you are turning the corner. also they forget to call pest control and roaches will appear in your freshly and weekly cleaned kitchen. walking to campus was enjoyable until construction started and now you have to walk on the street. If you call maintenance, dont except them to knock when they come. They have the key so they will walk right in, even if you are in the shower. another problem with privacy is that of you leave your blinds open, you are able to see directly into the whole room even if they are all the way across the courtyard.

You can either trust me and start looking for other places or feel free to read about 160 Ross:\n\n160 Ross puts on a facade that they care about their residents and keeping everything running smoothly but a group of monkeys could run 160 better than the management does currently. You will never speak with a manager, they always send out the young kids to deliver their messages because it's usually is not what you want to hear and they don't have the spine to come out and say it for themselves so they always have others speak on their behalf. And when you call to speak with a manager, they are out of their office and won't be back for a few days. And then they are supposed to be back, they're \"out of the office\" again.\n\nI understand that the employees at 160 can come into the residents rooms if they have a reason but a little bit of notice would be nice. I have been getting out of the shower and had a 160 employee walk into my room without knocking. If they do knock on the front door, it's after they have already unlocked the door and began to open it.\n\nWhen it comes to maintenance, don't expect anything to ever get done. Our living room fan had water leaking through it from the ceiling and they came to take the fan down and fix the leak but they left our fan on the ground outside for about a month before we had to call again to get them to put it back up on the ceiling. And the very next storm, it leaked again and they came, took the fan down and again, it was about 3 weeks before we called to get the fan out back up. Our AC went out for 5 days this summer with extremely minimal help at all. We notified them the morning after our AC went out and we were told they'd come look at it and try to fix it. When they came, they looked at the AC, couldn't figure it out so they told us they were \"troubleshooting\" to fix the issue. This \"troubleshooting went on for 4 days until they finally had an outside vendor fix it. Meanwhile, we were given a portable AC unit to put in our living room. That made the air feel great if you were about two feet away from it. Our room was at 86 degrees at night, and I am really not concerned about us four human residents as I was for the dog we had in our room. And yes, I know it is not a pet friendly place but the dog was allowed to be their as it was an emotional support animal. And 160 was well aware we had the dog in the room. It wasn't until the afternoon before the AC got fixed that they gave each of us window AC units to have until it was fixed.\n\nI have also seen a 160 employee sweep broken glass, bottles (plastic and glass), plastic bags and all sorts of other random trash from the dumpsters into the water drain on multiple occasions. When I said something to him about it, he told me that the drain collected trash and kept it under 160. I told him that it was a water/storm drain but he argued with me that it was for trash and that what he was doing was fine. Eventually I was told I didn't know what I was talking about and to leave him alone, and so I did.\n\nIf you have any questions for them, always get your answers in writing. They will tell you one thing and do they exact opposite, hoping you don't notice or care so having their answers in writing will only help you if you decide to live there.\n\nI understand that this was just my (and partly my roommates) experience with 160 Ross and there very well may be people who have had great experiences with them. For example, the people in the room below us had lived their for 2 years and were resigning again. When I asked why, the main reason was convenience  of already being their, not necessarily the quality of 160.

I would recommend this place. However, every place has its issues. I haven't really had a problem with management and I already knew my roommates before I moved in. The rent is way too high for what you get. Yes it is very nice, but I don't think it is worth almost $700/ month. The rooms could be bigger for one. Prices should be lowered. Parking is the biggest issue for me. It's just awful, partly in due to the location but mostly in due to the layout of the garage. It's nice we have one, but it is WAY too tight. People already can't drive here. Other complaints I have, 160 Ross can't control like how people behave and what they do. Overall, it's a nice place plus they have a lot giveaways.\n\nUpdate: I really wish i would have listened and moved away while i still had the chance. Forget anything i said that was positive about 160 Ross! Please, please, please, listen to the reviews that are real and not hyped up just to win a giveaway, DO NOT MOVE HERE!! To make a long story short, save yourself the heartaches and headaches PLEASE! It\u2019s worse than what you\u2019re reading. Everything from the noise, surprise charges, awful parking, and more!

Not only is the furniture and quality always great in my apartment and my actual bedroom but so are the products they provide like the dishwasher, oven, and fridge. I have had issues with these products; but that is not 160 Ross's fault, it is the manufacturer who made the error and I reported it to the on-site maintenance; I understand they are busy but they came within 24 hours and fixed it.\n\nThe internet is actually way better than I expected. There are two wireless hookups and so if one is slower than you want (usually because of bandwidth issues) then I switch to the other wifi and it is perfectly fine because there's not 600 people on it. There's even a hard-wire hookup if you want even faster internet!\n\nAs far as cost to standard of living ratio I think it is great. Once you calculate all the utilities they pay for and the fact I didn't have to buy furniture to live here and haul it all the way down from home helps as well. Plus the amenities are great and always clean.\n\nThe apartment community rules are completely fair and not strict at all. I understand that they are there for my safety as well as others so I have no problems with the pool not being 24 hours, etc.\n\nNow for the residents. 160 Ross has an amazing staff, and they are always there to help. I have had to call the on-site community assistant (CA) for noise complaints before and they took care of it at 0230 in the morning. It is a place where college students live so there will be noise but if you ask a CA to tell them to quiet down then they will. Also, after some home football games there is some stuff in the hallways like beer cans, and I walk past them and go to my room but when I go back out they are gone. I really get the feeling that the staff cares about the community and their residents.\n\nI know I was rambling on and on but I saw the reviews online and just had to say something.

Our AC broke approximately 15 times during our stay (I think its safe to say it never got fixed even with multiple maintenance requests & visits), so even when only 1 person was living there, we consistently had an utility overage fee. The rent kept going up and the utility allowance kept going down. The hallways are consistently filthy (albeit not always 160's fault).

As a student, wifi is of great importance and this place really just either doesn't care or just doesn't understand? I'm not sure which it is, but the wifi is laughably horrible. I lived here last year and we were constantly told it would get better- fast forward to this year and it's new wifi & ironically worse than the year before. Not only is it IMPOSSIBLE to do schoolwork from your own living space (that you pay an absurd amount for), but I am also from out-of-state and I cannot even FaceTime my parents, because it's \"poor connection\" every single call. I've held my tongue, because the staff has been great to me and there's nothing wrong with the apt aside from this, but I simply cannot take it anymore. This may not seem like a big issue, but once you can't do schoolwork from your home, FaceTime your own family that lives miles away just to see them, or do anything even relatively productive on any electronic device for longer than 5 minutes, you really start to question if $800+/month even makes sense- so if your life involves any sort of technology and you don't live under a rock, this place might not be for you.

If you have a package delivered you have to pick it up during office hours, but the office closes at 5. If you do not pick your package up within a few days, they will send it back. This becomes a problem for those of us who do not get off work until late. You can't have a roommate or friend pick it up for you. The flooring in my kitchen has gaps from where maintenance had to take out our fridge, the fire alarm is going off weekly, there are very few quest spots (which becomes a problem when people visit from out of town), very unsanitary (vomit is left in the hallway for days), very little security (was told there would be cameras on every floor, that was a joke. You walk down concrete hallways without a camera in sight. Oh, did I mention we have gotten letters about needing to keep our doors locked at all times because people are stealing, wouldn't be a problem if there was cameras), and the parking deck is a major hazard (90 degree turns with no mirrors to see if anyone is coming from the other direction). I pay $25 for reserved parking so I can park in one of about 250 spots. My \"reserved parking\" is not a specific spot for me, it is in any of the \"reserved spot.\" This causes me to rarely (twice this year) be able to park on my floor even if there are open spots for non reserved parking. If someone pays for \"reserved parking,\" then they have to park in the \"reserved spots\" or they will be towed. So basically you are just paying to have just as bad of a spot as non-reserved parking. Last year we actually had a spot, but this year it is a complete scam. It would be a fun place to hang out and visit, but it's not so great when you realize what high rent you are paying for such little.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1475240677502, "text": "Hi Tia,\n\nWe value you as a customer and appreciate your feedback.

The AC unit is pretty loud since its in the living room behind some doors which isn't crazy unreasonable since its not on 24/7.
