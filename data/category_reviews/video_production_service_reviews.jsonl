I've seen Nick in action, and final products, but I was speechless when I finally got into our gallery! He captured so much emotion and happiness authentically, with each image providing an excellent reminder of each individual moments of our day. One of my favorite parts of the day was getting a box of polaroids at the end of the night - along with the film shots later. He can take any space/venue and make it look elegant - even our small backyard ceremony! You can choose a photographer who's style you like, or choose a photographer who's style constantly evolves and adapts with each individual wedding. All the weddings Nick has photographed look amazing, but I don't think you fully appreciate the talent until you see yourself captured by it. He's laid-back, focused, and actually a pretty stealthy photographer.

They offer affordable deals/packages, including an option to have the raw footage of your wedding day (who else does that??), and they make awesome teasers and wedding videos, but what especially stood out for me and my husband was the way they conducted themselves throughout the day. I loved having Jennifer and Abbie around as if they were honorary bridesmaids (holding my lipstick in their fanny pack for me, helping me make little decisions like what moments do I want to be wearing my veil, etc.) Some of the videographers even helped unload our cars the morning of. They immediately fall into a close friend role- making sure you're always smiling and/or laughing- they aren't just there to film you. I think that element of what they do is priceless- because the videographers and photographers are who you're gong to spend the most time with on your special day- and it makes a significant difference when those people are kind and fun to be around.

COVID-19 drastically changed the wedding we'd been planning for over a year. We got married on our balcony at home and wanted to livestream the ceremony for our guests. We went into working with DIFP with really only the livestream being a priority for us, and we left with so much more. <3\n\nDustin came into our initial meeting with a wonderful, creative idea to take footage from getting ready and create a mini-video to show the guests tuning in from miles away what our day had looked like. A rapid, same day edit for wedding footage was a huge undertaking for DIFP and they came out with flying colors!\n\nThe mini-video was a huge hit with our friends & family, and made them feel truly connected in the experience even from around the world! Some of our family is saying this was the best wedding they've ever attended, and they did so from their living room! If that doesn't say something about the quality of DIFP, I don't know what will. :)\n\nDIFP even compiled guest videos of good wishes into one long video we got to watch on our wedding night!\n\nNot only was all our footage edited quickly and professionally, both Dustin & Jennifer were a delight to work with. They were with us all day and were so much fun to have around, which mattered a lot to us! (Jennifer even put flowers in my hair & took a ton of photos with my Polaroid camera!)\n\nMy husband and I would recommend DIFP without any reservations.

From the start, the DIFP was excellent in communicating what all information they needed to start with and when they will reach back out closer to the date. Even though they do not require a contract, DIFP were happy to draw one up at my request to ease my mind. Dustin really knows the perfect way to set the tone. He is super outgoing and fun to be around. Dustin and his wife Katie were two of the three-team members that worked our wedding. The team was up at sunrise getting footage of our ceremony venue and shot until our exit around 10 pm (That is hard work and passion for the work). Katie hung out in my bridal suite capturing all the special moments with my girls, while Dustin spent most of the time in the groom\u2019s room getting the guys fired up for the fun day. My husband spoke very highly of Dustin and raved about how much fun they all had with Dustin and the DIFP team. The team was very flexible and professional. When the timeline did not go as planned and the weather began to turn to rain, Dustin and his team were able to shift gears quickly from the original plans to the new plan, helping make the day worry-free. Dustin and his team helped me manage in the hot and humid, rainy, July day while taking bridals and the rest of the photos. Their fun spirited and easy-going attitude was so refreshing when everything seems as if it is not going as planned. DIFP provided us a speedy highlight video that we got while we were still on our honeymoon and the turnaround for our wedding video was quicker than expected. The quality of the video is amazing and I cried while watching it for the first time. Dustin really listened to what I wanted and included what I felt was most important to me. I am so happy I chose DIFP to be a part of our special day. I will recommend DIFP to anyone for weddings, business, and sports. Thank you Dustin, Katie, and everyone else at DIFP! There are no words to express our gratitude! XOXO", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f0e7b5801d5:0xe43f0b2f63472ad8"}

Not only are they professional, personable , and have amazing quality work , they were also the most reasonably priced for everything you get ! They were with me ALL day on my wedding day (around 14 hours ) at no additional cost , they captured the whole sunrise to sunset on my wedding day , and they did awesome drone footage (most other companies charge extra for drones !) They went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and comfortable all day . Jennifer even went as far as helping me take off My heels when they started hurting, getting me water , and helping me keep up with my purse, flowers,ect . I\u2019m pretty sure if I would have needed her to step in as a bridesmaid she would have done it , seriously she\u2019s so sweet ! They all are !

We're sorry that the final results of your scanning order did not meet your expectations.  We pride ourselves on giving each order personal attention and all of the work we do is done in our Birmingham location (in the historic Avondale neighborhood).\nWe recall your order very clearly.  You chose our PROOF quality (700 ppi) for your slide scanning order, which our lowest resolution (and lowest priced).  We also offer ARCHIVE quality scans (1700 ppi) at a slighlty higher cost.  Our scanning service, whether Proof or Archive level, includes the utilization of dust removal software, which can remove superficial debris and blemishes on the scanned images.\nOur technician specifically noted the high concentration of dust on your slides before scanning your slides.  Prior to scanning your order, our tech  attempted to manually clean each of your slides by hand to remove the dust and lint you described.  Unfortunately, dust and lint are often stuck to the film itself and may not be removed except by rewashing or physically wiping the film with a chemical solution.\nWe are generally unwilling to do such aggressive cleaning, out of fear we might damage our clients irreplaceable originals.  More often, if the condition of the originals is so bad that our usual cleaning and post-production are insufficient, we can do restorastion to the scanned images.  This digital retouching is not inexpensive, but for extremely valuable or badly deteriorated images, it is often the best option.\nAgain, we're sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied with our service.  We would welcome the opportunity to regain your confidence."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891a5120593795:0x418ab9e005e5647d"}
