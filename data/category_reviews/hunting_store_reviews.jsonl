When he purchased the bow through a dealer in TN he had after market Flo green strings put on. Last summer he decided to switch back to the original Elite strings. He went into full draw to have them put them on and tune his bow. He has been here several times before purchasing a wide variety of archery goods. The man that put his new strings on did not put serving on the string that comes in contact with his string stop, ruining his strings. My husband put off going back in until hunting season was over not wanting to be with out his bow. He finally made it in and talked to the same guy that put his strings on. He acted like he had never met my husband before and denied doing any such thing claiming that it could not of been him because they are factory strings. My husband explained the situation again and he just brushed him off. He reluctantly put serving on my husbands damaged strings that should have been done the first time only to get home and realize he didn't even adjust back his vudu string stop so his sting was hitting outside of the stop. On top of that everything we have bought there has been overpriced but we justified it because we do prefer to shop local. If you want a fair priced honest place to go. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE.

They take the time to explain what it takes to fire at the range with ease, and have a cushy waiting area to view a quick training video. The whole process was smooth and easy.\n\nThe range safety officers are well on their game. I felt safe the entire time on the range, and they were able to quickly explain the touch screen track interface, and further explaining that safety is a top priority.\n\nI signed on for 30 minutes, and decided to fire my .40 before testing the shotgun. The touch screen interface has me sold on coming back to bullet and barrel. With just a click, the target goes the exact distance. Takes all the guesswork out of the experience.\n\nI fired my pistol, and was pleased with the range itself. The design is new and clean. And with the RSOs keeping an eye on everything, it's a great environment to enjoy your firearms.\n\nI tried the 88, and it performed beautifully. I added some extra cushion due to a shoulder injury. For those that would ask, you can't shoot bird shot here. But you can fire buck shot and slugs. But I'll tell you, it's fun firing a shotgun at this range.\n\nAfterward I wandered around and struck up conversations with some of the staff, and showed me a selection for sale. I was impressed with the inventory, as well as pricing. I see myself buying my next firearm from here.\n\nFor me, it's a bit of a drive from Madison.

This year was absolutely dismal. It started out bad in the messy bathrooms. The floors were covered in trash. Only one of the paper towel dispensers were working, and barely at that, only if you pulled it out in a certain way. It took 3 strangers and myself to find the working dispenser and get paper towels out of it, it was a team effort.\nThere were far less people in the store than previous years, so I'm not sure what their excuse would be. Most of the children's attractions were broken or half working as well. The kids were practically bored to tears. We only stayed for pictures with Santa. Our wait was 2 hours. And by all means it should have been half that time. There really weren't many people in the store. Crafts that were supposed to start at noon didn't begin till around 12:30 and the craft person was stale and thoroughly uninterested in their job. Before when we had come there was quite a bit of interaction and Mrs. Clause even came over to help.\nIt was a total waste of time coming out here. Their restaurant isn't even open anymore. So much for being a kids event. I didn't even make our purchases, and we obviously had lunch elsewhere.

I tried to purchase a flannel/hoodie combo shirt, that was marked on one of the middle store isle racks, for $17.99 as advertised on the sign above the rack ( at 0910 AM). They were marked down from $44.99. I went and did about 15 more minutes of shopping and went to check out (at 0925 AM). At check out the item showed up as $44.99 and I said I would take it over to refund for them to research the price further. The associate at the refund desk stated the price was never $17.99 and there was no sign there showing it was ever that price. My wife walked back there and could you imaging the signs mysteriously vanished from the time I picked up the item at the rack to the time I went to check out. I was made to look like a liar and a cheat by the refund associate and Bass Pro. The only thing they had to say was they had mistakenly left the sales signs up from the weekend and I would have been okay with that. Instead I had to listen to the other refund associate say I was in the right and the signs were removed late but she could not make the other associate listen to her. Funny how they want to thank you for your military service one minute and then make you out to be a liar in front of other customers the next. I will no longer be shopping at the Bass Pro Spanish Fort location and I would suggest that all customers take photos of sales prices on the racks for they are to be susceptible removed at a moments notice to prove the customer is wrong and vendor is in the right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e72ad1fc5:0xde568058c6022035"}

But, I found this store to be really incredible!  The layout was a little overwhelming and felt sprawling. The line to see Santa was unbelievably long, so we took a pass on that. According to my sister, the best time to go for a picture with Santa is on a weeknight, rather than on a Sunday afternoon. Haha The stairway that trails up beside the fish tank was in and of itself a fun attraction. The elevators were even nicely themed to compliment everything. I was really impressed with the entire ecosystem that they have designed. The prices were higher than I would ever want to pay for simple gift ideas, but this just isn't a simple gift kind of place. The gift shop had some yummy options from party mix to crazy flavors of mixed nuts and cotton candy, and even Bacon Hot Chocolate (but even at only $1.49 per pack, I was still afraid to buy and try it). We also ate at the restaurant, which I wrote a review for separately. Great experiences to be had here!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e72ad1fc5:0xde568058c6022035"}

It had been a while since I was last in there.  I have never had an issue before but this time I was there to spend some money.  I went up to look at a  rifle scope that I had been looking at online.  I went upstairs and took the long way to get there.  We were greeted properly walking in so didn't see any reason to think anything else.  We walked through the bows, then walked past the rifle racks to the scopes.  The guys working the counter were working with other customers so I looked around, I found the one I wanted to see.  In that process, I found another that I was interested in I looked up to see the status of the salespeople and they were over on the other side talking to each other and what looked to be looking at a phone behind the counter.  I left the counter went to check on kids who were by the aquarium.  We walked around and I decided I was going to get both of the scopes I found.  I went back and both salespeople were talking to one person.  So while I was waiting, I found a third scope I wanted.  The lady they were talking to left and they went back to the other end of the counter and did what they were doing before.  Now I don't like when a salesperson hovers over me, but I have worked in retail enough to at least let a customer know I am there to help.  I couldn't even get that out of them, so we walked away.  They missed a out a $4K sale.  I am not going to beg for them to help me.  They weren't busy.  The way I see it is they were just busy ignoring me.  Walking to the exit, I found a gear bag for a decent price and decided to buy it.  The man at the cash register was awesome.  If the guys at the gun counter were, Bass Pro would have sold me a lot more than a $12.99 bag.  I will go back again.

So he approached another gentleman sitting at the desk, asked about one of the boats they had outside and about financing, the gentleman\u2019s response was if you dont have a 700 or better they wont finance you and they wont finance anything under $5000.00. Assuming because of how my husband looked that his score was under a 700. So my husband went inside and started looking at kayaks, he was up there for close to an hour and was not approached one time by a sales associate to see if he needed help, at that point he left the store. So not only did you lose a possible sale on a boat you also lost out on the sale of a kayak.
