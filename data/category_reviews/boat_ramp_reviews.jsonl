That would have saved us a wasted 23 mile trip both ways. Waterloo is a beautiful place, but I would rather stay on the free TVA land than at this so-called campground. The campground is actually a trailer park with some spots for camping. We stay in many campgrounds, some better than others, but this is the first time we have driven through a campground and left. I could not even find the camp office to begin with and everybody at the trailer park was staring us down when we drove through.\n\nWhen I couldn't find the office, I called the owner back to tell her we had changed our minds. She did not answer her phone. I got a phone call later on from a different number and it was the owner. I let her know that her park was not what we expected and that we had changed our minds. She got an attitude with me and said, \"Thanks for letting me know. I waited for you for over an hour.\" I then informed her that I had tried to call and she didn't answer. I did not bother to mention that she wasted an hour of my time and the gas that I used to drive to her disappointment of a trailer park that she is trying to pass off as a campground. If you do decide to camp in Waterloo, I would suggest that you turn right on the road before you cross the bridge into town and stay on the TVA land.

Our property is 2 businesses, a small campground on the water with bathhouse, boat launch, fishing dock. The main portion are Lake lots that we lease yearly for vacation sites. It's not unusual for people to turn in the wrong drive; I keep meaning to get new signs but since my husband died in March I've been trying to juggle the whole thing alone. After we spoke, I did see that you had called the office number, which is supposed to be transferred to my cell phone. So I called you at 6:10 and we both missed each other. I apologize for my shortness, I have no excuse for that except that 14 hour days, 7 days a week sometimes gets me overwhelmed.   I'm usually pretty nice.  Our campground is usually not full in the fall, and the weather is perfect for camping.

The young man who is currently serving as camp host was very pleasant and accommodating. However, upon our arrival, it wasn't very clear how to actually check-in. It was mid-afternoon on a Friday and the onsite General Store was closed. There was a sign on the door with a phone number so I called that and we were told to find a site and the camp host would arrive shortly. We stayed in the tent camping section for 3 nights, total cost was $66. Unfortunately the nearest outhouse was quite a walk from our site and we were only about halfway back into the camping area. I've been camping for 34 years and I don't think I have ever had to walk that far to use a bathroom. We had to drive to the bathhouse for showers because it's even farther than the outhouses and it's partway down a 25 mph road without sidewalks. While the bathhouse was pretty clean, the mini trash cans were not emptied the entire time we were there and with only one shower in each of the men/women's bathrooms, we often had to wait in lines with 2 or 3 people ahead of us. There's a great boat launch which was being utilized for a fishing tournament qualifying event the weekend we stayed so there was a ton of trucks/trailers coming and going and when we left in our car for a trip to town, we were blocked into the tent area by trucks lined up to pull their boats out of the water. There are signs posted not to block the road, and I realize how difficult it would be to enforce it, but I would recommend anyone planning to stay to check if similar events might be held and avoid the park at those times. Also, for some strange reason the tent area road was blocked off in several places by rope so we had to kind of forge our own way in some places which concerned me since I don't have a 4-wheel drive vehicle.  I think overall it's a really great campground, we felt isolated from other campers and our site was beautifully situated in the shade on a bluff above Tensaw River. The bugs were kind of bad but that was expected, we were prepared with bug spray. We also kept a smoky fire burning which helped.  I would love to see an outhouse placed in the middle of the tent area since the closest one was at the boat launch. I also recommend adding a map of the grounds to your website. We'd stay here again if there was an outhouse added to the tent area; otherwise, we probably won't come back which sucks because it's really beautiful. We really did enjoy ourselves, though.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611860781770, "text": "Thank you !"}, "gmap_id": "0x889af4bcafb9bedf:0x6ae3d9a300153c16"}
