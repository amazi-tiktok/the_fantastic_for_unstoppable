We had a couple of other estimates from different roofing companies and we chose to go with blue square roofing and construction because of their quality and warranty. Not only did they show up when they said they were going to, they finished our roof in A-day and a 1/2. They would have finished it sooner had it not started sleeting.  The cleanup afterward was nothing like I have ever seen before!!They raked our yard with a magnet. They also picked up every piece of shingle.  Jeremiah is probably one of the most honest hard working businessmen I have ever met in my life.\n\nWe had to have a 20yr old shingle roof removed and a new roof Istalled.\n\nThese guys were friendly, timely and professional.\n\nWhile the roof was being installed if there were any questions regarding what I wanted, the project manager was ON SITE and made sure to come to me immediately.\n\nThey went above and beyond with customer service.If I ever need a roof on any other structure, this is the company that I am going to use hands down.\n\nTHANK YOU!!!\n\nThe price was only $200 more than any other estimate that I had gotten, however, for that extra $200 I also got a warranty that I could not beat anywhere else. I received new flashing instead of using the old flashing (like the other companies said they would do because it wasn't \"necessary\" to change flashing). BULL HOCKEY!!!\n\nThey removed old copper on my bay window and put rain/iceshield over the ENTIRE window, flashed it, rain dripped the WHOLE HOUSE (Because we don't have gutters) AND fresh shingles on the Window!!!\n\nThey installed rain and ice shield around ALL of my dormers. The original roof did not have flashing in the valleys and this company made sure to do it correctly.\nThey removed rotted decking and replaced it with new. What a great company.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3otKjHzWvpabqkhABBTGAO5uh2wYRv6XekAM7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a173eed57100d:0xf6c9a48add8fadcf"}

I'm incredibly disappointed. Our order was managed poorly - the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing - and we're still waiting 6 months later for 3 doors to be installed. From this experience, it's hard to say whether I'd recommend Champion again. I like the product a lot, but I'm very disappointed with the progress of this project.\n\nWe were so pleased with Champion before, that we decided to hire them for 4 new doors around our house. January, they came and measured the doors and told us they would be installing the end of Feb or beginning of March (can't remember exactly). They show up and one of the doors is just right, one door is the *wrong* door, and the other two were not measured or manufactured properly. Ok, mistakes happen, I get it. So they tell me they'll order new doors and get back in a month. It's a busy time or something, right? They tell me the doors won't be ready until May. May rolls around, nothing. I start calling in June and nobody knows what I'm talking about, I have to tell the representative what my problem is and she tells me she'll have to contact the local office, gives me her number, and tells me to call her the following week. I call her the following week and she doesn't answer. I call the HQ and the rep has to take all my information again because my record isn't clear to her. I call the local office, nobody answers. I call HQ again, nobody answers. I finally get a call in JULY that *one* door is ready to be installed. \"One door,\" I ask, \"we are waiting for 3 doors.\" The rep is confused. All he has in his records is one door. I'm contacted by another rep the same day who says she got in contact with the local office, who weren't able to tell her whether the door had even been ordered and, again, I had to remind the rep that we had ordered 2 other doors.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580132983886, "text": "Champion appreciates the feedback in order to improve our customer service.

We feel bad for having them come out so many times to fix a few major (crooked siding on two windows, etc) and many minor (bad caulking in spots, corners not lining up nicely, etc) problems but we want to be able to be happy that Champion did our siding and windows.\nAfter the last set of work is done I may change to higher rate.\n\nOriginal post has been deleted due to all the work that\u2019s been put in recently to make sure the job was done right!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562174107683, "text": "We are sorry you are having issues and would like to speak to you about those issues.

I was told the foam continues to expand and they were going to lunch. Came back and I pointed out same spots. They did fix it. Back on track. Metal around windows was terrible. Text their boss and showed pictures, walked outside to talk to them, just caulked it and send it. Ok, leave and I\u2019ll complain.\nNext installers come to fix metal.

After paying and getting the measurements, it took 2 months for the windows to be installed. During this time there was 0 communication. We tried calling and left several messages with the receptionist, but no one ever returned our call. Finally, we called our sales rep and complained. Suddenly, the windows were ready to be installed.\nThe day of the installation, the company sent two workers who told me they would be finished by 1. The workers showed up an hour after we were told they would. After our old windows were removed, I overheard them talking about how our windows weren\u2019t measured correctly. When I asked what was wrong, they assured me everything was fine. Later, the workers and their boss were screaming at each other over the phone about the correct way to install the windows, the result of which was another working coming to explain the correct way to install and why the windows maybe looked too small. At 4:45, I informed the workers that I had to be somewhere at 5 pm and was already going to be late. They left, and promised to return the next morning at 8 am to finish the installation. The next day my husband stayed home from his job to be there to let them in. At 9:15 they arrived and finished the installation.\n\nThe overall quality of the windows was fine, but I have never dealt with more unprofessional people in my life.

The demonstration was thorough, very well detailed and explained and there was no doubt in my mind or my husband's mind as to what needed to go on our roof!

The display he presented showed us all products and their function and we could \"handle\" the material that went on the roof.  I especially liked the interaction and questions I had and the answers I got.  Our rep for this company was Kyle O'Toole!  Excellent in his presentation of products, all details answered.  Great experience.  Also a big thanks to Keith Burkes who was the supervisor on the job.  The workers did a hard day's labor and the roof was done in one day!  I would highly recommend this company.

I have never seen a crew so large yet so professional in my life and was impressed to say the least. 07h30 they were at the door and by 16h30 we had a beautiful new roof, the site was carefully \"policed\" for stray nails and other detritus and they were gone.  The next day Keith (our PM) came back to make sure things were done as he expected followed by our original \"salesman\" (that term is so inadequate) Kyle coming out the following day to walk the roof and the grounds and write up a final \"punch list\".  And within 24 hours we had been visited once again this time by a small set of the original crew who knocked out the punch list items in under and hour and then were gone again.

Thompson Roofing was professional from start to finish!  Scott came out to inspect the area and provide the estimate.  He did a thorough inspection including providing pictures and video so I could see the issue 1st hand.  It was quite a bit more serious than a couple shingles missing.  He also patched the roof so it would not leak anymore!  He followed up with a detailed estimate spelling out exactly what they would be doing!  I accepted the estimate and a few days later two great young men - Sammy and Jamie - came out and took care of the job!  From what I could see they did an excellent job  I figured I would receive the bill and pay, and I would be happy with that.  It was much better than that.  I received a follow-up call to see if I was satisfied.  On top of that Scott called and scheduled a walkthrough.

Finally, after it was all done Kyle came back for a post inspection.

The install went smoothly, a little over a month after buying. We had metal windows and the guys took the time to cut them out by hand and ensure our new windows went in seamlessly.

I first met with Craig Blair on April.  He gave me a quote that same day.  He was very patient and was definitely not in a hurry to leave, even though it was late in the day.  He answered all of my questions.  After I thought about it for a while he came back another afternoon to answer more questions and show the demo window unit to my wife.  Again, very patient and in no hurry to be anywhere.\n\nMade down payment in April.  He said they would install in early June.  That is exactly what happened.  The install took only three days.  They started on a Wednesday and finished on a Friday.  The install crew consisted of three guys.  They were extremely polite and cleaned up their mess each day.\n\nThere was only one major issue.  There were streaks and smudges on every window.  It looked like some kind of sealant that was not cleaned off during the manufacturing process.  I met with the lead installer on Friday morning and pointed this out to him and asked that he clean the windows.  He was very condescending and obviously did not want to clean the windows.  He said he would but I knew he would not.  I went back to work (my wife was home but said she would not enforce the window cleaning)\n\nThe project was finished when I got home Friday afternoon.  The windows looked great but . . . You guessed it.  There were still streaks and smudges on all the windows.  Not wanting to be a pain, I tried cleaning the windows myself.  The sealant was very difficult to remove.  It would not come off with glass cleaner alone.  I decided this should definitely be Blair\u2019s responsibility.\n\nI asked for a meeting with Criag Blair.  We met the following week.  He was very polite and patient.  He agreed to have the windows cleaned and address a few other minor issues.\n\nIt took a while, and to be fair, I was out of town for a week but we finally coordinated on having the windows cleaned.  The crew that did the installation came back out.  They came while I was at work.  My wife was home but declined to be the inspector.  They finished cleaning about 3 PM.  They waited for me to get home at 4:30.  We walked around and inspected all 26 windows.  There were a few touch ups but for the most part they did a good job.\n\nIn summary, I was very pleased and satisfied with the entire process.  I will definitely use Blair Remodeling in for any future projects.  Craig Blair is the best.  I totally trust him and I know that he will do whatever is necessary to make sure I am satisfied.

The roofer walked the entire roof looking for nails that were backing out (not just in the area of the water stains below, but the whole roof), removing all that he found, sealing the hole and making sure the roof shingle lay flat. Two days after the repairs we had a lot of rain, and no water leaks inside the house.\n\nOnce again, Pickett Construction has made my wife and I very happy, and I will not hesitate to call them in the future.

{"user_id": "108852040032783306603", "name": "Tim Calhoun", "time": 1396761930047, "rating": 4.0, "text": "Pricing:\nWe contracted with Pickett to complete some work on our house to prepare it for sale. We were looking for some typical wood rot to be replaced and exterior paint. We also requested an interior paint quote. I think the quote was a bit high for the exterior work, but not so bad that I didn't go with their services. The quote for the interior painting was outrageous, so we opted for another painter. The other painter's quote was nearly $3000 less than the quote from Pickett. We were also having some plywood put in the ceiling of the carport, because the builder used interior drywall in our neighborhood. Pickett gave us a \"complimentary upgrade\" to beadboard instead of plain plywood. This really added a nice touch to the carport ceiling, and was an appreciated upgrade. They only requested 1/2-down to start the work, which we felt was certainly reasonable. They also honored their coupon they regularly have (often in the Alabaster Newsletter, or ValPack). We printed ours from the ValPack website.\n\nWorkmanship:\nThe quality of the exterior work was pretty good. There were a few spots where the painting got a bit \"sloppy,\" but was overall good work. The beadboard in the carport made a great upgrade to our carport, and added a touch of \"class\" to an otherwise mundane area of the house. Unfortunately, due to our unusually cold winter, the holidays, and several bouts with rain, our work was regularly delayed. It took a bit longer than expected to complete, but didn't delay our schedule of listing the house. The little interaction I had with the crew was polite and courteous, though at times the project manager came across as mildly arrogant. Communicating with the PM via email was the best medium, although he sometimes took a bit longer than expected to return messages.\n\nPost Work Follow-up:\nAgain, the delays in returning messages made for a challenge in clearing our post-work \"punch list,\" but this was also around the holidays, so we conceded a bit.  Had there been more clear communication about workday expectations (e.g. workers will/will not be onsite today) this would have made for better overall feeling about the length of the job.\nDuring our home buyer's inspection, they found more wood rot that was inadvertently overlooked by the crew. While I don't expect the painters to look over every square inch of the house (heck, neither did I!), it ended up being a significant portion of the chimney that had rotted out the edge of our masonite siding. One would expect that at least part of that might have been discovered and either repaired or at least alerted me to the potential change in an estimate so it could be repaired. When we approached our PM about correcting it, he gave us a price quote. After paying over $6000 for the original work, this was certainly unexpected, especially with their \"1 year warranty.\" I spoke with Josh, the owner's son who is also in management with the company. He immediately started working with me to find a reasonable solution. I ended up having to pay a bit more, but we did come to an acceptable compromise on the final cost of the supplemental work. In the end, Josh personally stopped by the house to deliver the revised agreement and took pictures of the missed work. It turned out that the rot was more severe than even he expected. He opted to continue to honor that revised estimate and didn't charge anymore. Josh really worked hard to make a relatively displeasing situation wok out well in the end. Josh was absolutely committed to service and ensuring my end satisfaction. He even reached out after the supplemental work was completed to check in on my satisfaction, and knowing there was a bit of a sour taste, still wanted this Google Review. Josh knows what it takes to listen to customer concerns and immediately find a reasonable solution that works in the best interest of all parties. Had it not been for Josh's actions, my 4-star rating would have been a high 2-star, or low 3-star.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}

The Superior Roofing team replaced the shingles on our steep, tree-damaged roof, removed damaged gutters, installed new gutters with a perfect color match to our existing fascia trim, and expertly repaired our tree-damaged deck railings and steps.  We are very pleased with the results of all this multi-trade work and have received quite a few neighborhood compliments on the results.\nA late spring storm with heavy rains and high winds had caused a huge, old poplar tree to fall on our house.  Once our insurance company had completed their initial estimate of repairing the damage, we made our list of potential service providers and included Superior Roofing.  The estimator returned our call promptly and set up a convenient appointment to come by our house to assess our situation.  After walking the site, he explained his estimate while talking around the kitchen table with us and provided a professional package of insurance and business license documentation.  We had previously talked with several other very reputable and capable companies, but only a few could manage all the tasks in a single installation window and even fewer were willing to stay within our preferred guidelines for deck repair rather than replacement.  The Superior Roofing estimator described how the team could do our preferred repairs and created a window of opportunity in the work schedule.  After weighing a lot of factors, we decided to do business with Superior Roofing based on the estimator\u2019s straight-forward and professional manner, experience working with insurance claims, personal referrals from other trusted service providers we had used, the company\u2019s excellent ratings on several web sites and with the Better Business Bureau (A+ rating), and the interesting completed projects described on the company\u2019s web site.  The estimator personally showed up on site while the work was being done, made sure we were satisfied with the work, and followed up promptly with the close-out paperwork and insurance coordination.  As with so many home repair projects, some field changes to work already quoted were requested by us or suggested by the project lead on site.  The estimator and the project lead communicated promptly with us, gave us their candid assessments, provided cost deltas both plus and minus, and decisions that worked for all parties were made without delaying the work schedule.

{"user_id": "103807360235985118981", "name": "C. Gatlin", "time": 1578617837641, "rating": 1.0, "text": "If I could give Window World of Dothan, AL a -100, I would.  I would NEVER refer them to anyone nor EVER use them again.  They are the absolute worst in customer service.  The salesperson is the face of the company and that\u2019s about as good as it gets.   It is difficult to contact them by phone and when you do no one is ever around who has any answers.  The receptionist or answering service must always get back to you, and usually never the same day.  I don\u2019t know the criteria for Window World being ranked as the #1 replacement company in America, but it can\u2019t be based on any contributions from Window World of Dothan, AL, at least not for doors and shutters.\n\nWe contracted with Window World of Dothan, AL on 1 Oct 2019 for 10 sets of outdoor shutters and a front door.  The install should have only taken a day. The install began on 16 Nov in the late afternoon and still has not been completed as of today, 9 Jan 2020.  The individual sent to install the shutters and door obviously didn\u2019t care about the job because the quality of the installs were substandard.  We tried to give him space and let him do his job, but that was a mistake because when we looked closer at the tall shutters they were installed with only 4 pegs instead of 6 (industry standard) and did not place the pegs uniformly (symmetrically) into the mortar, some directly into the brick.  When asked if 4 pegs was a Window World standard, he said it didn't matter.  We also asked if he filled the old holes and he stated \"some\",  which we knew meant \"none\". His defense was to say there were lots of holes in our house.\n\nThe installer completed the haphazard shutter install and departed because it started to drizzle and he didn't want the caulking to get wet. He was supposed to return the next day (Friday) to install the door.  He sent a text on Friday to say he was still on a job in GA and wouldn't arrive until the afternoon. We responded that we didn't like afternoon appointments because he would be rushing the door install the same way he rushed the shutter install and make more mistakes.  He agreed to return the following day in the morning.  Meanwhile, my wife attempted to call Window World, Dothan several times to ask about the standards for shutter installation but no one ever called her back.\n\nAs he was installing the door on Saturday, we let him know the door was not square in the frame.  His ongoing response was to tell us that our house was the reason the door wasn't straight. Once the install was complete we continued to let him know we were not satisfied with the way the door looked in the frame.  As he prepared to install the storm door, he realized the frame had to be shimmed and stated he would return on Sunday to finish the job.  When he returned at 9am we told him that the thresh hold needed to be adjusted more because we could see car lights under the door and feel the cold air. He appeared a little agitated. He became more agitated when my wife asked \"hypothetically\" what would happen if we wanted to discuss the possibility of getting another door. He then said he could fix the door.  My wife asked him if that was the case why he hadn't fixed it in the first place.  He proceeded to tell my wife that she complained about the shutters and every little thing about the door. He then stopped what he was doing and left the storm door uninstalled.  He told her that day was his last day at Window World so he didn't care if we complained.\n\nMy wife called Window World the following Monday  and asked to speak to the owner.  Instead of being contacted by the owner, the salesman was sent for damage control.  He stated he would have the shutters reordered and expedited.  Another installer was sent to correct the door install.  He made some additional adjustments that helped but was still not the quality of install we expected.  It is currently 9 Jan 2020 and we have not heard from Window World about the shutters or the fact that we are extremely DISSATISFIED customers.  Their lack of care, concern, and communication speaks volumes about the organization.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578694241397, "text": "Mr. Gatlin, we appreciate the time spent sharing this information with us.

On week #6 half the bill was charged with interest with NO work being completed and no communication on when it would be completed/started. When this was addressed with Charlie (owner) it was ignored and not resolved. There was no mention of us being charged BEFORE work was completed. We called the Champion local office twice with no response. On the 3rd time we called corporate and Damon (installation manager) quickly returned my call.\nThe installation guys were 40 minutes late from appointment time, again with NO communication. I had to call to find out they needed to stop and get caulk on the way to my house. I would think they would have been prepared with the proper equipment prior to the customer's appointment time.\nThe installers were polite and professional, however I brought up some quality issues during the installation process that did not get properly taken care of until they said they were leaving causing them to stay longer and redo some of their work. (Gap in the J-molding, they wanted to caulk the gap, not fix it) Corporate called me wanted me to sign a form stating the job was done even though the installers were still here finishing the job.  When I mentioned the issues regarding some other problems (window & screen defects) Damon called me to come out to resolve the issues.\nBottom Line: Customer service and apologies goes a long way.

We just wanted a person to come by and talk to us about a new sunroom. This phone system service (meaning=the \"trained\" people manning the phones) is highly disorganized! Perhaps it is because of the virus? Leaving messages or even setting up appointments to meet with a representative and that representative never showed is very disheartening. (0 stars for that set-up-an-appt craziness.) Corporate office? You need to get that fixed! Perhaps employ another phone service to answer your toll calls? \ud83e\udd14\n\nFINALLY...after months of calls...we got our Champion reps at our home.\n\nMatt and Charles came to us in East Limestone from the Huntsville office which is by the airport. Having already had sales presentations by two competitors, we knew what to expect in their presentation. They immediately realized we were most interested in quality and price for our new sunroom.\n\nMatt was thorough in showing us the construction of their unique products. He even had samples to demonstrate the sunroom's best attributes.\n\nWe were surprised at the price. Matt was precise and clear on it. One contract, too, one price. Never additional hidden fees. Perhaps we contacted them at the correct time since it is December after all. \ud83d\ude01 Good price for the quality...the sunroom we chose actually can be added to our home square footage.\n\nCharles invited us to come by their showroom. I suggest everyone do this! Seeing several sunrooms already set up truly helps in your decision process versus just seeing magazine quality sunrooms in their catalogs.\n\nCharles even brought us to the back of where products are custom made for every sunroom. These are not kits. We went for the 6in depth walls. Seeing the sun rooms in the office and showroom also convinced us to go ahead with additional products. Charles was not pushy at all. We made these decisions on our own.\n\nBoth Matt & Charles also gave us their personal cell phone numbers and we have called them several times. They have always been available -immediately-. We appreciate this courtesy! (Those 5 \u2b50's for them.)\n\nHaving read 1-\ud83c\udf1f reviews from a year ago...yikes! We decided to see for ourselves and really tested our sales team.

Corey's temper when we involved Rob in communicating our concerns was completely unprofessional. Rob offered to give us a gift card for dinner as a compensation for the trouble we experienced (what a joke!). The national customer service manager threatened me and swore at me when I insisted Champion make the right the issues we experienced.\n\nThis company is full of dishonest, unprofessional, and unexperienced people charging high prices for a product of average quality.\n\nUPDATE IN RESPONSE TO CHAMPION'S RESPONSE: If nothing else, please take Champion's sarcastic response to my feedback as a token of their lack of professionalism.

We have a home that has 32 windows. These windows were from the original build back in 1999. Over time these windows failed, broke internal components, were loose, didn't stay up and let so much air in between them; it really hurt our HVAC bills. We decided to look at new windows. We went through the hoops and ringers with various window companies in the area and the big box stores. The price ranges were all over the place and the functions, options, features and price points were the driving factors in this big home reno purchase. We called Champion (CW going forward) and had our salesman Whit come out and give his sales pitch. He did a great pitch and was at our house for 4 plus hours. Going over every detail and question we had. He was not afraid to say \"I don't know, but I will find out\" and called ahead to ask with us on his speakerphone right in front of him. He never stepped out to his truck to ask; he just did it right in front of us. We wanted an answer and he went and got one. Good bad or indifferent there was no empty promises or sugar coated answers. We were explained all the finance options and the promo they were having during our consultation. We beat him up pretty good with our wants and needs for the windows. After that was done, Cory then came out a few days later and walked me through the measurement process; again answering my rhetorical questions and others I missed with Whit. He took meticulous measurements of ALL my windows and explained what my casements would be and how they would sit in the frame. I walked through the house with and he asked questions to me about each room as he measured and took detailed notes. We discussed the order that was first taken to verify everything was right...the first time. He explained the install and what was done with that process from top to bottom. As well as what to expect with financing options again. Making this as streamlined as possible. He explained our order, what timeline for delivery was and the timeline of the install process once the windows arrived from the factory. Once our windows arrived in Huntsville, we were given a few choices on the install. We picked the date that worked on our schedule and a timeframe that made sense for the install. Once again, were explained the who what when were and how on the install team. The install team was on time the first day with everything ready and planned out so they could hit the ground running. Jimmy Mashburn and Brandon Clark were the install team and they were incredible. I have OCD about fit and finish and so does this install team. Jimmy talked with my wife so she would get the understanding of the install and what she could expect. He didn't make her feel silly for asking and was very professional with each question. We, of course stayed out of the way, but if either side had a question about a window, my wife and or Jimmy/Brandon made sure both parties were on the same page. They took their time and set everything right the first time. We didn't care how long it took and they were very meticulous and detail driven on each window. They were not in any hurry to just set 'em and forget 'em. It was done right the first time. I'm no installer but I'm a homeowner that bought 32 windows so I was wanting to find something wrong or find a shortcut that I saw...NOPE! I couldn't find anything that I felt was incorrect or not done in a make sense manner. Everything was top notch work. All my old windows were removed and stacked out of the way. Drop cloths were placed inside on each opening to make sure the removal was as clean and clutter free. All of the windows were set correctly, openings were cleaned from past dirt and debris. Professional 100%!! I felt that my money was going to the right company for our home. These are big decisions to make when getting new windows and the value of the CW product met our families need. We are truly very happy with our windows and would recommend CW to anyone!! We are very happy we went with Champion!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572873361192, "text": "Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this great review.

They never came out to check the gutters.  They said that if they  were stopped up that they would charge us for coming out.  If gutters stop up after only a few days, there's got to be a problem with the gutters. (not enough slope for the rain to run out, not enough downspouts to handle the amount of rain, etc...)  There are no leaves falling in early summer so what can stop them up?  While talking to my husband on the phone, the owner even said my husband acted like a D---.  Now how professional is that?
