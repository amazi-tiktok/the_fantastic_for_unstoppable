They were the only one of the five companies that realized there was not a stud behind the tile where the door was to be installed and actually recommended a solution that ended up saving us money (though they also made sure I knew they were capable of going with the more expensive solution if we decided to go that route).\n\nUsing the information that they provided, I was able to go back and get a slightly cheaper quote from one of the other companies. Despite that, I went with Madison Glass because I felt I could trust Wade and Kevin to do the job right. I'm glad I did.\n\nWe had a small hiccup with the manufacturer on the first replacement window and shower door that came in, but Wade and Kevin set us up for the mean time and made sure to prioritize getting back out as soon as the replacement glass came in.\n\nThe shower looks great, the service was excellent, they let us know what to expect and then kept us informed throughout the process, and we ended up spending less than what we expected.

I had gotten a quote from a \u201cwindow\u201d company and they said the whole window plus the transom above it would have to be replaced and their cost was over 1700.00.  I called another glass company and they have yet to call me back to even come out and look at replacing the glass only. I called  Huntsville Glass and I believe they came out within 2 days to measure and give me a quote. It was under 600.00. After I gave them the go ahead to order the replacement glass I was told it would take 2-3 weeks and that was fine with me but they came in at least a week sooner and they installed them within two days of calling me to say they were in!! John and James arrived right on time and were finished quickly and left behind no mess.  The even answered my questions and explained the process to me patiently.  I will definitely use them again!  I appreciate their exemplary customer service!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1579007760884, "text": "Meike, we are so glad to have been able to provide you with a great experience and are thankful that you took the time to provide an in depth review.

When I would explain to the installers how it NEEDED to be done they pushed back by saying that was not necessary. My SUV has a specific way to install the windshield that is out of the ordinary. If steps aren't followed then its going to leak. They assured me that it wouldn't leak the way they did it and I really did not want to put that to the test with their way of doing it. I supplied my own new factory gasket for the job. If I had not had that they would have reused the 20 year old gasket that was glued to the old windshield. The manual says to use a NEW gasket.\n\nAll the glass installers I have delt with to get this done have just about all been the same. They are payed by they job and want to get done and on to the next job. I care about my car and if I'm gong to pay to have this done I want it done right.

I don't appreciate their attitude towards my instructions I had for them.  I walked inside to get cash to pay them while they were working and quietly came back outside to hear them talking about me and how I was trying to micromanage them.
