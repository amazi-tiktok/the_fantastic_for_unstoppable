We are sorry your first experience at Rum Sisters was not the best. You must have been here right around Christmas. All the boxes you are referring to were some of the thousands of shipments we had going out for the holidays. It does not surprise me that we ran our of samples at that time of year, as we were running out of cake, too. We didn't even have cakes for display. That also explains why we only had our medium sized cakes available, what we call a small (feeds 6-8). Normally we do have samples available and all cake sizes in every flavor, as well. It was just an off day for us.\n\nRegarding the tip jar at the counter; our staff are trained in every aspect of the bakery- each person bakes cakes, wraps the cakes, boxes the cakes, washes the dishes/pans and handles many other incidentals in addition to offering customer service at the counter. As to whether you felt the service warranted a tip or not, is completely up to you. As the owner, I think it's nice to offer the option if someone feels they have received excellent service, as my staff work very hard.\n\nThe prices of our cakes reflect the quality ingredients we use and the labor intensive process involved in making the cakes. We offer cake from $5 to $45. based on servings that's about $2.25 for a slice of alcohol infused cake. I would also like to point out that alcohol is very expensive in the state of Alabama. So, if you are comparing regular cake pricing to alcohol infused cake pricing- they are just not the same.\n\nWe would like to have you back and try all the cakes! Please, give us another try. We strive for excellence and hope you can see that the next time you are in.\nThank you for your review and we hope to see you again, soon."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04df324c9abb:0x9a4726c5b61dd96a"}

That's why I was excited to go there to try some rum infused creations. When I entered the store, I was hoping to see multiple choices of cakes on the displays, but instead I saw sheleves full of folded T-shirts with their logo, I believe. For a moment I  thought I got into wrong store, because there were no cakes whatsoever. All of them were behind cash  register, they looked identical, wrapped and too far away from the customer.\nTo be honest, I was disappointed. I've decided to taste several flavors to decide which one I like the best. I couldn't taste rum flavor at all and consistency of each of them was too buttery, even detected margarine flavor. That's not what I expected in rum infused cakes. Unfortunately, that was good idea to create these cakes, but not very successful execution. As a business owner, instead of Tshirts I would put cake samples on the display. This is cake shop after all.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04df324c9abb:0x9a4726c5b61dd96a"}

I was thrilled to find out that their shop was just a couple miles up the road. I was also happy that  I wasn't getting hooked on this newly discovered favorite  only to start my usual long distance shopping and shipping relationship. Whew!\n\nI fid have one huge scare when I pulled in the parking lot one day, to get myself a cake or two :-) and my heart sank, oh no they're gone!! Bur I noticed a little paper on the door with a notice, they had moved and only over to Orange Beach, emergency avoided. I rushed over to the new place, which by the way is in a large outdoor mall with tons of parking on Beach Blvd. and the new dogs has a spacious and perfectly climate controlled interior with cushy swivel bar chairs. You can sit at the bar/counter and choose which one of the 8 or so flavors of rum cake you would like to sample. Isn't that fancy? Oh and you can get a coffee or milk or something whilevyou're at it, oh oh oh what's that ICE CREAM? Hey I didn't know what was going on because my favorite rum cake place was just this cramped, not too well lit, and usually a little too warm hole in the wall and not this Rodeo Dr boutiquey place where the pries were certainly going to get jacked up.\n\nWait, no need to panic as I see the cakes as just as good and the prices are the same and come to find out their old landlord took half if their already cramped space away and they had no choice but to find a bigger place. Well thank you very much evil landlord because I don't mind driving a few more minutes for my favorite island guilty pleasure.\n\nIndeed these rum cakes are absolutely delicious and they are really moist, full of infused flavor and their cakes actually melt in my mouth, seriously.\n\nI used to pretend that I just couldn't decide on which flavor I wanted in a full cake and therefore I would just have to take the 6 smaller (1 or 2 person size) or the sampler package. I would say that I needed to spend more time making up my mind, nope no more pretending,  now I just walk in and buy  my six favorite flavor cakes (iall the flavors are my favorites) and I'm getting my deal of 6 for the price of 5, well okay everybody gets that deal. These scrumptious little cakes are bigger than a fat cupcake and way better and besides now I'm getting my rum cakes in a six pack for the weekend and the big game or to go with the cookout. ;-)\n\nI'm not sure if the ladies that I originally met at the festival are actually sisters but take it from a real sailor, from way back, that's actually seriously high caliber and delicious rum. Whether it's dark rum or cocunut or some other flavor the sisters seem to masterfully pair the perfect cake recipe with the perfect premium rum. Speaking of sisters one of my many favorites is called \"twisted sista\" and I will say, while I write this and my mouth begins to water, that I have never settled on just one favorite. But hey that's okay because \"Big O\" will forever be my  first and my latest crush is \"Bushwacker\" Ooooo it's so good!\n\nI was super psyched when I discovered that they started making these slices of goodness available for ordering and shipping through\nAmazon because my six packs make a great gift and I have already shipped out some of these for birthday and Christmas gifts to some of my truly favorite friends and even a few relatives. Whether you buy them in-person or online they're still hand made, labeled and have little bows on them from these local folks and by the way you can get small, medium and large sizes for any size occasion. They are truly delicious cakes and now you can also get cookies and ice cream when you go in for your cake fix I think I'll have to go today :-)\n\nAhoy!!

The cake tasted amazing, and that part would get a solid five stars. However, what I ordered/expected...and what I was handed when I went in to pick it up are two VERY different things.  (photos attached to the review)\n\nI asked them to make a birthday cake using our car club's logo (photos attached). I've always been impressed with Ashley's decorating and never had a bad experience so I didn't give any further instructions other than saying I trust Ashley's design aesthetic.\n\nI stopped by around 2:30 in the afternoon just to see if it might be ready (my pickup time was to be about 6:30) and there were two younger girls behind the window decorating cakes, I didn't see Ashley anywhere. (I did see a stunning Harry Potter themed three-tier cake in the window -  it was truly beautiful.) They said they'd call me when it was ready and it would probably be before the expected 6:30 pickup time. They never called, I went back at 6:15. I walked in and was truly taken aback by how bad this cake looked. I didn't know what to say....I had to excuse myself and go to the car for a second because I was about to cry. So embarrassed to take to this to an event after telling folks about how beautiful AND tasty their cakes are.\n\nThe issues were:\nThe colors are completely wrong (I think maybe they used leftover icing from another order instead of making the red and blue needed - it was burgundy and a sort of blue-gray color instead of true red and true blue). Ashley's comment about the color - well as it dries it'll be brighter. Nope. Didn't happen.\n\nThen there are the circles - they aren't even circles. However, you can see the black lines on the cake that had been put there to trace in multiple places.\n\nThe letters are squished at the top and down the left side. They aren't sized nor shaped consistently across the whole cake for that matter.\n\nBottom line, I felt like I ordered a cake from a professional, and I got something that was decorated by an amateur. And honestly if Aunt Gussie had offered to make this for free and this is what I got - then ok. But that's not the case.\n\nWhen I went back inside I told Ashley I wasn't happy, and that I thought it looked really bad. She did ask what I'd like her to do. I said I don't know what you can do since you close in 10 minutes and I have to be somewhere in 40 minutes and this cake has to go to Huntsville tonight. There's no time. So I paid and took the cake.\n\nMy advice, the cakes are delicious. But maybe don't order anything that needs to be free-hand drawn, because you may be severely disappointed. I rarely post reviews - but gosh i'd hate for someone to go pickup a cake for a big event and be as disappointed as I was.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88882af9cc67170d:0xdc9e27deae1c3ba2"}

While both cakes tasted okay and looked okay (the grooms cake was quite a bit different than the picture they were given), they arrived 2 hours late. The bakery was 7 miles, approximately 13 minutes from the venue. The delivery time that was set up for 2 pm turned into 4 pm (and the wedding started at 5) therefore halting the decorating of both the bride and groom tables. There was no apology or explanation offered once the cakes finally arrived, nor on the phone when we called to inquire about the cakes, at which time whomever answered the phone wasn't polite at all. Obviously the cakes still had to be assembled and finished once they arrived, again 2 hours late, again interfering with other things that needed to be happening at this time, again without any sort of apology. Let me also mention that once the cakes were cut, approximately 2 hours after they arrived, which should have been 4 hours after they arrived, they were both still partially frozen inside.

My husband ordered a cake from Granna's Goodies for my birthday in good faith, and I sadly have to admit it was hands down the worst cake I have ever tasted or cut into. It was simply inedible. The texture was like rubber, the icing was grainy, and I couldn't serve it to my guests. Now, I'm all about supporting small business, and truly believe being honest with an owner is only fair so that they can make right by the issue at hand, and also to improve their product or service. I immediately called the owner and explained the issue with the cake. She was polite, sympathetic, and even offered to bake us another cake (hard pass) however, she never once offered to refund the money spent. I even physically took the inedible cake to her to show how awful it was, and all she said was 'sorry'.  I gave her ample opportunity to offer a refund (it shouldn't be my place to ask), and that is why I am writing this review.\n\nAs a previous small business owner myself of 30 years, it's Business 101 that you refund your customer if they have a viable complaint or dissatisfaction. No questions asked, no hassles. JUST DO IT. The cake I can do without and will never recommend Granna's for anything, but a 'sorry' isn't acceptable. I'm 'sorry' that I can't support a business that doesn't care about the quality of their products or doing the right thing by their customers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861d993b1b8b813:0x5b5f8d26ae5e4a1a"}

The imposing menu didn't quite represent the limited offerings in the display cases, but I get the feeling some of the bigger jobs are by request only.\n\nEven just focussing on the muffins and scones, Louisa does a fine job. The giant muffins are loaded with whatever they're supposed to be, from mound of carrots to handfuls of chocolate chips that start smudging your fingers and lips as you attack it. The crumbly scones are great with a cup of coffee. The sausage and cheese biscuits are unique in that sausage and cheese is baked right into the bread, and while the crumbly sausage is cooked so far past the point of offering anything more than a hint of umami, I appreciate the creativity.\n\nWhile the bakery is a worthwhile visit when you have a large order, you'll probably end up consuming most of your Louisa pastries at the adjacent Cafe Louisa, where you can enjoy her wares among good coffee and atmosphere.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ac40503199:0xc2843dced163c824"}

I visited Dreamcakes Cafe with my mother and sister for afternoon tea. It was such a special day for us because we planned afternoon tea right before they accompanied me to shop for my wedding dress! The staff knew this and were so excited, kind, and encouraging.\n\nWe made our tea selections a few days before our event via email. Kallie was wonderful about responding on email. We had to sign a contract prior to the tea and she made it very easy to do so. When we arrived to the cafe, our tea table was set up with everything we needed: teacups, utensils, saucers, even fresh flowers! The set up was stunning and the food was delicious! I highly recommend the pimento cheese sandwich with peach jam and the macarons!!\n\nDuring the tea, the wait staff made us feel so special. Someone was always by to ensure we had everything we needed, refill cups, etc and all of them were SO polite, friendly, and knowledgable about tea selections. My sister had a gluten and dairy allergy and they made sure she knew what she could and couldn't eat and even brought out a special cup of chicken salad for her.\n\nThank you Dreamcakes staff! You made this such a special day for us. The thought and time you put into the details of our tea was noticed and SO appreciated. It was perfect from start to finish. Hope to see yall again soon... we will be back!!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONY-oJn9BWzuTdb2Fi3h6atL79YWPl-U63vkJQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPHHd3s1HgC_MYEB8GlhgLV96Lk0wjV05Aiz7P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1626716965329, "text": "Thank you so much Erin!

For cookies, they are expensive but these are better than any other cookies I have had in a store. The chocolate chips were tasty and large, the dough was warm and the cookies were fresh.\n\nThey are also very large. One cookie should be enough for two people.

She totally snapped on that little guy saying \"NO, we are not taking any orders for Saturday.\"  I'm sure I can find a better recipe to make these Sun-drop rolls.....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b10cb8b37ad:0x59c861e71d0cedb9"}

The cakes are all butter, gourmet & all natural ingredients which are expensive. Let me start by saying the Snack cakes are 8.5 oz and our slices are 4 oz.  This means the Snack cakes are double the size of our 1\" thick slices. Also, the prices are shown above the cakes. The cost of the Red Velvet (specialty cake with creamcheese butter cream is actually $8.98 in Sam's Club not $7.48. The $7.48 cakes are non specialty flavors (Original, Lemon Blueberry, Key Lime & Chocolate). It sounds like there is a problem. We stand behind all of our product and I'd really appreciate if you would send a picture of the packaging and inside of the cake, if possible. We will ship you a replacement as we know our cakes are worthy and some of the BEST in the business. Please email us @ emilyshpc@gmail.com and we will gladly get to the bottom and rectify the issue.

I blame myself because I waited until the last minute to make a boarding appointment at my usually facility, which is Golden Animal Hospital in Pike Road(great service and care everytime!). We boarded our 18 month old golden doodle for 10 days. He was supposed to be groomed the last day he was there. We keep his hair long so he was only supposed to be washed and trimmed.\n\nWhen I dropped him off, the receptionist was nice enough but the place smelled very bad. I've used several dog care facilities since we're new to Montgomery and the Bakery was by far the worst in cleanliness.  The dogs and the administration area are all in one. This created a very unorganized check-in since the receptionist was moving, picking up and pushing dogs off the counter the entire check-in. I looked over this because we were literally flying out of town the same day.\n\n10 days later, I called to the Barkery know I was headed to pick my dog up. They told me that they had to cut his hair down low because he had a few matted areas on his legs. I didn't like that but its understandable. I arrive to the counter and the owner hands me a bag of hair to \"prove\" how bad the matts were! They brought my dog out and he was literally shaved down to skin\ud83d\ude25 It was so sad! They didn't even grind or clip his nails. It was clear that they had no clue what they were doing. They couldn't find his collar and leash. They said that I must have taken it with me. I usually take them with me at my normal grooming place but I thought I remembered leaving them. I didn't take the time to debate the point because I was almost numb at the sight of my dog. I just kept telling myself, \"This is your fault for waiting too long to make an appointment and taking him to the ONLY place that had an opening\" Now I know why they had an opening. For the life of me, I can not figure out how people are giving this place good reviews.\n\nWhen I get home and the family and I console each other, lol.....I find my dogs collar and flea collar buried in his door food that I had left with the Barkery. My dog also wouldn't eat for days after we got him back and he was sick for at least a week. He sneezing and vomiting. Btw, he smelled horrible. I was trying to figure out what they used to wash him and if they actually bathed him the day before I picked him up.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever and I would learn to groom my own dog if this was the only place open. On top of all of this, the receptionist and owner never apologized for the haircut. They basically blamed me because I let him get matts.\n\nWorst experience ever!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}

Kimberly ran inside the building, never spoke, never apologized and sent Jake, who is not an owner of The Barkery,  to \"deal\" with us. Apparently, Kimberly had lied to Jake and told him that she was threatened by myself on the phone and was called a b****h, which was untrue, I was actually quite pleasant all considered. When Kimberly finally came outside, I asked her was she ever threaten or called any obscenity and she said no that never happened. Jake went off to smoke his KOOL cigarette, because the whole reason he came was because of her lie.Why Kimberly would make herself to be the victim when she lost my dog is beyond me. Kimberly yelled us, blamed us,  cursed, and never once apologized. I understand that things happen, but if you're a dog sitter and you lose the dog, you need to take some form of responsibility and at least be sorry and try to help. Instead of being concerned,  Kimberly(owner) and her daughter, and another staff member keep screaming about their \"Livelihood\".  Thankfully, me and my family were able to go out looking at 6:00 am and posting lost posters and found Midnight near Huntingdon College. The staff members saw us looking for our dog, offered no help, and still no apology.  Today is July 9, and The Barkery has never followed up, or showed any concern for their negligence. My dog refuses to leave me or my sisters side since this event, so I'd advise you to find another place to drop off your four legged family member.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}

A few have made it to being a fan favorite - Cherry Amaretto, Pumpkin Spice, Toasted Coconut, and Orange Cranberry. The regular size scones are a bit more moist, and have a stronger flavor.\n\nWe highly recommend them, and have not been disappointed with any of our orders!!

The cake was an absolute revelation. I shared some with my friend and she said it reminded her of something happy from childhood.\n\nWhile I loved the taste of the pina colada, I wasn't crazy about the texture. The bits of coconut and fruit chunks didn't do it for me though I am convinced that they use the real stuff since the pineapple affected my tastebuds just like real pineapple will do.\n\nThe display cases were sparse, as one reviewer noted, but I really appreciate placing an ethic of food conservation over aesthetics. There's no need for good food to go to waste, as it does every day in larger establishments, just to keep a display case full all the time.

Nothing in the stores come close. Son't even get me started on the desserts. And now I found out they sell food too?!\n\nIm just a stranger on the internet and there is no good reason why you should trust me, but when has that ever stopped you from making a bad decision before?

I am glad to hear you found the cakes you wanted, as you were very undecided in what you wanted for a cake. So not sure it would have been more or less as we couldn't give you a price when you were so undecided about what design you wanted and most of the cake you showed us were Very fancy fondant which is a lot more than than a buttercream cake. Also you wanted the cake in less than two weeks, which is not traditionally enough time to order a wedding cake. You had emailed me on Thursday and ask if you could come in Tomorrow for a consult.

I visited this place with my family yesterday. They had samples of their lemon cake out and they were super delicious. So I purchased a small lemon bundt cake. I was super excited to get back home (which is in Tuscaloosa) to partake in this treat.

Me trying to be a good husband, she told me that she would like to try so I immediately told her let's do it. We called to make our order and were both very happy with the customer service and ease of the process and selection on short notice. We were on the circle across town so we made it there in just a few minutes. I went inside and was greeted in the most cozy, comfy place I had ever been in Dothan by a very sweet, kind lady(wish I had gotten her name so I could thank her on here but too late now, thank you for you're awesome service). Our order was already prepared that quickly but the case had items my wife didn't mention so risking getting in trouble (lol not really but husband's will understand) I asked if I could add a few items and without hesitation she was ready to help me. She packaged it up, gave me a total, I paid, and left it was a wonderful all around experience. This was the simplest part of this review lol. Skip forward a few hours, we are home and have had dinner and my wife is ready to try out the cupcakes. We both had a red velvet cupcake first and we had to stop what we were doing and thinking about to take in the experience that was happening. I can not explain in words how perfect they were, texture, smell and the taste... OMG, hands down the best red velvet anything that I've ever had my entire life (I'm 33), we then had to try another one so we each tried a different one so we could taste more without eating too much and still try more because we are still both in shock of the amazing thing happening. I got a key lime cupcake and she got a birthday cake cupcake, again we both were blown away by how incredible this all was. She is actually rushing me now because I had to stop then and write this review to let anyone know, who has a sweet tooth or any reason to get a treat, this is the place to go. We will go back in future and tell everyone we know to go try it because it is that great of an all around experience start to finish. Thank you so much and we look forward to the next time.\n\nUpdate to the review, this is the next day and my wife has started negotiating terms of the last cupcake because they are that amazing.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890458fdc68ebeb:0x1bcdce01641345de"}

We had to wait 45 minutes for them to bring out a couple of sandwiches and a salad with ranch dressing that tasted like sour cream. I even requested one thing to not be on something and yet after the 45 minute wait the item is still put there. I had 3 other people with me and they also had the same complaint of how the food and dressing is. I got a sandwich with bread that was basically rock hard and broke up in little pieces.

Cara's Cafe was previously Frankie's Deli and we had been there a few times and really enjoyed it. We got a glimpse of Cara's menu via Facebook and found quite a few entries we were anxious to try. We finally made it to Cara's yesterday (3 Jul 2020) for lunch.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and grabbed a paper menu to make our selections.  Making just 2 selections was tough, as everything sounded delicious.  For lunch, we opted on a Pesto Chicken Salad Sandwich on Croissant and the Mufalletta Sandwich on a French roll. Several counter pastries caught our eye as we were going over the menu so we added a piece of German Chocolate Cake, 2 Cannoli's, a frozen Peach Cobbler (for later consumption), and 2 Blueberry-Lemon cupcakes.  Cara's also offers frozen casseroles to take home and heat up, so we opted to grab a Jumbalaya with Conecuh Casserole for a 4th of July lunch.  After we received our sandwiches and our remaining order was bagged, we ventured over to the Alleyway in downtown Wetumpka for an outdoor table. Both sandwiches were EXCELLENT and the Italian Pasta Salad was DELICIOUS! We followed our sandwiches with the Cannoli's and cupcakes and they were just as DELICIOUS as everything else! While at the Wetumpka fireworks show last night, we gobbled up the German Chocolate Cake which was also DELICIOUS! We cannot wait to try the Jumbalaya Casserole today and Peach Cobbler.  We also had a great conversation with Bert and Katie while we were there.  They were so helpful and courteous! It goes without saying, we will be back to Cara's soon to try some other things...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c27bc4a2d3855:0x398c69ab2af30d4f"}

They will still be delicious. As our shipping policy states, we send everything out to arrive in two days, which we did in your case. Unfortunately as with any merchant, we are at the mercy of the performance of USPS or UPS and have no influence on either. Both shipping services have a very high success right even in peak season and we watch this closely. It\u2019s very disappointing for us too when they have delays which happened in your case.\n\nAs for delivery to a P.O. Box, I\u2019m assuming that is a secure mailbox for the dental office that is used to protect their mail delivered outside of business hours. Again, that was for the USPS to decide. We shipped to the address you provided.\n\nI explained this to you both times we spoke this week and apologized for the delay. We do our part to ship fresh cookies and purchase 2-day shipping, which is our responsibility. But the shipping services don\u2019t offer guarantees on delivery and sometimes they let us all down. We\u2019ve put extensive details about this on our website to make it very clear, and you checked a box in checkout agreeing to this policy. We did our best to get your cookies there on Wednesday, and the USPS obviously had some unusual performance issues this week.\n\nThank you for the feedback,\nLiz\np.s. We have no bearing on when the Post Office or UPS delivers packages - no merchant does. You've made some pretty unfair statements about our bakery.

If you expect a professional, courteous, or clean place to eat then this is not the place for you. I have frequented this place off and on for over 20 years and I have never seen its standards lower. After standing in front of the counter for 5 minutes while the employee socialized with one of his friends I was finally asked for my order only to be told that it would be a 10 minute wait. Okay, fine everyone likes warm fresh food so I consented. Then to my surprise the employee bags up a package of cinnamon buns and then gives them to his waiting friend for free as I'm standing there at the register. Where I come from that's called theft. Next, as other potential customers come by they are simply told that they are out of everything with the implication being the employees had no intention of preparing any more products. Then after another customer comes up who had obviously preordered, the manager is asked by the employee at the register to make change for a $20 which she goes in the back to retrieve only to return to kneading dough without any visible sign of having washed her hands and absent wearing gloves. Finally, after my 13 minute wait, the front counter employee tells me, \"Oh, all I have is 1 order of cinnamon sticks\" with the full knowledge that I had requested 3. When I asked who was in charge the employee initially stated that he was, then when I requested the contact info for a regional supervisor he retreated to the back office and returned with the previously aforementioned manager who then tells me that she is in charge. The two feigned politeness, but I'm certain it was only in an attempt to prevent me from contacting someone who is really in charge.
