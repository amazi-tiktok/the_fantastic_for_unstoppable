They've done a good job with social distancing and seem to be observing good precautions. The beer selection is more than adequate for a restaurant but disappointing for a place named \"public house\".\n\nThe house fries with sauces are a reasonable attempt at frites, but the fries came sans salt. They came with a mild chili-ketchup, aoili mayo, and a chipotle style sauce. The super salad was good, but did not differentiate itself from the dozens of similar salads.\n\nThe chicken and waffles looked nice but did not have the depth or heat hoped for. The crystal hot sauce was minimalistic. The corn dog looked to be dressed up but the acid was unbalanced with the other flavors making it more hippie than hipster.\n\nOverall, it was very ok. We were hoping for a more \"foodie\" experience and were disappointed.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGBmEvc0y6cv43-LM84-R2a_-ykkGcvGEX0gkF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgkvVHvarIMQ6YBMSafvaKwLCBdSH7fKZiglZ8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEoVPkHarAiBIiyguyg65giuh9YeCik3fw5otO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwWAfaTr0cswijpdIhcY52NS3T4-xKxJ1QqY7z=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY-wa3kKKsQhvVvjLPSlMyPKQDmfxNO83PvZPR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919c9c52ca5d1:0xa4c9f59e8f20aad8"}

I had ranch dressing which was homemade but not fantastic nor horrible. There was some dried herb or flavor that did not seem authentic to my ranch tastes but it was edible.

After we sat down we waited at least 30 minutes before our drink order was taken. And even then it was the owner that finally came over to take it.

We sat waiting for our food to come out for another 20 minutes before our appitizers came. The waitress then said that there were no more mashed potatoes, which is what my husband and I had ordered for our sides. We asked for baked potatoes instead. They were also out of that. Ok things happen. So we decided on fries and chips instead. Not even 5 minutes later the table behind us, one of the tables who was sat 30 minutes after us, got their food. Which included both mashed potatoes and baked potatoes. Up until this point we were a little annoyed but fine, this made it much worse. We had mostly lost our appetites by this time. We mentioned to the waitress about all of this and she apologized. Nothing was done to try and rectify the situation though.

The waitress stated yes! So my brother and I ordered porterhouses to be turned down five minutes later because they were out.\nAnd they could have a good beer selection but the beers I wanted to go out of too.\nI hope that the two times that I have visited this place was just bad luck but as of right now this is very poor Matt list because they didn't have anything on their menu that I wanted\nI would like to give it more stars the food was good but just due to the fact that I've been there twice and they don't have the options on the menu that I like and want this is very poor with me", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd42d282633a7:0x64cdb53202edfde7"}

This was NOT it. We had no idea what to expect and we did read other reviews that complained about the price but we have no issue, if the service is good and the food is quality, so we headed over to Fred and Lesters. We were thrown off from the beginning. People were smoking on the front porch when we got there and when we walked in we were greeted in the fashion you would expect from folks that were very disorganized. The atmosphere is ok for a family type country establishment but it is not a date night place-by any measure. All I thought of was \"based on the looks of this place, the steak must be truly amazing\" . We waited for 20 minutes and no one ever even acknowledged us. We finally asked someone if we had a server and she was kind enough to get someone to help us. Not going well so far but we were happy to finally have our drinks-which sat at the bar so long that we almost went up and just grabbed them ourselves. We ordered the fried green tomatoes and they were good and the sauce for the tomatoes was tasty. We were ready to order our dinner and the waitress came and explained to us that they were out of SEVERAL of the steaks-and I think they only had a total of 5 choices. They were out of porterhouse and they were out of another one-cant remember which one. I asked her which steak she recommended and she said the filet, which was my first choice-BUT then she told me that the filet was NOT part of the quality meat that they are supposedly known for. I asked her what that meant and she said \"it is basically grocery store\". So I kind of chuckled and ordered the rib eye.....I really did not know how to take that but it was kind of funny. My husband ordered the ribs. My steak came with a salad and it was truly the most pathetic little limp salad I have ever received-except for maybe the few times I had a salad at waffle house. Limp lettuce and served in a thin wood bowl, like you would purchase at The Dollar Store. I could not finish it. But we were there for the steak. We continued to sit and talk and noticed that they had a patio outside where music was playing and since our food was no where to be found-It had been 45 minutes since we ordered we went out the back door to see what the patio area was like. It is a cute little area and the band seemed like they were quite talented but I was shocked that they were serving food to people while groups of other people were sitting right on the patio area smoking. I am not that particular but it was pretty gross and the smell of cigarettes was very strong the second that back door opened. I really did not think this was allowed any longer by the Health Department but maybe it is. We went back inside and had simply had enough and asked the waitress where our food was. She was sweet and smiled and said she would check and by that time I explained to her that it had been a full hour. We waited another 10 minutes with no reply from her and then told her to get our check and we would not be staying any longer. She told the manager who came by and said very quietly \"Sorry about that\". That was it!!! And it was a very half-a-- apology. Basically I would not return if it was FREE. My time is more valuable then to spend it at an establishment that manages itself in this manner. On a side note-the waitresses congregate around the computer screen for ever. This establishment needs to move the computer screen to an area other than the middle of the restaurant so it is not so obvious that no one knows what they are doing. I felt strong enough about it to write this review in hopes that others do not waste their time or money.\nAdd to list\nEdit\nShare Your Review", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd42d282633a7:0x64cdb53202edfde7"}

I went one time when my party and I were the only patrons and it still took 15 minutes to get a drink order, 30 minutes to get a food order, and over an hour to get our food. I got my appetizer less than five minutes before my entree. Another person at my table got his appetizer after he got his entree. We both ordered the same appetizer that could have been prepared all at once (fried pickles).\n- Food:\nIt's not that good. I've tried a variety of things. The oysters are about like any other oyster place. Everything else is either okay or not good. Being too salty seems to be a common thread. Absolutely not worth the wait.\n- Price:\nA bit on the expensive side for this kind of place.\n- Bar:\nThe only redeeming feature. It's poorly stocked, but has a good atmosphere.\n- Overall:\nI simply don't come here anymore unless I'm meeting people, and even then I'll try to convince them to go somewhere else. The only exception is the bar. I don't mind the bar. But food-wise? Absolutely not.

We didn\u2019t have to wait for a table and were able to sit down right away.

I feel like this should be posted somewhere on the menu.\nWe tried to order several appetizers and they were out of a lot of them because it was Sunday and the waiter said they were consistently out of food after the weekend. I feel like if this is a big enough problem where your staff knows it\u2019s every weekend then it could be addressed in the kitchen.\nWe tried the Funkdified Fried Brie, the big pretzel, the Dirty Bird chicken sandwich, the chicken and waffle sandwich, the chili chili bang bang burger, and the seared tuna blt, also the fish and chips. All of our food came with sauces on the side and they were amazing. The ranch is the best I\u2019ve had anywhere. The Slap Yo Mama sauce that comes with the Dirty Bird chicken sandwich was really good. The beer cheese for the pretzel was divine. That\u2019s about as good as it got though. The food was all very just ok.  I would not recommend the Mac and cheese.\nThe beer selection was fabulous!

Well we get out drinks in about 7 minutes. So, we sit waiting for our appetizer to come thinking it would get to us in atleast 5-20 minutes but it didn't get to us until 48 minutes later. Well we were ready to leave by then but we decided to stay and wait on our actual food. That took another 30 minutes and we rushed to eat because we were going to see a movie. I really think our waiter didn't know what he was doing because we had to ask another waiter on our food and how much  longer it would take. No one came and really came and checked on us we had to ask if we ever needed anything else. Our waiter also did not wash his hands after handling money in which he went and refilled drinks.

Well, I normally give an establishment 2-3 times before writing them off.. So, between the wife and I, we have been here at least 3 times. Several people in our group had been multiple times as well..\n\nI'll start with the sever.. While she was definitely nice and friendly, she was just not good at serving people. EVERYTHING TOOK FOREVER .. Drink order (we had water), took 20 minutes.. Then another 10 minutes to get it. All in all, we were there 3 1/2 hours.. Not because we were lounging.. It literally took that long to get our drinks, appetizers and meals, etc.. It took so long , several (about 4-5 people) left our group (started with 12), before we had the cake for the \"birthday\"..\n\nWe sat with empty water glasses until another server saw it and stepped in to help.\n\nThe food: it was okay.. That is about the best I can give it. My wife was there a week before and had a burger and it was very dry.. Just plain out over cooked. Same thing happened the other night to everyone who had a burger. They all said the same thing; over cooked.. I even heard someone say, \"Man, I even like my burgers cooked a little on the well done side, but this is something else\"..\n\nAnother problem; When the food finally came out, it was lukewarm. I also saw a \"chef\" in the back remove the lid off of a small plastic container (looked like dressing) that a server brought to him. He smelled it, dipped his pinky finger in it and tasted. He then proceeded to put the lid on it and hand it back to the server while he was shaking his head in a yes gesture. She then walked out of the kitchen with it and brought it to a table.\n\nI could go on and on.. But I won't. They may have good beer, but I don't drink.. So, there is that.. But if you like loud places, with mediocre food, this is your place..\n\nP.S.... Now, several in our group said the one down town was better, but I wouldn't know.. I have never been down there to that one and I will not go. Especially after this experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd128ae221d:0x93e28fbb765f143a"}

I would call it more...\"flavorless yellow flour paste\".Flour and fat mixed together with salt. The cheese they so boldly claimed to be in the dip, clearly has the wisdom to avoid the company of such poor preparation, and has chosen to steer clear of association with this so called \"cheese sauce\".
