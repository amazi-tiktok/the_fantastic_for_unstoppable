Dude didn't hook up the wires of the back up camera to the new system he installed. I was in a rush so left and came back another day. Dude tells me the new system didn't have an back up camera input. Yea Right. I wouldn't have bought the system if that was the case. I take it to an Audio shop that I use all the time to get all my stuff installed including the other after market radio that was replaced by the new one. They call me to the back and show me where the wires where just thrown in the back of the dash versus using just 1 cable tie and where on the back of the system, it clearly has a wire and and input that says CAM. Not to mention they gave me a dash kit that fit the radio so you can't see the gap between the head unit and the dash board. I've gotten a lot of cars tinted here by other workers, but never had the manager himself work on my car and never got electronics installed here and will never again.

GO ANYWHERE ELSE! !\n\nIf you don't feel like reading the entire review I understand so the short version is this.\nMy truck left there worse than it went in and I paid them almost $300 to do that. Lights now don't work, instrument lights don't work, if I turn the AC on after starting the truck it resets the audio system. Wires hanging, trash left in the truck and really, REALLY poor service and lack of respect. When I told the owner about the problems and that I simply wanted a refund for labor only  because I don't feel comfortable letting them back into my wiring he said \"good luck bro! Try and get your money back and I'll sue YOU!\".\nI never want back because after checking the receipt it clearly says no refunds which makes sense when you do work like this.\n\nThe quality of workmanship AND professionalism was and still is the worst I've ever encountered.\nI have NEVER written a review and I'm 30 years old and have dealt a lot in business. The fact that I'm writing this review is an extreme for me.\n\nThe stereo system they \" installed \" for me is very cut and dry.  I supplied the head unit, subwoofer and amp for '02 Tahoe. When I called to make an appointment they said come in first thing Monday (I called on Friday ) and this wasn't a problem for me.\nWhen I called Monday morning to find out why my fiance was waiting in the parking lot for 45 minutes just to see someone they told me they're audio guy doesn't work Mondays but \"they'll make it work\".\nAfter 4 hours of \"installing\" she finally left. When I got home from work and inspected the work I found the following:\n\n1) Wires freely hanging run across my pedals.\n2) The sub and amp were installed on the wrong side of the vehicle after being told 5 times and told to 3 different employees where to put it. I even set it up on the side I wanted it on and they put it opposite.\n3) I was told they tune the system before it leaves the shop. They're \" tuning \" involved them turning everything to the maximum capacity and leaving it. Dangerous to any electronics.\n4) They didn't have the materials needed to do a professional installation on my head unit (which is a $650 Kenwood double din) so I still have spaces beside the unit and looks like ass and nothing like a factory install like they assured me it would.\n6) Left trash wire and clippings all through out my truck. When I mentioned this the OWNER told me \"there was already trash there.\" There wasn't. I keep a clean truck. And when I mentioned the poorly ran wiring he told me it couldn't be because he did the wiring HIMSELF! !\n\nI could list more but you get the idea and as I said I don't write reviews.

I actually met his wife before I met him, although I'm not sure they were married or even acquainted that early on. I was in contract food service and she worked in a similar profession dealing with conventions and such. These are people of high moral character. Mark has done my window tinting, alarms, remote start feature, and some small bit of sound systems. I would like to tell you what you can experience from doing business with Mark, but it's much easier to tell you what you will not experience. With Mark's expertise, in his line of business, you can expect NOT to bring your vehicle back in a second time because of something that was not quite right. He is very conscientious about his work and takes pride in the job that he does although you will likely not see that side of him for his humble personality gets in the way of that. My oldest son is a die hard customer of Mark's but his thing is the sound systems in his vehicle. Whether it's me or my son, when we trade cars/SUV's, the first stop is Audio Creations. I have never considered his prices to be anything other than reasonable except for times when I've asked him if he is actually coming out ahead based on the charge. Never does he overcharge or do any unnecessary work. Here is a long story that I will attempt to give you the readers digest version. Some years ago, I bought a used suburban for my wife when she retired. A '99 suburban had a 40 gal gas tank & here is the significance of that. It had been very well kept up & as soon as we took possession from the individual the first stop was to see Mark. He pulled it in the shop & began work on the window tint, alarm, & remote start. A couple of days later when he finished, & went to start the truck & pull it out of the garage, it wouldn't start! What kind of electrical mistake had he made while installing the alarm & remote start? NONE!! Who would have thought a fuel pump would go out after the truck was pulled into the shop & the ignition cut off? That would not have occurred to anyone. Mark back tracked all the wiring to the point where the truck was before his work began. That took hours & hours, in fact days, but at that point we knew it was mechanical. I had the suburban towed from his shop to my auto mechanic, James Daniel, who by the way is just like Mark when it comes to excellence. He knew right away that on that long suburban with the 40 gal tank, it could be nothing else but a fuel pump. After replacing the fuel pump, it was back in Mark's hands to put the alarm system & remote start back in a second time & he asked for no additional charge. I did however pay him extra but not near enough to compensate for all the time & trouble that he went through. One last thing, I don't do business with anyone that I cannot establish a solid friendship with. Mark is my friend first, & my special, tech, tint, alarm, person second. He knows his stuff & you & your vehicle are in good hands with Mark. No one better.Very recently he even came to my house when I was out of town and my wife called him because my suburban, my Chevy Z truck, and even my Harley would not start. Before I left for my out of town trip I suspected I was having a problem with my alarm on our '04 suburban that he put in '09. It wasn't. In all three cases it was the batteries. He found my battery charger in the garage and got the suburban up and running so my wife was not stranded. His kindness in making a \"House Call\" given the circumstances was more than gracious. My wife had to twist his arm to get him to take even a small gratuity. This is the mark of CHARACTER!! This is MARK PICOGONA & Audio Creations.!!!!

The television was out of warranty just a few months and we had bought an extended warranty.  We called the extended warranty service and they directed us to Samsung the television manufacturer.  We were told that the only authorized service company was A/V video repair.\n\nThe first time that they came they asked for a check.  The technician helped my son get the television off of the wall and he identified the issue.  The technician then helped my son put the television back on the wall.\nHe left without providing a card, a receipt or any documentation indicating what the issue was. Since the technician came in a personal vehicle with no identifying signage, I had to call around town to identify who we had just given our check to.\n\nIn about a week (on a Monday), the company called to say that they had the part and again, the technician helped my son get the television off of the wall only to find out that they had misdiagnosed the problem.  I said at that time that there would not be any way of getting the television back down and that they needed to order the part and be back before the Thursday.  This information was not related to , or the company chose to ignore our request. At no time did the company status us, contact us to let us know that there was not going to be a way to fix the problem before the date we had stated.  Instead, they called on a Monday with the expectation that we would be there and that they needed to come on Wednesday.\n\nWhen the technician showed up on Wednesday, I had to send them back because there was no one to take the television down. I said that we had specifically stated that there would not be anyone here to do this if they did not provide the service in a timely manner.\n\nThey left a message with me trying to arrange another time. I called back and explained that I was not happy with the level of service that we had so far been provided.  That in addition to not getting the right part, we needed to have someone come out with the technician to get the television off of the wall.  I felt that this was the least that they could do given the issues that they had in diagnosing the issue with the television.\n\nAt this time I was told that they could not guarantee that the next part that they had ordered would work and that the television had to be the floor in order to service it.  I stated that this was not an option.  They stated that they could simply send the part back.  I then requested to talk to a manager that said \"The television has to be on the ground\".  I then requested that the manager speak with my husband at which point the manager stated \"Are you not capable of telling your husband what happened?\"\n\nWhen I stated that I was going to file a formal complaint with the better business  and angies list.  He said that I could call 1800 BBB, 1800 Angies list and 1800 I dont give a darned who you call.  At that point I hung up.\n\nI have already called Samsung and they are putting me in touch with another more competent service center that will ensure that the diagnosis identified is correct.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862841ff07ad52b:0x9f9a5d9924d8896c"}

I went here in June and spoke with Ben about correcting an issue that was caused at another car audio place.\n\nBen assured me that it would be an easy fix and told me to come by the following week. I called one day that next week and Ben said that they were too busy on that particular day. I asked if I could just make an appointment instead. Ben said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m kinda tied up right now. Try us again later this week.\u201d\n\nI was in the area the following week so I went by. After greeting me, Ben remembered me and immediately told me that they couldn\u2019t get to my car that day. I told him that I wasn\u2019t expecting a same-day service. I, instead, wanted to make an appointment. Ben thanked me for coming by and told me that the shop had been so busy.\n\nHe, again, assured me that the shop could easily correct the problem. He went on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s really a five-minute fix. I could do it now, but I don\u2019t want to just in case something happens and makes it longer than that and throw our day off.\u201d\n\nMy appointment was set for Wednesday, July 8th at 9:30am. I used PTO at work so that I could finally get the issue taken care of. The evening before my appointment, Ben called and told me they would have to cancel (not reschedule) my appointment because they didn\u2019t get a chance to finish a car from the previous day. He went on to say that they could probably do it at \u201csome other time\u201d and he\u2019d call me to let me know when. Of course, I was never called.\n\n\u2022Why would you tell your customer that you\u2019re too busy to give them an appointment? Especially when there are others working in the office.\n\n\u2022Why are you making the customer chase you as if this is the only place that could correct the issue?\n\n\u2022I understand that the shop may have been busy, or behind schedule. Why not reschedule my appointment?\n\n\u2022If you did not want to (or could not) perform the work, you should\u2019ve been upfront. It was a waste of both of our time.\n\nThis is the second Jimmy\u2019s Car Stereo location I\u2019ve had a poor experience at.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c17a0d019b:0x6ae2aef67374d317"}

All of this could have been easily avoided if they wouldn\u2019t have tightened it SO TIGHT! Completely unnecessary, especially considering how close the fuse box and the battery are put together which already makes it hard enough to losen. I would have rather used that money I spent on a mechanic at Jimmy\u2019s getting more audio equipment because they have great stuff.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c17a0d019b:0x6ae2aef67374d317"}
