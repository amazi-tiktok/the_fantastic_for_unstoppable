I brought the Ukulele back the next day and he told me I couldn't  return it because he is a wholesale dealer and the said \"no returns\". I did not look at the signs he had in the store or my receipt because I paid him in cash. Needless to say I left as a very unhappy customer. Now, I went on line to see what this Ukulele sells for because if he's a wholesale dealer I should have saved some money on the ukulele.  With tax, I paid $98 plus dollars and I could have paid $36.00 with free shipping on line.  This guy should not be in business and  he ripped me off. Had he taken it back or......put the cost of the ukulele toward another one there wouldn't have been a problem....So much for him saving me money because he's a wholesale dealer.   He's dishonest!

However, you may have gotten a compounded medication from us. May I ask if this prescription was a compound? If this was a compounded medication, we should have let you know that compounds will take at least 2 working days to make. This 2 day delay is because of the time it takes to hand make a compounded medication. Also, we are not open on the weekends, so these 2 working days may be stretched to be 4 actual days before you can pick up your compounded medication. Compounding is a very labor intensive and precise task that cannot be rushed if we are going to produce a quality medication to the exact specifications of your prescribing physician. I apologize if we failed to mention this delay when you came to fill with us. I would like to make things right by offering a $50 store credit to apply to any future purchase with us. Please call the pharmacy and ask for me. I would love to speak with you about resolving this issue. ~ Jeffrey (Owner, Pure Life Pharmacy)"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a0de686e7fa35:0xbfcd9a8677a0e406"}

The reason I'm giving you 3 stars is because your sales service seems to be misinformed and quite rude. I came in today (5/30/17) for creatine monohydrate. I left with nothing. The young girl running the store today asked why monohyrdate and when I voiced my \"opinion\" of this being the most researched and proven form of creatine I was scoffed at. This was baffling because I assumed her to have experience being the only one present in the store. Anyone with experience in the fitness industry knows this statement to be factual. The National Center for Biotechnology and Information as well as the International Society of Sports Nutrition have published many medical journals/articles regarding this. Okay, so maybe she was trying to sell me another product, fine I understand it's a business. It doesn't stop there though. Then she proceeds to tell me that another product creatine glycerol phosphate is superior to creatine monohydrate and all of Metabolic Nutrition's products have been evaluated by the FDA. This was quite concerning. First of all, you are misleading people. The FDA does not regulate dietary supplements. I showed her on the bottle where it clearly says \"These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to treat, cure, prevent or diagnose any disease\". I explained this by referencing the H.R.4771 - Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014. My point behind this was the only time the FDA steps in for supplements is after they have been to the shelf in stores and caused problems. She informs me that the act did not stop Pro-Hormones from being sold and asked if I was going to run and tell on them for selling them.. REALLY?? Furthermore, she had no knowledge of how the other product was superior. She told me she believed this product to be better because of what other customers have told her. Hearsay and reading the label, assuming it to be factual is not very scientific. If you want to sell a product this is not the way to do it! Additionally, I would like to say on my last visit to Absolute the service I received from Jordan was excellent. He was quite experienced, friendly, and informed regarding the products we discussed. Overall I probably won't let this incident stop me from shopping here, but in my opinion misleading people from the truth should not go unheard and if you don't know the truth perhaps you shouldn't be speaking.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496194866647, "text": "Hi Mitchell,\n\nI'm very sorry to hear your experience with us today was a negative one.

Our sign, placed in front of the door where you actually have to read it and go around it to access the door states, and I quote exactly: \"ATTENTION - IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MASK OR FACIAL COVERING, PLEASE STAY OUTSIDE. WE WILL CURBSIDE YOUR ORDER. CALL 334-277-9925.\n\nThe sign also states: \"DUE TO THE RISK OF CONTAMINATION, ALL SALES ARE FINAL - NO REFUNDS.\"\n\nYou were not refused service as you have incorrectly stated - you were refused entrance to the INSIDE of our business since you had no facial covering. You were given the option to our curb side service - which you refused to take advantage of. We provide a nice, socially distanced safe outside sitting area for those without masks or facial coverings to use. We actually have a large amount of customers who prefer the outdoor curbside service and delivery option.\n\nWe require this of everyone - regardless of race, color, gender, religious or political orientation. Why you consider yourself some elite exception in that you feel that you have some special entitlement, are better than all our other customers,  and can disregard our store policy, which has been in effect for many months now, I do not know - and there are no exceptions to our store entrance policy. We are a privately owned and operated local, family business - and we set the store policy here.\n\nYou are not entitled or above all our other customers who follow the store policy and are very, very happy to be able to shop in such a sanitary, healthy and very friendly 32+ year service and community oriented business\n\nAll of us wear our correct facial coverings all day long. We do take short breaks from wearing the coverings when not in the store to allow for C02 reduction and etc - but are right back on when back inside the store.\n\nFunny, but no one here remembers anyone of your mask intolerance issue trying to come in. What ever - there is an outside curbside service area for those reading this post who may have some type of facial mask/covering issue that can benefit from this incident, and know there is an outside curbside service option for them.\n\nWe  hope you find your happy place to shop.

Fresh organic sustainable food, and dry goods that rival any large grocery store. I\u2019ve bought probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins, minerals, alkaline water and so much more. They offer local products too, like honey and candles. The personalized one on one service they offer is above and beyond any local store. They are kind, compassionate and helpful to anyone asking questions when faced with so many choices. Anything and everything they ever suggested for me helped me so much. Now, with the Covid-19, they are asking people to wear masks in the store or plan to call ahead and order what you need and they will bring it out to you, curbside. People complaining they cannot wear a mask have the alternative to call from their car, make an order and literally in seconds they bring it to your car. I also have health issues where I cannot breath if I wear a mask. I ordered a couple minutes before reaching their store and had my purchase soon as I pulled into the parking lot. I don\u2019t understand people thinking the store staff try to push only the products that they use themselves. They have not done that to me in all my times in store. Well. That doesn\u2019t include the time they suggested some tasty tea, though. All in all, there\u2019s not another place around that offers what Healthwise Foods does. Check them out for yourself.

Healthwise is the store you have been searching for!\n\nI have shopped at Healthwise for over 15 years. The owners stay on the leading edge of knowledge related to health and nutrition. They are always available to assist you with answering your questions. They have never rushed me and they take the time to answer all my questions. I trust them for their extensive knowledge of nutritional and holistic treatments and practices.\n\nAdditionally, I trust them to validate and verify that their suppliers are actually providing the product identified on the package. Many large chain stores and grocery stores sell brands that are nothing but sawdust and powder. You can be confident you are getting the product on the label. They also sell grass-fed beef and other meat products that are healthy for you -- not full of hormones and antibiotics.\n\nThe owners require their staff members to train on which herbs or supplements would be the best solution to address whatever health condition you are trying to treat. The staff is very friendly and they are right there to help you if you have a health related question, or you can't find a product you are looking for.\n\nI realize the are other health stores in the local marketplace. I have stepped into some of them as I was driving around town. I was curious about their knowledge of health and nutrition, the suppliers they purchased from, and the prices they were charging for the different products I regularly purchase. I could not find any store who could match the knowledge of owners and staff at Healthwise. The range of products were usually not as extensive as Healthwise and the prices were comparable to Healthwise.\n\nI trust the owners of Healthwise and the quality of the products they sell.

Margo recommended I try CBG oil for both my pain and energy issues.  I'm now completely off all my prescription meds and am doing much better than I had been on them.  I've learned to manage my pain and energy in a much more effective way that doesn't mess with my weight or personality.

I can\u2019t say enough about the friendliness of Mrs Margo!!! Now if you are are on the fence about trying the CBD products, here\u2019s my suggestion for you: DO IT!!! My husband and I have decided to try it out over the last week and a half or so, and there have been MAJOR differences!!!!\n\nMy personal testimony for the CBD products: I have synthetic cartilage, a medal plate and six screws that sit across the orbital bone in the right side of my face. You can imagine the pain it causes. My first time in to check out the store and the products, I explained to Mrs Margo about the metal and screws, she allowed me to sample a pain cream they have, for several hours that day I was COMPLETELY PAIN FREE!!! For the first time in over 3 years!!!! I bought a bottle of the Water Soluble CBD oil, and took it home to try. As I have used the product I have began to notice that the pain in my face is more manageable, my anxiety hasn\u2019t been nearly as high. Due to other medical issues, there are certain days where pain would keep me from doing ANYTHING AT ALL. It would hurt to breathe or even roll over in bed. Since using this product, I have notice the pain is more manageable, and on days that I would normally just lay in bed and try to lay completely still, I am getting up and doing things like baking cupcakes and making icing from scratch!!! I am a true believer in this product now!!! Give it and Mrs Margo at Your CBD Store in Enterprise a shot! See what it can do for you!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589218880927, "text": "Hi Ashley. Thank you for taking your time to share your experience with others!
