The guy at the counter kept commenting on how expensive it was going to be.... okay, so?... I want my phone fixed and your business does this right...?\n\nWe paid and were told it would take 3 to 5 days for the screen to come in; they would call me and I could come in and have the phone's screen replaced in an hour or so. 10 days pass and no one calls me. My husband calls them and they say the screen is in and I can come in and get it replaced. They then try to call me, but I was unavailable. The next day, he drops the phone off as soon as they open at 10am, and was informed that the only one who could fix it wasn't there yet. He would be there in 45mins and it would take 2hrs to fix the screen. 2 hrs....\n\nMy husband decided to go to the gym, then come home and clean up. He called them at 2pm and my phone was still being worked on: they said give him more time. He arrived there after 3:30pm and the phone was not finished being repaired. Decided to pick up dinner next door. Still not done. So finally, around 4pm it is finished. It works and has a lifetime warranty for the pressure sensitivity. This was one thing I was concerned about: the screen's pressure sensitivity.\n\nI get my phone and inspect it. It was not even sealed properly! Therefore, it is not waterproof anymore, and not resellable. Annoyed, I go to the shop myself and the tech who worked on my phone is very apologetic, admits it was done incorrectly, but is unable to help me. He said he was busy and trying to hurry because my husband had been waiting for a while. Still has a lot of things to work on; I could leave it overnight, come by tomorrow. Maybe it would get done. I can't leave my phone there overnight, and I can't come back the next day. He was going to try and put weight on the phone before taking the screen off and resealing it.\n\nThat is what I'm trying to do now: put weight on it. I wrapped it in screen cleaning cloths and set a gallon water jug on it. About 7 or 8 lbs. I asked him how much weight, but he never answered me, telling me instead about the warranty. The warranty is for the screen's pressure sensitivity.\n\nI'd rather have it take a long time and done correctly, than rushed and crappy. Now, I'm trying to correctly their mistake. I don't think pressing it down with weight will help. It is misaligned somewhere, and not glued and seal properly.\n\nPaid $340 to have my phone's screen replaced and they didn't do it properly. The back part is spongy; you press down and it comes back up. The whole left side was not placed correctly or glued down properly. Would never go here again. And would urge everyone to not waste their time until the people at CPR have better organization and attention to detail. They also seem like they need more knowledgeable people. My husband was told this tech had never worked on a Samsung Note 8 and that one of them only works on computers and laptops; no phones at all.

I was advised instead to purchase a wireless charger elsewhere and a battery from them since mine was weak. I did buy the battery from them and they came from the back with a battery that had no seal or package and sold it to me for $40 and took my old battery, which it would not charge past 20% until I bought a new battery from another location indicating they sold me a used battery as new. What they didn't inform me was that my phone was not wireless charging capable. I went back to try and get a refund but I was never given a receipt and they said they can't do anything about it since they have no records of them selling it to me. Not only am I now stuck with a used battery that was sold as a new but was given false information. I took my business to another phone repair shop that was capable of performing my repair at $65 compared to their quoted $200 and my screen never had to be shattered. I advise not conducting any business with this store if you need anything because you may end up with used parts and misleading information.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1503527530248, "text": "Hi Kyle, I wish you would have contacted us directly regarding this. We would have been happy to explain why this is the way that it is.\n\nThe repair shop that you brought your device to has the capability of micro soldering a new charging port to the existing cable. We do not have that capability which means that we must remove the entire flex cable to change the port. The problem with that is the navigation buttons that are on the phone are sealed under the screen and wrap around to the charge port. Meaning for us to get those out we must lift the screen after heating it substantially. It\u2019s very risky and leads to cracked LCDs in most cases.\n\nWe NEVER want to take advantage of anyone. We set expectations for everything. We would rather you know the entire truth before going with our service.\n\nNow, to the battery. We buy batteries in bulk which do not come in \u201cretail\u201d packaging. We would have gladly given you a full refund on that item if it was not working up to our standards.\n\nAs you can see from most of our reviews, we go above and beyond for our customers. A $40 battery would not be worth losing a customer over.\n\nI will still gladly refund the $40 if you come in and ask for Jessie.\n\nAs I appreciate the feedback I believe a 1 star review isn\u2019t warranted in this case. We just lack the capabilities in making that specific repair cheaper.\n\nThe reality is the explanation you were given is 100% accurate because we would need to replace the screen as well which cost well over $100 just to get it to our shop.\n\nI am happy that you were able to get it fixed elsewhere and for cheaper. We cannot speak to other repair shops capabilities, only our own.\n\nThanks for your consideration and please come see us for your refund.\n\nJessie"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7349200629:0xa1f9cde73259baf4"}

He puts a brand new button on and gives me it back. I get home and try to update my phone through my MacBook and now I get an error 23 message... I google this error message and its an issue with the HOMEBUTTON. I take it BACK to him for a third time and he then tells me I couldn't update my phone with the new button. why does this guy insist on not telling customers important information??? Also, I took it to Ifixit to see if they could fix it and when they took it apart. There were screws and a plate missing in the phone!!!! He was rude, stole my money, and didn't even put parts back in.

He priced a screen and battery for me, but I declined and walked out because he broke my screen and absolutely refused to acknowledge it. I went back to the office, called this place and asked to speak to the manager. He asked what was wrong and I told him about the staff breaking my screen. He reveals that the guy I'm speaking with on the phone is the one who \"helped\" me in the store, and said that he is the manager and owned the store. I calmly explained to him what he did and how I watched him do it right in front of my face. He REFUSED to take responsibility and tried offering a $10 discount for both screen and battery instead. I said no thanks, and to have a nice day before hanging up. I am SO upset - I ended up just buying a new phone since it was about the same cost of what he would charge for a screen and battery.

I tell them that this problem occurred due to the repair work they performed.  The technician tells me that they could not verify the phone was working 100% prior to them working on it so there is nothing they can do to help.  They suggested I do a software update...I do it and after the update my antenna is still messed up.  I understand they couldn\u2019t test it because it was dead and it wouldn\u2019t take a charge.

When you called a month ago, I explained to you that the charging port that controls the charging portion of the phone is part of the motherboard and not something that can be damaged during screen repair as we transfer over the whole motherboard. If it was damaged, it would not have been able to charge at all. I recommended trying a different charger to see if it was a charger issue and if not, bring it by and we would help take a look at it for you. When I didn\u2019t hear back from you, I assumed the problem was resolved.\n\nCharging issues like that are usually caused by charger going bad, broken solder joint on the charging port (caused by accidental bend of charger while plugged in), or sometimes if the battery is going out. So I think it is very unfair to us to give us such a bad review without giving us a chance to look at it and try to resolve the issue with you. Being a small local business, reviews like that can hurt us in a big way.\n\nSo if you can please give us a chance to properly diagnose your phone and resolve this issue, I would really really appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can reach me at our Store phone number (251)665-9888 during business hour.\n\nThank you very much and I hope to hear from you soon"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4cd6e4d39e05:0xe5df27fa39089580"}

Drove 45 miles to their store was told it'd be $300.00 just for parts.  Found another place that fixed it for $85.00 in 45 minutes. I hate being lied to to get business.\nEdit for reply:\nMy wife called Tuesday 1/5/21 and told whoever answered the phone, after telling them my issue (power button on my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus fell off). She was told that it wouldn't be a problem and no appointment needed that it'd be $79.00. As I mentioned before I live 45 miles away, I had to leave work early to make sure I had ample time to get there and to get service.\nYes, you are correct,  there was not a record or service ticket made because the guy there looked at my phone said that I'd have to leave it and that the parts would be $300.00 because the board would have to be changed out that the button was all one unit. I value my time and money as much as everyone else and I left without your service. Yes, I do feel like the initial phone call was a bait and switch just to get someone in the store. You know that $19.99 oil change costs $500 because you need tires,wipers, injector cleaning and \"blinker fluid\". It's just strange that my wife was told one thing and I was told another. I called another shop  told them exactly what was wrong, they said same thing. No problem, no appointment needed.  Took phone, they looked at it and the fixed it for the amount quoted.\nFunny thing that one shop said one thing and the other one did it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610116073880, "text": "Jason, I cannot find a repair ticket or record of your name, are you sure you have the right place? If so, I would like to reach out to you to find out what happened, as we do not give bogus pricing to obtain business. Mistakes do happen and if this indeed did happen, I'd love the chance to make it right!\n\nWe have a proven track record of being transparent throughout our entire repair process and we pride ourselves on having some of the best pricing in the industry. I especially appreciate this review because it gives me a chance to explain our repair process.\n\nBefore I start, i'd like to point out one thing, there is a giant discrepancy between $80.00 and $300.00. The only phone parts that cost this much are some of the Genuine Samsung Display Assemblies. If another shop was able to resolve this for $85.00, it was a small part repair, like a charging port or proxy sensor, for example. (If parts were needed.) My point is, our prices would have been comparable.\n\nWhen a customer calls in to obtain a price on a particular repair we do our best to go over the details of the problem or issue they are experiencing. If we are confident we know the solution to the issue at hand, we then will give you a price or at least a ballpark figure, so they know what to expect. If we are unsure what the solution is to the issue, we will ask you to bring the device in to be diagnosed, before giving you a price on the repair.\n\nThe Process.\n\n1. Once you come into our office, we go over the details of the issue you are experiencing with your device. We will then go over repair solutions or inform you that it will need further diagnostics to obtain the solution to the issue.\n\n2. We then obtain all your contact information and create you a ticket. We may at this time give you a price on the repair. Below are a couple normal situations.\n\n*Lets go over a couple examples, an iPhone 8, the screen is damaged, everything else on the device is working as intended (we verify this,) we give you a price on the display assembly replacement and an ETA for expected completion.\n\n*Now, lets say its a Gaming Computer, it is randomly turning off or blue screening. We will not know what the issue is without diagnosing all the hardware. In this situation, we will inform you that we will need to perform additional diagnostics to know what it will take to repair this device.\n\n3. Once we have obtained the device, we then will start the diagnostics or repair in the order that it came in. We have other repairs in front of new repairs. Your device will go into the queue and will be worked on when its ticket is next. There are two exceptions to this. Most phone screen repairs, if we have the parts on hand (which we do for all iPhones and some Samsungs,) are completed in an hour or less. (Time will vary depending on the particular repair.) The other exception is, we offer a rush service, this service is paid at the time of when you drop off the device. This is paid to have the device worked on immediately, otherwise tickets are worked on in the order they are received.\n\n4. Once the repair or diagnosis is completed, we then will email, text, and/or call you, to go over any final or further details.\n\n5. Pick up your device and pay for the repairs. Once a repair is completed you can come by and pick up your device at your convenience. We also offer payment options, you can pay in person with cash or card, or you can pay your invoice through our online portal.\n\n**One quick notes, due to COVID-19, we are not allowing our customers to wait on repairs in the lobby. They must either drop them off, wait in the their car, or outside of the building.\n\nJason, thank you for allowing us to go over this process with you and potential customers that may be reading this. Feel free to reach out to me, Clint Silver, owner at ProTek. I would love to know what happened and would love the opportunity to make it right. Thank you and as always, thanks for choosing ProTek!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I debated leaving this review because I know how harmful bad reviews can be to a small business. Unfortunately, my experience with ProTek was so disappointing I felt obligated to share.\nWhen replacing my screen ProTek compromised the integrity of my water resistant IPhone XS causing it to be hyper sensitive to moisture. This resulted in my phone being corroded by light water exposure only 3days after the iPhone repair. ProTek then refused to refund me the 200$ for the faulty screen replacement which essentially destroyed my 1000$ phone. Let me be clear that my IPhone had been exposed to water on previous occasions to the screen replacement with no issues. ProTek even assured me that there was no water damage prior to the screen replacement. I had expected to have a better experience with ProTek because I had confidence in their customer reviews. Sadly, I have to say I was dissatisfied with their services. At the very least I hope others will take my experience with ProTek into consideration and proceed with caution in regards to ProTek\u2019s remarkable ineptitude with apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589823914117, "text": "I am very disappointed by this review, i'll explain why. Unfortunately for phones, we are in the warmer months and people like to be on the water and when you're on the water, these type of things will happen. I want to start off by saying that we repair and/or recover data from thousands of water damage devices. When you first brought the iPhone in for a screen replacement it was because you left the iPhone in the rain and it ruined the screen. (We informed the customer that the screen was the only thing damaged by the rain.) We replaced the screen and put a new screen seal on it, (as we do with all repairs.) The phone then came back with standing water inside the device, this amount of water is concurrent with other phones we see that have been submerged into water. The customer asked for a warranty on the screen, unfortunately we cannot warranty water or physical damage. (Simply putting a new screen on this iPhone would not resolve the issue, given the current condition.) In a case like this, with standing water inside the device, we would need to let the water dry (we have tools to speed this process up.) After the water has dried, it will leave corrosion behind, which will need to be cleaned. We would then remove the logic board from the iPhone housing, clean it with our Sonic Cleaner, and then test the device for further component damage. We then would replace the components needed to repair the device. More than likely we could have saved this customers phone, had the customer let us complete the water damage assessment on this device.\n\nPlease remember that iPhone's are not water proof, they are water resistant, and each iPhone has its own water resistance rating. We have seen water damage happen in pretty much every way, from being in your pocket and sweating, to being on the bathroom counter while taking a shower, and to drops in the ocean. Each iPhone handles each exposure differently, because in each exposure, the conditions are different. If you are going to be around water, buy a water proof bag, put your phone into the bag and use it from the outside the bag, only to remove it if you need to make a phone call. This will drastically minimize the chance of water damage. I hope this reply has answered any questions as to how we handle water damaged phones here at ProTek. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want some friendly advice, feel free to contact us at your convenience!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

From a few feet away, they looked legit, but upon further inspection, they were definitely a counterfeit. I sell plenty of Apple products out of my store on a daily basis and have for 5+ years. I can tell just by the fit/finish, packaging, font, etc that these are definitely not a real Apple product, or even a refurbished unit.\n\nFrom what your customer told me, you reassured her that they were a legitimate product, and refused to offer her a refund, only store credit until she threatened to get mall management and the police involved.\n\nShame on you for preying on elderly and unknowing customers trying to get Christmas gifts for their families. She told me she spent the last $90 of her fixed income to get these for her daughter as a late Christmas gift.\n\nYou are selling items under false pretenses and not disclosing the authenticity of the products. Makes me wonder how many other people you have ripped off with this same scam.

A week or so passed and they called and said the part was in. I took my tablet in for repair they said they may not get to it that day because they were busy... understandable. Well I came back late the next day and they said they still haven't got to it and they would leave a note to do it first thing the next day. Well the next afternoon I called and they still didn't have it ready. So a few more days passed and they called and said they had broken the screen and had to order a whole new screen. Told us we had to wait for the tech to get paid because he had to pay for the new replacement parts. It took more than 1 month to get the new parts and for them to finally call us and say it's ready. We get to the store and ask to pick up the tablet and it is in horrible condition the back panel wasn't even put back on properly and had spots where it was raised up enough I could see the internals on the tablet. We refused to take it that time because it was not repaired. We also learned the the money we origanally paid them to fix it was refunded to the tech who had broken the tablet. The employee/tech refused to try to repair the tablet saying \"I'm not going to try to press that together and break that tablet.\" She was referring the the back panel I mentioned was raised up in places. We told her to contact the manager and she pulled out her cell phone called the manager and said \"These people are refusing to take the tablet and I'm so mad I'm about to just walk out\" the manager told her to tell us she would take a look at it tomorrow. A few days passed they called again and said it was ready so we went to get it and it was better condition but still it is very scuffed up on the trim all the way around the screen and the back is still slightly raised up in a few places. We took it anyway out of pure frustration with the employees and the manager. This place is a joke DO NOT take anything here to be fixed or you will regret it. This is the first time I've ever written a review but this place was so bad I felt like I needed to put it out there that this place is not a professional establishment and they treat their customers like garbage after you hand them your money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459787711858, "text": "Hello Ryan  I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.

I took in my iphone 5s for a cracked screen.  Up front they were very confident stating that it would only take about 45 mins and for a somewhat reasonable price.  The first screen they put on they said was \"glitchy\".  The second screen had screws that were so over-tightened they pushed through to the glass.  The third screen worked but somewhere along the way several other items were damaged.  When first checking in the phone they did a thorough checklist noting that everything worked properly.  Now I have a phone that doesn't have a vibrate function anymore, the earpiece only works sometimes, and it drops calls all of a sudden now.  They told me that they aren't sure what is wrong and they will order a part and maybe that will work.  I told them I didn't want anyone else trying to work on my phone anymore (3 different people already messed up different parts of the phone).  I asked for a refund and was told that if they got approval from the district manager, they might be able to install a broken screen  on my phone and give me my money back.

I took in my iphone 5s for a cracked screen.  Up front they were very confident stating that it would only take about 45 mins and for a somewhat reasonable price.  The first screen they put on they said was \"glitchy\".  The second screen had screws that were so over-tightened they pushed through to the glass.  The third screen worked but somewhere along the way several other items were damaged.  When first checking in the phone they did a thorough checklist noting that everything worked properly.  Now I have a phone that doesn't have a vibrate function anymore, the earpiece only works sometimes, and it drops calls all of a sudden now.  They told me that they aren't sure what is wrong and they will order a part and maybe that will work.  I told them I didn't want anyone else trying to work on my phone anymore (3 different people already messed up different parts of the phone).  I asked for a refund and was told that if they got approval from the district manager, they might be able to install a broken screen  on my phone and give me my money back.

Two days ago I took my iPod 5 in to get the screen replaced on it. The home button still worked on it prior to me dropping it off. Once I got my iPod Touch back with the screen repaired my home button no longer worked. Casey, the owner, claimed it to be a result of the damage that occurred to it prior and I had come to found out that it actually was a result of her improperly removing the button. She tore the conductive ribbon strip from the home button that lets it depress and click the dome switch underneath. She claimed that it was not her fault did not offer any kind of apology and told me it was unfixable.

If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  We took an iPad 3 to iFix on December 20th to have a broken screen replaced.  We called later that evening and went to pick it up after they said it was complete.  We tested the iPad while at the store in front of Tyler, an iFix employee, and the power button wouldn't work, the magnetic closure to put the iPad to sleep wouldn't work, and you couldn't lock/unlock the iPad.  They also scratched the body of the iPad around the edges when they replaced the screen.  Tyler made a note of the issues and agreed we could bring the iPad back for repair after the Christmas holiday.  While we had it, the screen detached from the iPad body.\n\nWe took it back to iFix on or about January 9th.  We had to swipe (erase all content) off the iPad for them to repair it, so we had to buy a new one to replace this one in the interim.  We have received NO communication from anyone with iFix since that time unless we've called for a status.  We have called numerous times to speak with the manager, David and Tyler the original employee dealing with us on this.  Each time it's the same story...they're working on it and since that time, David is no longer with them.  I emailed all of the contacts on the Corporate iFix website and never received a response.  The employee we were dealing with, Tyler, can't tell us anything and he said the district manager was now handling our case.\n\nAmber Wells, the District Manager with iFix, and they would not agree to refund the $196.19 we paid for the screen replacement and she said they can't repair it.  I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint in March and iFix never responded to it.  The leasing manager, Rhonda Clark, at Wiregrass Commons Mall has attempted to get this resolved with the owner but has not been successful.  Apparently there are other customers who have complained to the mall management because iFix won't stand behind their work, lack of work, or whatever you wish to call their shoddy attempt at service.\n\nAt the very minimum, they should have refunded what I paid for the repair.  Unfortunately now, I have no confidence that the iPad will ever work the same even if someone else replaces the screen.  PLEASE don't make the mistake of taking any devices to this store.\n\nAs of September 24, 2014 they STILL have my iPad.  Nearly 9 months later and nothing from them...no attempt at resolution at all.  iFixandrepair has yet to contact me.  Apparently they have no interest in resolving the issue.  I'm taking them to small claims court to try to get this resolved.  Again, I would NOT recommend them for repairs of any sort based on my personal experience and the lack of concern of their staff.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462910926173, "text": "Hello Donna I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.
