I boarded my kitty for July 4th weekend; it was her first time being boarded.\n\nWhen I picked her up, she was skeletally thin, which I did not notice until I took her out of her carrier when I got home. Granted, she had lost a little bit of weight before I brought her for boarding, but not a noticeable amount. I had already planned on taking her to the vet as soon as I was back in town, but I was never notified during her time at Pet Palace that she was not eating (it was pretty obvious to me that she had not eaten those 4 days for her to be so skinny). I may have come back sooner to pick her up and take her to a vet or requested that someone drive her to a local vet at my expense. She ended up being diagnosed with Feline Infectious Peritonitis, which you may know is a fatal disease in cats. While I have been able to treat her for it, if we had known even a few days earlier, I would have been able to start treating her earlier, and she may not have been hospitalized for three days or needed a blood transfusion just a couple days after picking her up from Pet Palace.\n\nI am not blaming Pet Palace for giving her FIP; this isn't the case at all. I'm just really disappointed with the lack of communication. I wasn't told even when I picked her up that she had not eaten during her stay. I hope that this is not something that happens to any future kitty parent who boards with Pet Palace.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bac6bbfd9f:0xd521047da28c3f7e"}

I boarded one of my dogs here a few months ago and all was well.\nI have 2 dogs now & needed boarding while we went out of town for a funeral. I called and was told my adult dog could stay w/our puppy in the same kennel For one price, $27. When I dropped them off the same thing was repeated to me as I was contemplating separating the dogs. The girl assured me they would watch them the first day and if there were issues they would separate them and only charge for 2 kennels on the nights they had to be separated.\nI picked them up on Sunday and was told they did great and were together the whole time. However, I was billed for a separate kennel each night. I asked the girl at the desk about it and she also happened to be the one who checked them in, quoted me $27 per night per kennel, not per dog and said she checked with another employee and confirmed they could share for one price. I asked her to call the owner because I didn't feel like you should write one price and charge another at the end. She called Jenny, the owner, and Jenny told her it was $27 per night, per dog. She  called Jenny back so I could speak to her and explain to her what I was told. Jenny saw it was her employee calling and she answered the phone \"Is she giving you trouble? \" I explained to Jenny who I was and what I was told. She talked over me, would hardly let me speak, told me I was confused and no one there would have ever given me those prices... Even though the girl was sitting right there apologizing for giving me the wrong information. She remembered doing it and still thought today that the price was per kennel and not per dog. She told me another employee also thought that. There were also three other customers in the lobby who heard it. I paid the full price but I won't take my dogs back. I've never seen an owner argue with a customer like she did. She was rude and disrespectful, as well as intimidating to her employees. I think her employees are young and just do what they are told.

Auburn AL) this past weekend (06/14/18-06/17/18) for 3 nights and four days, including doggie day camp. WOULD NOT recommend, 0/10. First, they are so busy and understaffed it seems that they don't even take the time to relay any extra charges or changes in charges, they really want to sneak in those extra ridiculous fees. Second, they did not make time for me when I called for an update and were very short and even hung up on me before I was done. Thirdly and MOST IMPORTANTLY my dog came back to me INJURED. She had two symmetrical injuries on the side of her mouth. That they claim to have no knowledge of. They tried to blame my dog and then tried to say I don't know my own dog. It isn't an injury she could really give herself. They claim to have no knowledge of it or not have noticed it but I took her to veterinarian and they said it would have been bleeding and the bleeding on top of the noticeable swelling injuries on her lips would have been very hard to miss. So either they are lying, or they paid absolutely zero attention or care to her. Now she has to be on antibiotics as well as being in pain because of these people and their negligence. I will never come here again and I suggest to anyone who actually loves their pet, not to come here.\n\n*UPDATE*: The manager at Pet Palace called my personal phone number that I had left as my contact number while my dog was staying there, to complain about the honest review I had left of my personal experience. They did refund me for the extra treat charges that were not displayed visually or verbally (they had charged me to give my dog her own treats that I had provided for her and made no mention of it when I told them). They felt that this small action of doing the right thing meant that everything else was fine. She claimed that I was putting false accusations out there. As mentioned above, a licensed vet had told me that the injury would have been bleeding (on her and other things) and swelling (she has white fur, blood and a swollen lip injury like that would definitely be noticeable if you are actually doing your job taking care of the dogs). When I claimed I could not talk because of work and had to go the manager did not want to take no for an answer and continued to try and argue with me about my review being \"wrong\". This is extremely unprofessional of a business to call and complain to a customer for leaving their honest and personal experience online for others to see.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bac6bbfd9f:0xd521047da28c3f7e"}

He required seizure medicines 2-3 times daily and they administered all his medications.  The girls that work there keep in touch as well as the owner and are like family to us because they loved our dog and gave him great care while he was there.  As with all businesses there's always something once in a blue moon that isn't quite perfect, and if we ever brought up anything, like he had a wet tummy one time after camp, obviously not their fault, as our dog LOVED water and probably dumped his bowl, but they apologized and dried him off right away so that he didn't get the car all wet.  They could have just brought us a towel, but they blow dried him so he was nice and dry.  Taking care of something like that makes me respect the business even more when they handle issues with a smile and make sure you are satisfied.

Their prices were much higher than I normally pay, but decided to give them a chance since they were new and closer to my house. DO NOT DO IT! This was a horrible mistake and I left crying. My Bassett Hound was a little difficult for them to get out of the crate. When I picked him up, he didn\u2019t even look like he was given a bath or brushed. There was tons of lose hair I had to brush off when we got home and he still had stuff in his eyes. When I went back to pick up my schnauzer, I had already paid their hefty fee. My bill was $97. They brought him out shaved except for his tail. Not only is this not how a schnauzer is suppose to be cut, he has places there is still long hairs and places he\u2019s down to the skin. When I asked about why they shaved him, I could not get a straight response. The receptionist said that\u2019s all we could do and the groomer said that\u2019s what the receptionist told me. They were not at all apologetic and rude about their mistake.

I explained to your husband during drop off, it might be around closing time before he would be ready, and he was fine with that.\nWe try our best to accommodate all of our clients accordingly, and provide loving care for your pets as if they were our own. Sometimes that means we have to spend a little more time with nervous or scared ones, which often means we are working past closing. We apologize for the confusion, but what our staff was trying to say when you called was that even though we technically close at 5pm, we stay until the job is done. We always tell our clients to feel free to call and check in, however we will text when ready finished. We have several clients that travel from different areas and if we know at check in, we can get those pups done first.\n\nShaggy Chic operates differently than most other salons. We allow for a fun and enjoyable experience for the pets that come in, instead of sitting in kennels all day. Because of this unique service, and our goal of providing a high quality groom for each individual pet, our finishing time varies.

Our goal is to provide the best experience possible for each pet and their family when coming to Shaggy Chic. With this being said, when you first started coming to Shaggy Chic, I remember going above and beyond to configure a special discounted rate based on you bringing all 15 dogs in for grooming. After agreeing on this price, we have only ever seen 6 out of 15. Out of the 6, only 4 were brought in more than once. No other client has received special discounted rates for having multiple pets,  however, I made an exception for your family. I simply can not be expected hand out discounts for owning multiple pets. We are still doing the same amount of high quality care to each individual pet, and I still have to pay my staff. Let me also say that we have never given any client a hard time when asked if we could change something about their pet's hair cut. Every client has their own vision of how they want their pet groomed, and we always do our best to comply with each unique style...  As for me not returning phone calls, I am a very busy person running a small business and also grooming dogs full time. This is why I have a receptionist to answer the phones and schedule appointments. It is unfair to say that just because I have not had a moment to return a phone call, that means we have \"bad business ethics\". My receptionist has been more than willing to answer any question you may have, as well as schedule a grooming appointment. However, you have refused to discuss with her.

If by settled your mean the check your insurance paid out 4 weeks later that covered the em regency vet and ONE of many of our vet follow ups than yeah guess \u201csettled\u201d in eyes of the law. Also by Alabama state law you would have been better off killing him in your carebecause unfortunately as of now Alabama state law classified him as a possession and worth retail price. But we just want to know WHAT HAPPENED!!!  I\u2019ve done my research this will go away once I find out what happened to our sweet baby. And everything I have stated is factual. Did happen and have all the proof. Contact me and tell me what happened and I\u2019ll remove review. Even though you should be shut down for allowing something like this to happen on YOUR watch.\n\nAdded a photo of him leaving emergency vet.\nStill no idea how it happened.\n\nUpdate: 8 months later our dog still having comlpications from injuries sustained here. Hope she\u2019s done something to help protect little dogs because we still have no idea what happened. It not about the money tonya. We want to know what happened to our little guy. I pray this never happens again to another dog.\n\nDogs stayed 8 hours. Got back with 3 broken ribs!!!!\nWe dropped off our pups on 9-19-18. Dropped them off at 8:30 am. Well finally at 6 pm we go to get them and one is acting weird. Took him to emergency vet. Long story short he had 3 broke ribs on left side and trauma to eye and face on right side. Nicely asked Tonya about what happened and I don\u2019t know is the only answer we got. She has cameras but of course apparently did not work on that day but they do now. Spoke with her nicely multiple times. Well her insurance paid our claim but only for medical expenses and denied the reimbursement for the groom because Tonya the owner denied to them anything had happened. So when I got frustrated 3 weeks later I went to the place and let her know I was frustrated without yelling or cussing like I wanted to do from day one but did not. Next thing I know cops are there bc her helper called saying she was scared for her life. I have all of this on audio record. If anything Tonya yelled at me when I calmly stated would go public if did not give me my money back bc something happened to my dog in her care. Today is oct 15. We got ins check but no reimbursement from Tonya. Just asked her about it and was told to quit harassing her. Well to this day we still don\u2019t know what happened. But something did because when we left the dog was fine at 8:30 A.M. and picked up at 6pm he was not. Dog was in constant agonizing pain for over week and half. Our vet is the only reason he got any relief until healed because she would sedate him for us. If he wasn\u2019t sedated he laid down staring off in space constantly crying. We\u2019ve used this groomer for 3 years. Don\u2019t think she would intentionally hurt any animal but the fact is he got hurt while in her care and this whole process is completely unprofessional and cannot believe we are getting treated how we are when it\u2019s my dog that has had something happen to him under someone\u2019s else\u2019s care. I\u2019m sorry Tonya but \u201c I don\u2019t know\u201d is not acceptable when you are dealing with people\u2019s animals. Even though apparently I\u2019ll recieve a law suit for writing this. People need to be aware of what dangers could happen. An animal is a piece of property in the eyes of Alabama state law. Unless you have video evidence you are lucky to get medical bills paid back to you. Never leave your animal at any groomer. Especially a big chain. Thought we were safe dealing with someone we thought we could trust. Will never make that mistake again.\nThank you Tonya for a wonderful experience.

We were so busy and lost track of time! I was clear across town at the time, and when I got ahold of Chris he was leaving right then to get him. He picked up Bailey at 4pm, and apologized several times for any inconvenience! Poor Bailey was shaking like a leaf! Chris said he was so scared!! \ud83d\ude22Well if you know Bailey- this is not him!! His tail wags a mile a minute! He loves people, and especially when he sees one of us! The lady then charged Chris and extra 20.00 and told him maybe next time they would be on the same page for pickup time. \ud83d\ude21\nThis is the FIRST time we have ever been late to pickup Bailey, EVER! And worse- I must have sent her at least 10 referrals in the last few years! I'm so mad, and so sad for Bailey. I'm not sure what that lady meant by \"next time\" cause that was surely our last!\n\nI am in no way justifying that is okay that we were late to pick him up. But we run a small business as well, and there is no way we would ever treat a customer that way, that was late to pick up.\n\nShe has also now offered a full refund and told me to get a new groomer- however, my concern lies in why she would give a full refund, if she didn't do something WRONG! :(", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212bbe2fcea85:0xe8c8a7934fdae349"}

First, they told me that \u201cdue to covid\u201d I would have to place my dog in this little kennel that didn\u2019t even have a solid bottom so I\u2019m sure it was hurting his feet. I then go over to the counter and they proceed to show me a piece of construction paper that has what looks like pieces of a rug glued on with numbers written in sharpie and there were only 4 blade length options. Most other places I\u2019ve been show you what seems to be an endless option for lengths. I pick the one I like the best and tell them. They couldn\u2019t give me a time because they said it depended on how easy the dogs were to groom. The price also went up if the dog was difficult to groom. I leave and get a call around 1ish saying my pup is ready. There was a sign that said they begin to charge after the first 30 minutes I believe after they call. It\u2019s seems like they are doing anything they can to get some money. I show up and my dog is still in the kennel and I go and get him. He practically jumped into my arms, crawling up my chest. I go over to the counter and pay just to get him home. I got home and began looking at him and he was all choppy and messy. There we\u2019re places that looked like they had gotten too close and we\u2019re almost bleeding and places where he was just so choppy. I also noticed when I got in the car THEY DID NOT BATHE HIM!!! Hair was flying everywhere, and come to find out their \u201cbath\u201d is spraying the dog with dog perfume. We went back up there the next day and explained to them who we were and what had happened and the lady was extremely rude and wouldn\u2019t give us ANY of our money back and blamed all of the places where he was skinned up on \u201chair disease\u201d (we take him to the vet regularly, HE DOESN'T HAVE HAIR DISEASE).\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going there again and don\u2019t advise you to take you\u2019re dog there either.

Although I do wish you had posted a TRUE review.   Yes, we do have a cagebank in the lobby so that we. An have no human contact for your safety and ours.  This is what was required for us to reopen after the shut down.   Your baby was immediately taken out as soon as you left and the lobby was empty so that we could enter and taken straight to the tub for his bath.  You were told in advance that we groom them in the order they arrive and thst we'r woukd call you when he was finished.  There were several others that had arrived before you did.  Once your dog was finished, he was placed back into the lobby for you to pick him up and you were immediately called.  When you arrived,  the first words out of your mouth was how good he looked.  You were not charged any thing extra from the base price you were quoted.  You were simply told when quoting a price on the phone that thst was the base price provided he was not extremely matted, have fleas, or behavior thst made it take a lot longer to do the groom.   You  did not come back the next day.   Your grandmother did and told me you woukd not come.   She showed me a couple of small spots that I had no problem fixing while she was there, but all she kept saying was that you needed a refund because you needed the money for your trip.  I smelled the dog and condemned thst he smelled good (she agreed) but I also offered to rebath him.   Yes there was a small red spot  where he probably had a little clipper rash.  I  told her I could make a note not to cut as short there nwxt time because he was probably a bit more sensitive than other dogs.   (Have no idea where the words \"hair disease\" came from.)  Anyway, I was as polite as I could be the whole time.   I offered to fix what you didn't like if the hair cut.   I offered to bathe him again and I also offered a discount on your next groom.   But all your Grandmother kept saying was that you needed a refund because you needed the money for your trip.  And that if I didn't refund your money you woukd be giving me a bag review.  I  spent time grooming your dog and had no problem fixing what you were complaining about.

He was basically shaved to where I could see bald spots and cut and left with scabs for a week.  He was not even a year old when this happened. It was his first time to be groomed.  They even called me before I picked him up to warn me that the cut was probably not the best because HE acted out and continued to charge me even so.\nOf course his hair has grown and his scabs long gone, it was time to try again so I found Sudsy Buds and nervously made the appointment.  They were so very kind on the phone and from the very beginning and throughout the process.  When we first arrived, he was very nervous.  The owners came and crouched down to his level and loved on him for a good while and I could tell he was fine by the time I left for work leaving him  in their care.  They texted pics during the process and in all the pics he looked very relaxed and had his signature smile on.  The venue is VERY CLEAN!!  I loved the folks there and when I picked him up he was cut  exactly how I asked them to cut him, no bald spots or cuts like the other facility, and was not upset at all, just tired from his day at the spa  haha!!

I will not get into the details but let me say this about Petagree Pet Center.\nYou are not treated as a customer, a client, a number or even just a client.\nYou are treated as a human being.\nSomeone that has been through what they themselves may have gone through.\nEmpathy, respect, encouragement and just good old-fashioned manners. Something severely lacking in our world today.\nNeedless to say, they gave me a little pick me up on a week I have desperately needed a win. When your grooming center not only does an outstanding job on my King Charles Cavaliers but also restores faith in humanity and helps to get you through the week. You cannot help but continue to go there.\nToday I returned there to express my thanks and was welcomed with open arms. They will take care of your animals like they are family.\nThey do an amazing job grooming.\nI have spoken to several people that take their animals there for kenneling and love it. I will not take my boys any place else. In my opinion they are the best grooming facility I have ever had. They are also one of the top places of business in the Huntsville/Madison area, they remember you, treat you kindly and take their time with you if you have any questions.\nProfessional.\nCourteous.\nKind.\nOn Time.\nLoves all animals.\nGreat people, Great business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625270874896, "text": "We are so happy you and the boys are back in our area.

I spoke with a woman on the phone who said they treat the dogs like family, they let them out a lot to play, use the restroom and treat them the way you would at home. Well I thought that they would be in good hands because the people seemed to genuinely care. Even when I dropped off my pups the establishment was clean and the people seemed extremely nice.

I don\u2019t believe that the inside of the dog runs had any heaters attached to them. Also, both dogs smelled absolutely horrid and I noticed that their paws were red and they wouldn\u2019t stop licking them. Once I got home I gave the dogs a bath and observed them through the rest of the day until I could get an appointment for my Veternarian on Monday. When I took them to the vet, both dogs have ear infections and have mange on their feet. I know my dogs were healthy before being boarded and I am really upset that they came back with all these problems. It makes me furious at how they were treated. I paid around $300 for my dogs to be taken care of and not have to take them to the vet after and spend $400 there for someone else\u2019s negligence.

I asked for the \u201cYorkie Cut\u201d around her face and for her body to be shaved down to a 5 (they have a nifty numbered chart with a faux fur that you can see and feel for different lengths - it was helpful).\n\nSince we are new, we filled out paperwork and a release form and they took her back.\n\nHer hair looks great, they did an excellent job trimming the fur everywhere (around her bottom, paws and eyes too!) and her coat looks even, shiny, and bright.\n\nThe staff was very sweet and made sure to answer any questions I had ahead of time. And I got a text when she was ready for pick up!\n\nOne thing to note - don\u2019t let the size of this shop fool you! They\u2019ve got loyal and dedicated repeat customers. Get there earlier for drop-off services. I got there on a Saturday at 9:02 AM and there were already a handful of families waiting!  Would recommend.

However, because of his lack of care and negligence we ended up in the ER vet spending $1000 when it would have been a much cheaper fix in his office had he just taken the time to run the appropriate tests.  Even when I called to tell him about the ER visit he never called back, which again only shows how little he cares about the health of his patients.

I said \"Oh no thats okay- I knew it was a last minute thing I was kinda wondering if you had a cancellation or had any downtime today.\" She SCOFFED at me on the phone and said \"TWO NEW DOGS? TODAY?\" Now please keep this in mind- I have ALREADY STATED nicely and VERY upbeat that I realized it was last minute and such an inconvenience to expect her to see me today. ALSO KEEP IN MIND that one of my dogs is less than 5 pounds and the other is 15 pounds. BOTH would have just needed shaves. But listen guys, Dogs aside, shaves aside, it was her lack of professionalism that got me.

Again, we are very sorry this happened during Chopper\u2019s visit to Lucky Dog back in January. It is never a good day when a pup goes home with a boo boo. We strive to be as gentle and safe with the pets in our care as we can, but unfortunately, sometimes these things do happen and it breaks our hearts. You did fail to mention, though, that your Schnauzer is a puppy, was in for his first ever haircut and had barely been handled prior coming here. This, of course, does not excuse the incident, but it does give context to the situation. Schnauzers get a very short blade on their heads and Chopper was in the process of having his head shaved when he jerked in reaction to a sound in the salon causing his groomer to lightly graze the edge of the top of his ear. Our Salon Manager handled Chopper\u2019s service and her incident rate was zero for the last year until this happened for which she was upfront and honest with you about and you told us you understood and even re-booked your next appointment. It was an incredibly minor nick as her reflexes are quick and it did not bleed. Again, we are very sorry that this happened to Chopper. We take things like this very seriously as it hurts us to see it happen, too. No groomer ever wants to accidentally injure a dog while in their care, but again, unfortunately, it is a trade risk when working with wiggly animals, especially puppies, and surgically sharpened equipment. Again, we deeply apologize and hope that you\u2019ll reconsider letting us take care of Chopper in the future. Additionally, I urge you to compare our reviews to those of the salon you recommended. You\u2019ll find they too have incidents happen and yours is our first complaint since we\u2019ve been open. Thanks again for your feedback. \u2764\ufe0f"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889159a6a1efbd1:0x684b11aa61d529a9"}

This disrespectful vet had our Lab, who had been our family pet for 12 years, for the entire day. Somehow between keeping our dog for 8 hours, charging us 400$ just for bloodwork and X-rays, he failed to notice the 5 pound tumor on our dogs spleen. The tumor caused our dogs spleen to rupture in which we took to another vet in town, who was amazing and their entire staff treated us with the upmost respect and professionalism. They had to do emergency surgery for which our pup didn\u2019t make it. Aside from overcharging us, and missing the key diagnoses for the situation, he was extremely disrespectful and unprofessional to my wife and I. His passive aggressive, sarcastic remarks all of which regarding money, were almost overwhelming. Not to mention that he didn\u2019t even send any meds home with us to help my dog. Neither myself nor anyone I know in our community will be using this vet ever again. He really needs to do some self reflection and learn how to be respectful and professional all the way around.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607195277424, "text": "Mr. Burgamy,\nWe were perplexed by your scathing review because as you left our office on Monday, Nov. 30th you thanked us repeatedly for all we had done and assured Dr. Johnston and the rest of the staff that Cooper would be returning the next day for the free treatment that had been offered. We were even more surprised by the hostile text from your father that was sent to Dr. Johnston after hours. Thankfully, your father was willing to answer our phone calls and understood our position. It has come to my attention that you may have heard a briefing between the vet and staff, which is often much blunter than the conversation between a vet and the client by necessity. Unfortunately, I believe that this misunderstanding may be the source of this perplexing review. Our staff would never speak to a client in the same manner as they do to each other as we understand that clients do not handle these situations on a regular basis. All conversation that has taken place between you and the staff at Pike Animal has been compassionate and courteous up to this point.\nI would like to assure you that our staff does not bring up money unless asked to do so by the client. We did everything in our power to help you and Cooper. I would like to remind you that we did not only offer ICU care for Cooper, which was declined, we also offered 7 days of free out-patient treatment which was also declined. We highly doubt that your other vet offered any free treatment for Cooper.\nIn veterinary medicine, there are many variables. Cooper presented as a 12-year-old Lab who could not walk; therefore, we were searching for hip dysplasia. Dr. Johnston informed you gently that as we ran more tests more health issues would be found due to Cooper\u2019s age and pre-existing health conditions. Once initial diagnostic testing had been run, Dr. Johnston did inform you that Cooper\u2019s prognosis for recovery was poor. Pike Animal Hospital and Dr. Johnston do not make these calls lightly and run every diagnostic test necessary before coming to this kind of conclusion.\nOur heart goes out to you for the loss of your beloved pet. It is unfortunate that you cannot find it in your heart to see things clearly at this time and have chosen to accuse Pike Animal Hospital of any form of neglect or misdiagnoses when so much was offered to you in kindness. We have attempted to reach out and extend our condolences as well as hear your feedback and try to put to rest any miscommunications, however, we have been met with no response. It is regrettable that you misunderstand the situation and this review is all the more disappointing. Each case presented to us is different and as such we must customize treatment accordingly, which we attempted to do for Cooper and would have been able to do better had he returned for further treatment. Please bear in mind that Pike Animal Hospital did everything we could for Cooper. Cooper was a fine dog who the staff here at Pike Animal Hospital, especially Dr. Johnston, grew to love in his short time here. We would like to offer our condolences and hope that you will be grateful for the love and memories Cooper bestowed instead of looking for someone to blame for his loss."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

Dr. Johnston was truly over the top in his care of our baby who\u2019s surgery was a great Success!!! Removal of 2 Kidney stones.

I lost a Toy Poodle that I was told had pyometra and needed to be spayed immediately. I took her in and she was extremely sick. I went to visit her, and they had her in the boarding runs, surrounded by barking dogs. I asked for her to be moved to a more quiet place, so they moved her to the cat room. A couple of days later, I came to visit her again, and they had her in a \"parvo\" kennel that was being used for storage. She died shortly after that visit.\n\nA couple of years later, I brought a Heeler in because she was throwing up. Same scenario--pyometra. They spayed her and her health continued to decline. After a few days, she was stable enough to come home. When my husband got there to pick her up, Dr Johnston said she \"crashed\" when he took her IV out. A couple of days later, the doctor recommended that we euthanize her.\n\nI came in to pay my $1200 bill and pick up my dog's ashes,  and the doctor didn't even bother to talk to me. The young man at the desk apologized and hugged me. Then he handed me a stained pillowcase with a plastic bag full of ashes. I couldn't even get a list of procedures that they did on my Heeler.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to be able to write this review. Look around the clinic when you go in. There are used needles laying on counters and the place needs to be deep cleaned. The exam rooms are full of junk, so he uses the exam table in the middle, where the public has no business going.\n\nI've been to a lot of vet clinics, and have worked at a couple. This one is sad.

Since you have chosen to remain anonymous and this event occurred years ago, I have little recollection of the specific details. I do, however, remember you said you previously worked in vet clinics before. You were shown that my equipment is constantly upgraded and all approved treatment protocols were followed. You must still be grieving to write a scathing one star review so long after the event occurred. My heart goes out to you. I would have met you at the door with your ashes had I known you were here.\nI am also very sorry that you did not have your dogs spayed. That would have prevented the deadly pyometra, not the lack of a \"deep cleaning\" which all but brand new clinics require. To ensure transparency, we do encourage clients to watch us work on their pets in our treatment area. All treatment areas have surgical instruments and needles in them. If a client does not care to watch, they always have the option to wait in the lobby. Since the time of your visit we have an entire new staff. I have shown them your review in an effort to reemphasize the importance of client communication, compassion, cleanliness, and grief management. Sometimes during upgrades to our facility, we regrettably must utilizes all the storage space including the exam room and isolation ward. Sounds like you caught us at a very busy time and we made some mistakes in those areas, but unfortunately those things could not have prevented the tragic outcome. All animals I see get the best care I can provide. Tragically, they do not all survive and I have as much trouble accepting that as you  do.\nI have been practicing for 30 years now. Losing a patient gets hard every year. Online reviews are new to me. I take them all personally and would much rather speak in person. I am very accepting and open to constructive criticism.  As you can tell by the vast majority of my reviews, that my cherished clients are pleased. I know it is impossible to please everyone and save every pet, but I do try my hardest. It breaks my heart to know how you must feel to write this review after a loss so long ago. Again, I am sincerely sorry you are still grieving and I am hurting too.\nMy very best regards."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

I am really torn their other location is good but they both are owned by the same company or corporation so they stay in business no matter what location you.

The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent. This facility is anything but transparent!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb344b45a6c63:0x685d3a5c7b681a37"}

Shaking, limping and handed dirty bedding with no explanation as to how he was injured, why we weren't informed  when it happened plus finding out he'd been very stressed by being kenneled every night in the large room with the large dogs with big dog barks! When I first boarded @ Piper's 2 years ago I requested that he be kenneled at night with only little dogs and was shown a room off the hall on the right where I was told the small dogs stayed. When I asked why he was put in the big room this time with the big dogs she said \"well, you didn't request that he be separated\". If my file had been consulted I'm sure it would reflect my wishes. There was no I'm sorry we didn't contact you about his injury, etc. He literally had to be carried that night and Christmas day every time to potty, to food bowl, etc. While I understand this may not be the norm @ Piper's, ( had never happened to me before) since it happened this time, I'll be making other arrangements next time. Beware. Things are not always as they seem. Ask to see where your dog will be put at night. I was told they  NEVER allow tours! That's shocking! I've ALWAYS toured where I board my dog. Ask what their policy is if your dog becomes injured or sick. I asked when the owner would be there as I wanted to speak in person with them and was told the owner was never at the Anniston location.

They treated our cat's chronic and severe UTI and he hasn't had one in 2 years; where as at the other vet we felt like he was not being fully treated and was having unnecessary testing for his diagnosis. In Sept. 2013 we noticed that our dog was not acting like herself and it was after hours, so we took her to the ER vet and they misdiagnosed her with gastritis. We took her to Dr. Price the next day because she had gotten severely worse. Within minutes he diagnosed her with an IMHA, which is a very serious, usually fatal, diagnosis. He sat down with me and explained the disease and treatment course. He stayed with her through the night while she received a blood transfusion, to ensure that she didn't have a reaction to it. He even called me late that night to give me an update. Now nine months later she is her perky self. I would never trust my pets to anybody but Oak View!

A year old border collie mix of some sort, who knows? I did my research looking for a vet and asked my friends who they recommended. Oak View came up multiple times so eventually i decided Oak View would be Max and mine's vet. I could not have been happier with the choice. They helped me take my firsts steps as friend and pet owner and made both of us feel like we were part of the family.\n\nMax didn't have his first seizure until 3 months after i adopted him. Oak View walked me through the different reasons a dog can have a seizure and laid out a plan to help moderate or even eliminate Max's seizures. Had Max's condition been epilepsy or even one of the many normal conditions that can cause seizures i can honestly say Oak View would have been able to help him. Through the empirical method we tried everything to help Max. Unfortunately Max's grand mal seizures persisted and i lost a piece of my friend after each one. Dr. Price and Dr. Robinson admitted that this may be beyond their scope and I respect them all the more for it. I took Max to Neurologists, pathologists, and almost every specialist at Auburn and in between. No one could put a finger on it.\n\nWithin a year my friend was no longer himself. Oak View helped with his final moments and the level of caring and comfort they provided i will never forget. Thank you Oak View. I can never thank you enough for the love and support you gave Max and me.\n\nIf you are debating what Vet to use i highly recommend Oak View.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1455550971601, "text": "Our sympathies on your loss - you worked hard to help him with his seizures and issues.

He\u2019s running a fever between 103-105.3, lethargic, no appetite, and not drinking. We\u2019ve been to the ER vet for the fever when it got to 105.3. He\u2019s been to his normal vet and they have no idea what\u2019s making him so sick. We\u2019ve been given antibiotics and his fever still won\u2019t go down. My dog became this sick after taking him here. I don\u2019t know if another dog they let in had something that was given to mine or maybe the food and water bowls weren\u2019t properly cleaned.

I was at first very happy with pet suites and their services when they first opened. But they\u2019ve grown so much too fast and without the proper staff to take care of your pet. They are too short staffed and are too overwhelmed, frustrated, and not communicating with one another well. I once left him for day care and asked if they could\nfeed my dog breakfast which they\u2019re response was that it was a $29 fee. They didn\u2019t feed him the entire day and would rather have him not eat for 8 hours over $29. Over the weekend that I boarded him they allowed me to pay the \u201cgold package\u201d when he was already approved for group play. They lied about sending photos as part of the package when I asked about it they said they had to \u201cshift through the photos\u201d before sending them but I never received them. When I went to go finally pick him up after receiving no word about him there was a woman in the group play area walking away from the dogs, shooing them, and yelling them to get away from her. It\u2019s one woman and several dogs so I understand she\u2019s overwhelmed but this is clearly a staffing issue. On a tour of the area before leaving my dog therein on the morning of our trip the cages had not been cleaned out and were dirty. I asked for a refund and they refunded me the price I paid for the gold package. I got my dog back tired and not happy.

We recently purchased one, Ramos, from  Germany.  After about  6 weeks here,  he developed a case of bloat that could have killed him.  With bloat, the stomach actually \"flips over\" and cuts the blood supply off to the stomach, causing a rapid distension, and death if not treated quickly.  Fortunately, Ramos' stomach flipped back without emergency surgery.\n\nNot wanting to go through this again, we researched bloat and found the best \u201ccure\u201d for it is a laparoscopic assisted gastropexy.  In this procedure the dog's stomach is sutured to the abdominal wall. The sutures eventually dissolve but the stomach is held permanently in place by an \"adhesion\" preventing recurrent \"flipping\".  Many animal hospitals do not have a laparoscope or the skill to accomplish this procedure.  Dr. Daniels was able to take care of this surgery and Ramos is 99% normal after five days. He has personally checked on Ramos 4 times on his own time since surgery.\n\nEverything about Drs. Daniels and Clark, and their clinic and team  was strictly professional, yet courteous and friendly.  We can't forget Cassidy, the glue and the center of their clinic.  Exceptional personality and warmth!\n\nIf you are looking for a superior team to take care of your special \u201cfamily member\u201d, consider Dr. Daniels and Clark at Nall Daniels Animal Hospital in Homewood.\n\nNot close enough for you?

The first time I took him for his annual shots and a check up I asked about the small lumps on his body and they said it was nothing. 6 months ago I took him to this office to get a check up because we had some concerns. After paying hundreds of dollars for tests and x-rays, they assured me that there was nothing usual going on with my dog. This week he started getting very sick, and after a trip to a different vet, we found out he had cancer and it was very prolonged and caused other problems like anemia, kidney failure and lesions on his lungs. This kind of progression doesn't happen in 6 months. It happens over years. He had been coming here for years and they never once said anything about the cancer that was all over my dog's body and covering his organs. At this point, he was in too much pain, couldn't eat or drink, and could hardly breathe. The new vet and I decided it was best to put him down so he wouldn't be hurting anymore. After years of coming to the same office they never said anything remotely close to cancer.\n\nThere is nothing I can do for my dog anymore, but there is still something you can do for your's. DO NOT bring your animals to this office. There is no way a cancer this severe goes unnoticed for so long with an office that provides quality care. Find somewhere to take your pets that won't treat them like they treated my dog.

Nall-Daniel\u2019s provides a variety of veterinary services including well pet check ups, grooming, surgery, and prescriptions. We went there for our yearly check up and vaccinations for our two dogs; a senior Golden Retriever, and a six year old mutt. The entrance was very clean and clam. When we got called back, we were in a decent sized examination room with a vet tech, I can\u2019t remember his name, but he was a very kind and patient young man with brown hair. He was very thorough with us; he listened to and answered all of our questions. He even provided us with a printed out quote of what all the shots, the visit, and the treatment for the ear infection that our Golden had, before performing any procedures. Then, Dr. Dunaway came in to examine them. She immediately got down in the floor and started loving on the boys. You could see her passion for animal care when she came in the room. She was very articulate and detail oriented, laying out all of the treatment options for the ear infection and recommending medication for his arthritis, too. Her bedside manner was impeccable and I felt listened to and informed as she explained everything that she was doing. We never felt rushed, even as it got near closing time. All in all, it was a wonderful experience. I had called fifteen clinic before choosing this one. The reason I chose them in the first place was because they were one of the most affordable. Sometimes, affordability comes at the expense of the quality of care, but not here. I could tell they genuinely cared about the well being of our animals, and I think that we have found a lifelong vet! I can not recommend them enough!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889196445ac9b45:0x5fdd04c549e75a42"}

I had recently made Nall Daniels my vet and had only needed to bring my dog in a few times before she died.  Although the prices are not low (comparable to other vets, but all are high these days it seems!) the care she received was excellent, the staff was very friendly, and every time I brought her in I received calls to check on her in a day or two.  When I brought her in a week ago, I knew it was probably going to be time to put her down.  She was suffering and could no longer walk.  The staff at Nalls Daniel couldn't have been more kind, caring, gentle, thoughtful, and patient with me and my family.  They made the process as personal and easy as it could be made.  They took good care of my dog and of me until the end.  They were respectful of me and my wishes during this heartbreaking time.\nToday I returned from a luncheon to find beautiful flowers waiting on my porch in memory of Mini from the staff at Nalls Daniel.  I am overwhelmed at their kindness.  Thank you, Nalls Daniel, for caring for my sweet furry friend... and for caring for my heart today as I've been missing her so much.  <3", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889196445ac9b45:0x5fdd04c549e75a42"}

However we would like to clear up a few discrepancies about your visit. Your dog was scheduled to be dropped off at 8am, which you called to see if your boyfriend could drop off early which we accommodated.  Your dog was scheduled to be ready between 2 and 3 pm, however due to heavy matting, thunderstorms and constant calling to find out the status of your dog\u2019s groom we were unable to meet that deadline.  Our records indicate that we called you to let you know your dog was ready for pick up at 3:09 pm today, our records also indicate that you called 7 times beginning at 10:30 am during your dog\u2019s groom and your grandfather called 1 time.  See a dog does not sit still for us to groom them just because we ask it to so we groom each dog a little at a time so we do not stress your dog out during their visit.  We try our best to meet the time frame that we give you for a pick up time, however, when they are heavily matted or if the weather is bad it affects the time it takes to groom your dog.   While we are very accommodating and allowed your boyfriend to drop off and pick up your dog, if you would like to ensure the groom better meets your expectations at your next groomer please be present at drop off or pick up to explain the details of the groom you would like.  We understand that you were not happy with the outcome of this visit and would not want you to have the same experience at your next groomer."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889c93c60afed79:0xe3391b98f01f04d4"}

I always thought she enjoyed it as she seemed excited to pull up and be dropped off. At around a year old, I started noticing a lot of staff turnover at the facility. Although I should have taken heed, I did not and my dog continued to attend day care regularly. I began noticing that my dog was very timid of the staff. In particular, she was called by one of the managers/trainers and immediately backed up, tail between her legs, and laid down in a submissive position behind me. This time I took note and my dog never returned to the facility. I still have pre-paid day care days that will go unused. When I inquired about my dog\u2019s reaction, it was explained to me by staff that my dog was regularly kept separate in a kennel in the back during the day. AND, that her \u201ctraining\u201d involved being taken into the yard, on a leash, while other dogs were allowed to approach her and she was given commands to obey. THIS RUINED MY DOG. She has dog aggression issues to this day, largely due to her extreme anxiety which I believe was engrained into her at a developmental stage while at JHH. Please do not take your dog to this facility for daycare.\n\nAlso, please note that most of the favorable reviews were posted at least a year ago.

I moved to Birmingham a few months ago and did not know a soul. I came for graduate school with my best friend (Oliver) and the center of my world. I shopped around for daycares like my peers do for their human children. I chose Just Happy Hounds because the staff was friendly and I loved how my dog was always playing. He does not spend hours alone in a kennel like he would at home. They have far exceeded my expectation for customer service and outright exceptional care for my puppy. Oliver had a scratched cornea from playing a little hard and required surgery. I was stressed about what to do. I thought I could not take him to daycare while he recovered for surgery. He required extensive medications and needed to watched more closely in the cone of shame. The JHH team took care of Oliver post-op just as well as I would have at home. I never have to worry about my best friend while I am at work/class all day. I know he is being loved and played with as he is at home. I could not be more thankful for such incredible care of Oliver during his time of extra need. As a nurse, I am always caring for everyone else.

Having to wait on them while already late for a flight is not good.\n\nThen, after using them for all that time, the last time I picked up my dog, they informed me that I was not welcomed back. Stella had evidently scratched a door jamb or otherwise did some damage to her room.

Unfortunately, I failed to inform Classy Pup, and missed my appointments.\n\nI called this morning, Monday April 13th, and I apologized and tried to explain the predicament I was placed in on Saturday. Whomever I spoke with was extremely rude, and would not let me finish speaking without overpowering and overwhelming the conversation. She at some point mentioned I\u2019m required to pre pay for both dogs (mind you I\u2019ve never used their service and don\u2019t know how I feel about prepaying), as well as for the appointments I missed? Because I didn\u2019t give them a 24 hour notice? My mother fell ill the evening before the appointments were scheduled, it would be impossible to give a 24 hours notice for this.\n\nIt was all very bizarre, and confusing. I\u2019ve used the same groomer for five years, and she recently went out of business and moved states; I\u2019m certain I can find another groomer to take care of my dogs\u2019 needs, but it\u2019s shameful Classy Pup is so tone deaf and belligerent.

You spoke with me the owner.  As I remember our conversation it was several days after your appointment you called to make another one.  No mention of your mothers illness and a very lighthearted  attitude about your missed appointment.  That is a huge deal to a small business, being that we had a hole of 2.5 blocked off hours in our schedule due to your dogs not coming in. Businesses cannot operate that way! And it was an appointment blocked off for 2 dogs... not one.   Our business model requires a prepayment deposit to be make after 2 missed appointments, that will be credited to the following appointment. Two dogs no showing is 2 appointments missed and lost revenue for us. We are not always able to fill those appointments last minute, as was the case. This is only our way of insuring that we will not have an empty slot in the future, not a  harsh personal attack as you infer.\nRegards, Lisa"}, "gmap_id": "0x888922759e8b6b6b:0xb958c1f8ea411005"}

The following week my wife tried multiple times to get I touch with the owner and was unable to get her on the phone or by visiting the salon. We spoke to her sister and left a message, and to no avail have we heard back. The haircut was around 65$ after tax and the matting fee.

The business is located in the downstairs of a building which you access from behind the building. There is no sign indicating this at the front of the building. When I arrived I parked up front and opened the front door to find an abandoned filthy building. I quickly closed the door and ran back to my car. I almost left then, but decided to drive around behind the building. That is when I saw the downstairs door. The upstairs door should be locked with a sign instructing you to go around back. When you get inside everything looks dated, but that's not the problem. I dropped my dog off at 1030. I was told that she would be done around 2 possibly 3 but that I would receive a call 30 minutes before she was ready. I was also told that she would be taken out of the kennel to walk and for a potty break (although there's no grass for this that I saw). At 1:30 I called to check and was told that it would definitely be 3 but that she would call 30 minutes before she was done and she sounded aggravated that I called. At 230 my husband and I decided to leave to pick up some lunch before picking the dog up, and at 309 I still hadn't heard from her. At that point my dog had been there almost 5 hours so I just headed straight there. I got there and she was still working on my dog but only for about 5-10 more minutes after I got there even though I hadn't received a call that she was 30 minutes from being done. Almost as soon as my dog was on the floor she peed which leads me to believe she was never walked or taken out to potty. She was shaved WAY shorter than I asked for her to be. I asked for a simple trim and instead she was shaved with a #5 blade. The lady argued with me and told me that I told her to cut her short, which I did not do. I was also told that it would be 50$ and I was charged 55$. We will not be back here.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532658787294, "text": "Hi Kendra!

Our sign clearly shows the entrance to our business is the bottom level!   Secondly.... we were nice enough to take your Maltese withOUT an appointment and work it in around our other regular customers.  Our regular price for our small dogs is $55.00 and I usually charge a bit more for people without appointments .. so thats what we get for being nice to first time customers! Thirdly.... your dog was the LAST to come in... so it was the LAST to go out. It wouldn't have been fair to the other owners now.... would it?  Lastly... your dog was not in good shape so it had to be taken down short as I explained when you picked her up. Your dog also pee pee'd and poo poo'd in her cage as soon as you  dropped  her off so yes... she was walked thoroughly after that..... and Yes.... we have a very large dog run right next to the shop which you again did not observe... and plenty of grass out back!

It is not uncommon for a dog to get worse during future visits. They did significantly worse when they came to board. When introduced to the group they were snapping and growling at the other dogs. For the safety of your dogs and all of the other dogs we made the decision to remove them from the group.

Apparently they KNEW my dog wasn\u2019t eligible for grooming YESTERDAY but never told me last night when they confirmed his appointment.  When I questioned them on this I was totally blown off and directed to Email the owner with my concerns. Ok, I get it!  I\u2019m 4 days past due on a vaccination.

At least, because I saw that review, I was not so shocked when they brought her out within less than two minutes and said \u201cshe failed.\u201d The test, as the ranch dude explained, involved taking her into a room, on a leash, where there was already a dog; so she did what I could\u2019ve told you she would do\u2014she barked & cried at the dog.  You definitely have to know what you\u2019re doing if you\u2019re going to introduce dogs on a leash. These guys certainly don\u2019t. When I got there, he just called over the loud speaker \u201cBring Jackson [their test dog] into room [blah, blah, blah];\u201d then he took my dog on a leash all the sudden and in approximately two minutes he came back out saying that my dog just \u201csnapped at the other dog the whole time.\u201d\n\nMy dog definitely barks and cries when on a leash when she sees other dogs\u2014she wants to do what\u2019s natural to her (sniff the other dog\u2019s butt and go play). However, she does well, on or off the leash, meeting other dogs if properly introduced.  I\u2019ve boarded my dog before in several places; she\u2019s had dog sitters and even walkers that come to pick her up with other dogs;  I\u2019ve have always been told how sweet she is with other dogs\u2014those other places probably know more about dog behavior than these guys.  I take my dog to different dog parks regularly and I see myself that she does well with other dogs in her own terms or with me guiding her if needed.\n\nI didn\u2019t really care in the end whether they accepted or not.  It\u2019s their loss in the end. They turned away a perfectly sweet dog and loss hundreds of dollars plus future business. I was looking to board for 11 days while I\u2019ll be in Europe and then again later this summer for a shorter trip.  It\u2019s their loss, not mine.

When Jackson attempted to approach she snapped at him. Due to the fact that she was anxious and reacted in an aggressive manner shows that this environment would be too stressful for her.

Sorry she cannot board here, we have lots of big dogs.\" So I said \"let me get this straight, you immediately (in an unfriendly way) take a young dog away from its owner, walk down the hall, open a door where a large Doberman is waiting and because she gets scared you won't take her?\" I also explained that she has boarded plenty of times and does great. I even offered the phone number of the place she boards. The woman says \"Sir, your dog failed the temperament test.\"  All I can say in summary is that NO person or place that knows ANYTHING about dogs would design THAT as it's temperament test.

Everything you have described seems off. The Dog Ranch Resort is a very dog social environment and it is suited for active social dogs. All of our dogs are out in separate groups socializing with one another and they are supervised by our ranch hands. We do not just throw dogs in a dog run or a crate. Our Temperament Test Dog is a Chocolate Lab and not a Doberman. Everyone who meets him sees how calm, easy going, and sweet he is. The way our temperament test works is we want to make sure that your dog is good with a new person, a new dog, in a new place while the parents are away. Since you will be leaving your dog in our care we want to make sure that they are okay without you. What we look for is any signs of aggression, anxiety, and overall temperament of your dog. If they show any signs of aggression then our facility can not accommodate a dog that could be potentially dangerous to the other dogs. If we see a lot of fear and anxiety we always suggest a trial day to allow your dog to get acclimated to our environment. We want to make sure your dog is as comfortable as possible prior to boarding. It is also our policy that a \"Temp Test\" be done at least 2 days prior to boarding in order to allow for a trial day if necessary. Boarding your dog in a new place is very stressful for a lot of dogs so we try to take all of the necessary precautions to make sure that they aren't too overwhelmed. Before jumping in a pool most people test the water, that is the way our temperament test is designed.

I blame myself because I waited until the last minute to make a boarding appointment at my usually facility, which is Golden Animal Hospital in Pike Road(great service and care everytime!). We boarded our 18 month old golden doodle for 10 days. He was supposed to be groomed the last day he was there. We keep his hair long so he was only supposed to be washed and trimmed.\n\nWhen I dropped him off, the receptionist was nice enough but the place smelled very bad. I've used several dog care facilities since we're new to Montgomery and the Bakery was by far the worst in cleanliness.  The dogs and the administration area are all in one. This created a very unorganized check-in since the receptionist was moving, picking up and pushing dogs off the counter the entire check-in. I looked over this because we were literally flying out of town the same day.\n\n10 days later, I called to the Barkery know I was headed to pick my dog up. They told me that they had to cut his hair down low because he had a few matted areas on his legs. I didn't like that but its understandable. I arrive to the counter and the owner hands me a bag of hair to \"prove\" how bad the matts were! They brought my dog out and he was literally shaved down to skin\ud83d\ude25 It was so sad! They didn't even grind or clip his nails. It was clear that they had no clue what they were doing. They couldn't find his collar and leash. They said that I must have taken it with me. I usually take them with me at my normal grooming place but I thought I remembered leaving them. I didn't take the time to debate the point because I was almost numb at the sight of my dog. I just kept telling myself, \"This is your fault for waiting too long to make an appointment and taking him to the ONLY place that had an opening\" Now I know why they had an opening. For the life of me, I can not figure out how people are giving this place good reviews.\n\nWhen I get home and the family and I console each other, lol.....I find my dogs collar and flea collar buried in his door food that I had left with the Barkery. My dog also wouldn't eat for days after we got him back and he was sick for at least a week. He sneezing and vomiting. Btw, he smelled horrible. I was trying to figure out what they used to wash him and if they actually bathed him the day before I picked him up.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever and I would learn to groom my own dog if this was the only place open. On top of all of this, the receptionist and owner never apologized for the haircut. They basically blamed me because I let him get matts.\n\nWorst experience ever!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}

Around 7 I went back to Barkery, and Kimberly and her significant other, Jake arrived( how she had time to go get her boyfriend while she claimed she was looking for my dog, not sure). Kimberly ran inside the building, never spoke, never apologized and sent Jake, who is not an owner of The Barkery,  to \"deal\" with us. Apparently, Kimberly had lied to Jake and told him that she was threatened by myself on the phone and was called a b****h, which was untrue, I was actually quite pleasant all considered. When Kimberly finally came outside, I asked her was she ever threaten or called any obscenity and she said no that never happened. Jake went off to smoke his KOOL cigarette, because the whole reason he came was because of her lie.Why Kimberly would make herself to be the victim when she lost my dog is beyond me. Kimberly yelled us, blamed us,  cursed, and never once apologized. I understand that things happen, but if you're a dog sitter and you lose the dog, you need to take some form of responsibility and at least be sorry and try to help. Instead of being concerned,  Kimberly(owner) and her daughter, and another staff member keep screaming about their \"Livelihood\".  Thankfully, me and my family were able to go out looking at 6:00 am and posting lost posters and found Midnight near Huntingdon College. The staff members saw us looking for our dog, offered no help, and still no apology.  Today is July 9, and The Barkery has never followed up, or showed any concern for their negligence. My dog refuses to leave me or my sisters side since this event, so I'd advise you to find another place to drop off your four legged family member.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}

The Barkery has a very dog friendly natural playful atmosphere where all of the dogs get to be dogs!  They get to play and socialize with one another and get treats and loved on by the staff.  Every dog owner is particular in their own way and that's understanding.  But despite them being our fur children, they are still dogs and want to play with one another and run around.  If you want your dog to have fun and be loved and for you to feel secure knowing that they are safe, then the Barkery is the place to go!!  I'll never go elsewhere.  My dog instantly gets excited the moment we pull up and is eager to run inside.  That lets me know that they too love going there.

I took my furbaby Karmen in on 3/22/17. I wanted her bathed, nails clipped and glands cleaned, and ears cleaned. When I picked her up her head looked wrinkled, not normal.I just thought probably nothing considering she had never been groomed before, BOY WAS I WRONG!!! Whatever it was got worse daily and actually looked different daily! I tried calling the boutique on Mon because I wanted to explain what was going on but they were closed. I had an appointment in Georgia on Tues and I knew by then my dog needed medical attention so on my way home I made her an appointment with Greenbrier Animal Clinic. The vet agreed that it did look like clippers had been used and it also looked like an allergic reaction but couldn't understand why it was just on her head. I asked the vet to call Lylias Poodle Boutique and find out exactly what they did. Our vet said that Dorthy the owner explained their procedure and was very apologetic and told us that she wanted to pay the vet bill, and bathe Karmen in baby shampoo. She also wanted to get a look at what was going on. I told the vet that I really didn't expect her to pay the bill buy the vet said go ahead and let her and let her see what was going on with the dog. The next day my husband and I took our baby into Lylias Poodle Boutique, I thought for sure she would look at the dog but she rudely said I can't give her a bath today!!! I said, I didn't bring het for a bath. I had the invoice in my hand. She said I am not paying the bill and why didn't you call me 1st and I did try Mon but they were closed, to make a long story short, she had zero concern for my dog! She didn't even try to get to a private spot to discuss the situation. She just verbally attacked me and wouldn't let me explain anything! I couldn't get a word in edgewise. She was like I talked to the vet and I said YES I asked her to call you. She got quiet when a customer walked in so I took the opportunity to say, Well alls I know is someone in this place did something to mu dogs head. She then told me that I was rude, I said um I believe you are the rude one!!! She said LEAVE, JUST LEAVE! I then said I used you for over 16yrs, I cannot believe this!!! She said LEAVE!!! I DON'T NEED YOUR BUISNESS!!! I said I will leave and you need not worry I dont need your buisness. The vet treated Karmen for an allergic reaction but she was completely unsure what she was treating. I now believe it may have been blisters from scalding water, I don't think we will ever know exactly what happened. I honest to God cannot believe the way the owner Dorthy treated us. I took my yorkie to her for almost 16 years and recommended this place for years but now I say beware!!!

He was supposed to have been bathed the morning of pick up and was not.  He was panting horribly and obviously in distress because of lack of water.  When we arrived home it was apparent he had not been taken outside as needed.\nHe was frantic to get to his water bowl.\n\nHere is my story.\n\nWe have used Paws to Relax regularly for 7 or more years but never again.  What started as a slow decline about a year ago has now crashed and burned.  Apparently the overseeing authority at Crawford Road Animal Hospital has lost control and/or simply does not care because they have been blatantly ignoring the decline.   I only hope they do not operate their veterinary clinic in the same manner.\nSome sort of change occurred about a year or so ago that resulted in a frustration process of drop off and pick up.  Being solidly satisfied with previous boarding care given to my pets, I overlooked this and dealt with it.  This mutated into being harder and harder to keep up with what time and what days they would and would not be there as hours available became less and days open became a guess.\nThis lack of customer service raised questions as to the care of my pet. He continued to appear happy and well taken care of so I dismissed these thoughts and tried to adapt to their customer service inconsistency.\n\nI arrived to drop Rocky, a Boxer, off Tuesday June 30, 2020 at 11:45.   I had been told there would be someone there until noon and then back at 1.  No one there.   Had to call Crawford Road Animal Hospital to get someone to take Rocky in.  TWICE.\nI expressed concern about care for Rocky since no one was attending the boarding dogs as promised.\nI was assured they were being taken care of so I left him.\nToday, July 3rd was pick up day.   Without ALL of the horribly frustrating details about the unconcerned attitudes ,  I will say it took an hour to simply pick up my pet from a place that is supposed to have an in house person available and to care for the pets left in their charge.  And then his condition was startling.\n\nI had been trying to contact them prior to my arrival.\nCalls continued to go to voicemail with a message that they were closed.\nWhen I arrived it was obvious they were not closed because employee cars were there.\nA technician from the vets office was taking in a pet at paws to relax.  I asked her to bring out Rocky when she came out.  She returns without Rocky and proceeds to walk by me with no acknowledgement.  I had to call to her to get her to stop and she mumbled that someone would bring him out.\nWaiting   Waiting , Waiting....nothing.  Call again.  No answer.\nThen a technician finally came out to get a dog from another car that pulled up for veterinary service.  I asked for someone to come next door to get Rocky.  Was told ok.  Nothing.  Same scenario again 10 minutes later.  And again !   Three people and getting close to an hour and no one answering a phone anywhere or following thru.\nNothing.\nI understand when people are busy but this was different.  It was as if everyone considered it not their job.\nFinally the FOURTH person comes out and proceeds to the Paws to Relax building to get Rocky.   She is very nice and apologizing profusely.\nAn apology can not fix the breakdown of this business.  It is a shame that a business created and tended wonderfully for years is taken over by incompetence and turned in to this debacle.\nThere is nothing that can make leaving my pet unattended and in need of water and exercise ok.\n\nMake your decisions about your pets as you wish but I will never again subject my sweet Rocky to their ignorance and incompetence.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cce4c8f641d05:0xe3b4f48106d5968e"}

He talks down to the owners of the pets so I hate to think what our girl went through when we left thinking she was going to surgery, she was not given anything for pain she didn't have the first stitch in her and he released her with all her wounds open and bleeding, the other vet spent over 3 hours stitching her up and closing wounds, that's how bad she was and he released her like that, and if you still choose to use the vet you should know his anti inflammatory shot he gives combined with the other two he routinely gives causes ulcers in the stomach or shut the kidneys and liver down.

I went there because its convenient to my home, but after several months of using them, its obvious they care more about making money than about your pets health!! I was already displeased about being talked down to when I asked Dr. Leonard about getting my dogs monthly flea/tick and heartworm meds from an online vendor. He told me it would only save me a few dollars, blah blah... but, he seemed to fail to realize that, they are MY dollars!! 4 months later, after paying about $45 a month for her meds through him, I finally decided to place my order through 1800petmeds and pay $60 for a 3 month supply.  Of course, the Rx has to be authorized by your vet, who we just saw less than 2 months ago and had an appointment to see again on the 17th for her final round of puppy shots and to make an appointment for her to be spayed in the coming weeks. After a week has passed, 1800petmeds has faxed them for approval 3x and I have called twice. Finally, they called my husband to say it'll be $18.50 to approve her prescription, and she will need a $25 heartworm test first??? Regardless of the fact that she's been under his regular care since the day I got her at 6 weeks old. I am switching vets. Like, today!!!! I will not be extorted by a cheap, condescending vet who cares more about making a profit off the meds than about the health of my dog. Also, at her last visit, I had her nails trimmed, it was going right along fine when he got to the 8th toenail and all of a sudden she yelped so loud and totally freaked out and he couldn't finish.. but, of course, he didn't cut or hurt her.. she just suddenly got upset.. after calmly letting him cut the first 7 nails!  The ONLY thing I can say positive I can really say about this place is there's a very nice lady that works there on Tuesdays, who seems to care about pet owners and helping them save money while caring for their fur babies.  I used to interact with her alot with my previous pup, who I lost tragically in April, but I haven't seen her much since I got the new one. I'm not sure of her name, but it wasn't the vet, or his wife, who treats my dog like she's just any old anonymous dog... didn't even bother to write her name on the folder containing all the shots, treatment info she sent home, it's just a blank card with no \"pet's name\" written in the blank. Same with appointment cards.. to them, she's just any random dog. Convenience isn't everything! Go elsewhere!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a4a55fcad8c93:0xefd9c5ba96e0a61e"}

This review is completely unfair and not honest. Her dog was seen here four months ago. We don't know why she is suddenly writing a review. First, we don't keep pets here just to make money. We did not charge her $900 for boarding. That's just not true. Hospitalization (boarding) was charged for her pet to stay here for two nights at the cost of $108.22, which included administering the pain medication and antibiotics through the weekend. We stayed late to examine, sedate (to eliviate her dogs pain while she was positioned for radiographs), administered intravenous fluids, splinted her leg, and administer pain and antibiotic medications to her dog through the weekend. All treatments that we provided were completed at her request and signature. The charges weren't any different than would have been charged at any other clinic in Birmingham. This client was not our client and she couldn't get in at any other vet in the area late on a Saturday morning just before we closed at noon.\n\nFinally, we could not discharge her pet because he was completely asleep (sedated). It's something that vets just don't do. Bad things can happen when patients aren't kept quiet and still to rest and stabilize while under anesthesia. Also, the liability of someone driving in a hurry down the highway, slamming on their breaks and causing their dog to fly through the air and breaking it's neck is not a smart thing to allow.\n\nAlso, our honest experience had been that the surgical center doesn't see patients for routine fractures on the weekend. They are kept hospitalized at a general hospital or at the ER until Monday. The emergency hospital that is associated with the surgical center IS open 24/7 for emergencies throughout the weekend. That is probably the information that the client is referring to. This wasn't an emergency as he wasn't in shock and we had stabilized him on intravenous fluids. We literally called down there today and the technician told us that a bill for observation through the weekend for a dog with a simple fracture on intravenous fluids, antibiotics and pain medications at the emergency hospital would literally approach $2000.\n\nSo, we saved this client over $1000, saw her dog when nobody else would, stayed late and provided high quality medicine, and did what was best for her dog.\n\nThis review is not honest or accurate and should be removed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

She told me to come back on a Saturday so I could see the same vet again.  We did just that.  However, this time my dog was examined by Dr. Hankes.  Our appointment was at 10:30am, but we weren't greeted until 10:55.  Dr. Hankes called me instead of coming to speak to me directly (which is fine, it was raining).  He told me that the heartworm medication I was using was ineffective and I needed to do some research on it online.  I've used it for years per a veterinarian in the family's recommendation.  I still can't find poor reviews about the medication online, for the record.  He also said that he preferred to not use 1800PetMeds because it was too much trouble for him to fax in prescriptions.  I asked him to examine my dog for another concerning issue I had, he said he would, but no call from him or response.  A few minutes later, a girl came out with a credit card machine (no invoice) asking me for $70.

We strive to give our clients and their beloved pets the best experience we can offer. Your sweet baby Mercedes came in on 7/14/20 for a spay, which went perfect. Unfortunately the morning after her surgery, we noticed that she was vomiting a little, which we immediately informed you about. When we spoke with you about the vomiting, our associate suggested treatment, which you approved. The relief veterinarian that was on duty thought a fecal exam (stool sample) would help us to be sure that there were no other issues associated with her vomiting, which may have been miscommunicated (we gladly refunded this nominal fee). With this test we did find that Mercedes had hookworms, which can be associated with vomiting in many pets. We informed you of her results and suggested we deworm her. At that time you declined that service. At pick up the receptionist informed you of all charges before finalizing any payment, which at that time you agreed to with no questions asked or problems. When we spoke on 7/16/20, two days after your sweet baby had her surgical procedure to discuss your overall experience, to our surprise you told us that you were unsatisfied with our services. At that time you stated that when you first called for a price quote you were quoted $129 for the spay and were also told that included an IV catheter. This could not have happened as all of our receptionist have been on staff for quite some time and know that these procedures are not included in the surgery fee. I think what happened (because it happens a lot) is that you truly wanted these important protective measures for Mercedes but it all added up to more than you expected it to be with the treatment for the vomiting and nausea. Also, on the sheet that you filled out with the list of recommended pre-surgical procedures such as blood work and IV catheter, the price is clearly stated next to it. Plus there is a box to check yes or no as to whether you wanted the procedure or not right next to the price. Why would we ask you to chose yes or no if it was already included? We refunded you over $107 (which we didn't have to do) as a gesture of good will and you still remained upset and gave us a negative review. Bottom line is that you chose the added procedures which were performed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

BEWARE!!!\n\nSo to start this off please understand, I am not a medical professional, however I professionally remove and rehabilitate wildlife. I am very experienced in just about all wounds, injury's, illnesses, and human harm caused by domestic and non-domestic animals.\n\nI have recently adopted a Dutch Shepherd, my primary vet for all of my inquires is Mercy Hospital(whom in my experience I would trust with my own life!)\n\nMy dog was a rescue, obviously covered in parasites from previous settings.\n\nI explained the situation to the profession under review( my wife made this appointment due to the ease involving COVID-19, as mercy was booked)\n\nKeep in  mind as a wildlife professional, I have already assessed my dogs illness.\n\nThe main reason for a vet was to acquire a  accurate heart worm test.\nWhen handing over my beloved Dutch shepherd I caught myself telling the vets office about her harmless  Sinus Arrhythmia Heart Rhythm(very common in dogs while sleeping)\n\nLonger story shorter, the vet personally talked to me telling me that my dog has a serious heart murmur, and attempted to sway me into the tests to verify. I already knew with no doubt there is not a heart murmur.\n\nThe doctor himself turned into a upselling salesmen attempting to use sympathy to sway me into purchasing tests. I am also a licensed insurance producer for Alabama so I am very aware of salesmen tactics, and I will say he tried. He tried very hard in his sympathetic approach claiming I need to do it now, its very serious.\n\nI then proceeded to my normal vet at Mercy Hospital for a second opinion. My Vet listened to my dogs heart for an extended period, as well as got another in house vet to listen as well as me, we all concluded there is no murmur and the heart is in great condition, afterword's ran tests to conclude.\n\nThis goes to show, don't try to scam people on sympathy, you never know how educated the other party is in your field.\n\nAlso as a consumer warning always be weary of ratings when choosing a service, especially when life is involved, a huge amount of services either pay for reviews, or pay there employees a commission per 5 star review.\n\nI wouldn't use a dishonest practice such as this, but I also can not say my mentioned vet is your best choice, I only speak from personal experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591036913227, "text": "We unequivocally and absolutely DO NOT upsell unneeded diagnostics at this hospital! We offer and provide medically what is appropriate for each pet. We are sorry that Mr. McAllister did not have the experience at our clinic that he wanted. Due to the accusative and completely unfair nature of his review, we must clear up numerus false assertions that he has made. We have reviewed the chart from his dog's visit with the doctors and staff involved. After discussing, all involved remembered clearly the visit. To say that we use sympathy to perform inappropriate diagnostics is completely inaccurate and unfair.\n\nFirst, he requested (just like any other clinic, our receptionists write down EXACTLY on the chart what the client requests for us to do) to have his dog examined because lately she had been mopey. That was his exact words. The primary request was not to have a heartworm test performed. That was a secondary request.\n\nSecondly, his dog had a heart murmur and wasn't feeling well. That is something very different than a sinus arrhythmia which is completely benign. The further cardiac diagnostics that we offered to fully assess the heart condition in a rescue dog was completely indicated (remember this is a rescue in which the medical history is unknown) and was the best medical practice for this dog. Sometimes diagnostics that are performed come back normal and that is great but it doesn't mean that the diagnostics weren't indicated. All vet hospitals offer tests that commonly come back normal.\n\nBoth of our doctors have been out of vet school 24 and 47 years respectively and are very capable of diagnosing heart problems. They do not offer diagnostics that are not indicated but they do offer the best medical diagnostics and treatments for all pets. Do some pet owners decline to have offered diagnostics performed. Yes, every hospital experience this on a daily basis. Do some murmurs come and go? Yes. Did this happen in this case? Maybe.\n\nAlso, why did the other clinic go ahead and do the further diagnostics if it wasn't indicated?? The answer is that they were indicated! Unbelievable! The diagnostics that we offered were indicated.\n\nSo we were presented with a large breed dog that was approximately 5 years old (which makes it middle aged) and had been RESCUED. Dogs that have been rescued commonly have heartworms because they haven't receive proper care which includes heartworm prevention. If it had heartworms they very well could have and commonly can cause a heart murmur.\n\nBottom line: for someone untrained in the veterinary field that rescues and rehabilitates animals to accuse us of using sympathy and scamming people to increase diagnostics is deplorable. The other clinics in the area know we don't do this just as we know they don't practice this way either. This clinic has been here for over 45 years and the current owner has owned it for the past 15 years. We have a great reputation and thousands of happy clients.\n\nThis review is a good example of LIBEL and is illegal. It should be removed!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

BYW, please don't tell Sasha she's a c-a-t.  Sasha was adopted from All Creatures 12 yrs ago as a 6 wk old when Dr. Allen held the reins and my son was a lab tech.\n\nWith the arrival of Dr. Hankes (and my son was gone to college), as you can imagine there were questions about the changes coming.  I have been so very pleased with the continuation of great services and getting to know another vet who is not only a well trained physician but truly loves all the pets that come in and wants the very best for them and their guardians.  The big bonus is that Denise (Sr. Lab Tech), who Sasha usually sees - and Sasha's very shy, has won over my baby and even has her choosing to stay with Ms. Denise instead of me after injections and exams some days.  That says A LOT for the caring ways of the team at All Creatures and who they are as crew members/care givers not just employees..\n\nRecently, Sasha had a period of rapid weight loss after getting a kidney issue under control and Dr. Hankes found that she had a growth on her thyroid as well as fluid around her heart causing breathing issues.  She was a very sick little girl.  Dr. Hankes treated her heart and brought it under control and within a period of weeks.  Dr. Hankes, teamed with Dr. Hall, was then able to remove the problematic portion of the thyroid and the growth.  Now 4 wks after surgery, her heart is doing well - she's gaining weight and running round the house like a wild 4 yr old instead of a 12 yr old.  Dr. Hankes and Dr. Hall did a great job with the surgery, the staff let Sasha recouperate in her basket with a blanket from home and are now keeping a tabs on her for a while to make sure her remaining thyroid is functioning properly.  Thanks to their great care, we're looking forward to many more years together.\n\nI have recommended All Creatures to my family, friends and new neighbors who are in need of a vet and have for years and hope you'll see them, too.  I don't know of any Pet Hospital around where you can get the top quality care PLUS the Super Care Givers that are on the team with Dr. Hankes at All Creatures Pet Hospital.

I know that you mentioned Lunita sees lots of people all the time, but a daycare situation can be a very different environment for a dog. She was clearly overwhelmed and nervous from the beginning and even with more time to adjust it was clear that she would not thrive in a group play environment. Our temperament test is designed to not only ensure that a dog does not pose a risk to the rest of the pack but it also helps us determine if this type of daycare/boarding is the best environment for your pup. Just like people, some dogs find different situations more stressful or enjoyable than others.\n\nWhen we determine that a pup might not be a good fit, we generally have a manager call to provide a thorough explanation and offer recommendations. With the additional protocols currently in place to protect our clients and staff, it sometimes it gets a little more hectic and we apologize that you did not feel assured in our assessment.\n\nI am so glad that you found a place to board Lunita! We wish you and your pack the best, and please let us know if you would be interested in continuing this conversation."}, "gmap_id": "0x88893d529c0176db:0x3436b80342c70748"}

Even though there are five vets that offer boarding within 5 miles of my house, his facility is the only one I trust.\n\nThe thing I love most about WTD, is the fact that he has someone on site 24/7.  Your dog will never be left unattended or just \u201clocked up\u201d in kennel all day.  They are always playing and socializing with a great amount of supervision during the day, and at night, they have spacious kennels and someone is always staying with them.\n\nAs far as training goes, Adam helped us tremendously.  We have a German Shepherd that was starting to become fear aggressive until Adam worked with her.  He spent hours walking us through the steps to get her back on track and left us with a plan.  It was hard work, but we did everything he said.  Now, three years later, we have the most amazing dog we could have ever hoped for.  Adam is still one of our dog's favorite people in the world, and she gets so excited every time we pull in his parking lot she can barely stand it!\n\nOverall, We Talk Dog is an amazing, clean, organized and well looked after facility, and the training is outstanding.  I think some people want a trainer to come out and \"fix\" their dog for them, but that can't be done.

We called about enrolling our rescue dog in daycare and getting some training to help integrate her into the world. Our message was taken and they never called back. so I figured I would just take her down there and have a talk with these folks. I grabbed her vet papers. I had the day off so I threw on my t-shirt and flip flops since it was a hot summer day and upon arrival we were greeted by poo on the floor of the foyer and were looked up and down by the woman standing there who promptly frowned. She talked with the peson in front of me for a bit longer while studying us with that same frown on her face and after they finished their conversation asked \"May I help you?\". So a little back story on this dog. She is a boston terrier who we are fostering for a local rescue. She came from a puppy mill situation and she has a scar on one eye and at the point of writing this is still pretty malnourished. She is not the prettiest dog in the world but she is sweet and everyone who knows her loves her, Except this person apparently. SO, I told her what we were interested in and the best she would offer up was a piece of paper to sign up that she never actually gave me. She then launched into the fact that we would have to schedule a temperament assessment and that the next available appointment was several weeks out. I told her we had called several weeks ago and no-one called us back. She said that she had seen my message and that their trainers were \"Very busy\" and that they simply could not afford the time to contact me. I explained to her the situation with this dog being a rescue and that being a foster home we were not likely to have her too very long to which she simply stuff the paper back in the manilla envelope from which it came and gave me that tilted head, high pitched, insincere, \"Sorry\". So we left. Precious, our rescue dog, seemed to be a little down about it so I went by our local bagel shop who makes dog treats and picked us both up a little something for the rejection. All in all though, after thinking about it, I would not take any of my dogs to this place. Between the poo on the floor, the bad attitude, and the inability to return a phone call I don't know that I would trust these folks with my family. We had hoped to get this poor little dog some extra socialization and training to help her get along with her permanent home. I guess the search continues.

We have never had any problems up to this point and all groomings have been on point. I knew when we walked in and saw that our normal groomer, Jonathan, was not in that it might be a tad different groom but I did not expect what we got. We asked for our doodle to be cut to about 1/2 inch without sacrificing his curls. Everytime Johnathon would cut him he would always take time to walk him back gently and today our doodle was roughly pulled to the back, and when we picked him up he was shaved down with no curls in sight. I called to express my frustration and try to process a remedy to the problem and the receptionist was extremely defensive, condenscing, and rude. As if we were the problem. Just FYI, Johnathon has moved to start his own pet salon in ATL so they will not be providing the same services if you have been a previous customer. We will no longer be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d529c0176db:0x3436b80342c70748"}

Came home exhausted each time as if he had a blast. As far as the friendliness of the staff, that was a hit or miss, honestly. I only interacted with one lady who I think may have been the owner that was really really sweet. Anyone else would come get my puppy from the car in the mornings, not say good morning or anything, just grab him and walk inside. I don\u2019t know a single staff member\u2019s name because no one ever introduced themselves to me. His very first day at daycare, he came home with scratches on his face from where he\u2019d gotten into a fight with another dog. His second time at daycare, I got a call from one of the staff members there letting me know that he\u2019d got bitten in the head by another dog & was asked if I wanted to come pick him up. I debated on not going back after that but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. A few weeks later, my puppy contracts Kennel Cough from there which ultimately developed into pneumonia. As any other pet parent, I was angry because every dog is supposed to be fully vaccinated in order to attend there. $250 later, thankfully, he made a full recovery. I didn\u2019t take him back for weeks because I was paranoid. However, I moved closer to the area and decided to give it another shot. Took him back on a Friday. A few days later, I notice he isn\u2019t feeling well & end up having to take him to the emergency vet at 2:30 am. What have you know, Kennel Cough AGAIN. He\u2019s been sick now for almost two weeks. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this facility.

Our COVID Care protocols have definitely made it much more difficult for our staff to interact with our clients with conversations.  We have really missed these interactions too!  We do feel strongly that our curbside dropoff/pickup services as well as our staff wearing full PPE is in the best interest of our community, our clients, and our staff - but it has definitely left us missing those close interactions and relationship building with our clients.  I'm sorry you missed that too.  We are definitely learning how to best create relationships with our clients in the climate of COVID safety.  Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to grow and change with these new and ever changing restrictions.\n\nI'm also sorry to hear your pup got cough while he was participating in our services.  This particular strain of cough this year has actually made several national news stories as it has shown up all over the country.  It's been a nasty strain.  We worked very closely with our veterinary advisory team to be sure we were utilizing the absolute best practices in cleanliness and disinfectant protocols throughout our facility.  We also did our best to inform all clients honestly and openly about the outbreak.  We feel very fortunate that we were able to get it under control so quickly because of our amazing veterinary advisory team.  Just like childcare, dog daycare does pose a slightly higher risk of dogs getting upper respiratory infections and sometimes GI upset in group play.  We do our very best to inform our clients of this by having it clearly stated in several places on our General Client Agreement all clients receive and sign before their first day of daycare with us.  While we sincerely wish the bordatella vaccine required by our facility was able to protect against all cough, just like the human flu vaccine, it does not.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your feedback and wish you and your dog well and that you are able to find another facility that suits your needs.  Please let us know if we can help you with any pet care needs in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923bd8bf81a99:0xf88dcba01a8213d"}

So they took our name and number for the owner to call us and get us a refund. The owner did end up calling a week later from an unknown number and left a voicemail.

On one occasion I spoke to the manager and he was going to call me back. Never called me back. At this point I guess I\u2019m using this as a $50 life lesson to never pay ahead of time (despite their policy that the price goes up if you pay there).

However, I found the classes to be ridiculously unprofessional. They charge the going rate, $20 per 1 hour class session for 4 sessions. However, the classes never start on time, the instructor is rarely prepared with her materials, generally she is looking at her phone several times per lesson and disappearing into another room, and 2 of 4 classes ended early. The instructor clearly knows how to train a dog, however this place has a business model based on you dropping your dog off for several weeks and a thousand or more dollars later they train the dog for you. I have no doubt she is exceptionally effective in that environment, but these classes where you learn to train your dog yourself are over complicated, incoherent, and lack any kind of structure. I feel like mostly they are used to get you to admit you need to drop your dog off with them, because that is the only way the dog will get trained. I've had better experiences with a big box store training, and that isn't saying much. There are significantly better training places for the same money with a whole lot less agenda. Hint: look for a non-profit dog obedience and training club.<P>\n\nResponse to the owner:\nFirst off, it's labelled a rolling class. You don't need to offer \"a missed class at no extra charge\", that's part of it being rolling. You show up for 4 classes, whether they are consecutive or not, and I checked ahead of time to make sure that was the case. Second, in 3 of the 4 classes there was no socialization time unless you count the period of time we all waited in the office while the instructor was running late. Ending the class early twice ensured no socialization time. You offer 14 days of board and train for $1100 and 28 days for $2100. Both of those cost more than the thousand dollars I put in my review. So yes, you offer both cheaper and more expensive options, personally I think I hit the middle pretty well with my review. I put in my review you charge the going rate. I don't dispute that. I also said the trainer knows how to train dogs, the trainer simply didn't do much to help people learn to train their own dogs in this one class. Finally, the Birmingham Obedience and Training club is a non-profit club, they just aren't a charity.

I am the owner of Roverchase and you have not contacted us in your 4 week training so, until this review, I was unaware of your unhappiness.  I have called the other puppies in your class period and they have all been exceptionally pleased and have all signed up for additional group classes for continuing education, so I am a bit confused.  I would be more than happy to talk with you about your experience.  I do know that your dog missed a week of Puppy Kindergarten and we were very happy to accommodate your schedule and allow you to makeup your missed class at no additional charge.     Puppy Kindergarten is a socialization and basic manners class and not a true \"training skills\" course.  This is very clear in the description of our class on our website as well as the materials given in each class period.  As mentioned previously, I would be more than happy to speak with you about your experience, please feel free to call the front office at 205-332-0203 and ask for Abigail.  Also, as a note, our day-training program is our most popular program but it is hardly \"thousands of dollars.\"  Most of our clients spend between $250-450 for four weeks of all day training where they drop their dog of several times a week each week.  This is hardly \"thousands of dollars\" and is, in fact, some of the best prices is town.  Our Puppy Kindergarten class is also priced competitively with \"the big box store\" but you are taking this class from one of the most highly experienced and certified canine behavioral consultants in the city.  As an additional note, our prices are less expensive then the Obedience Club in our town, which is not non-profit.  Birmingham does not have a non-profit training club."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923bd8bf81a99:0xf88dcba01a8213d"}

Aidan did a great job and took time to work on things that I specifically was having trouble with when there was not a big class. I took my dog to daycare and the owner, Abigail, stated that he was having trouble and recommended a behaviorist that comes to Roverchase every Thursday and Saturday. The price was $400 dollars which I was happy to pay because I really wanted the best for Blue (my dog). We talked with the behaviorist for about an hour and that was the end of the session. The behaviorist did not really teach or show me anything that I did not already know. The behaviorist did not even see the behavior that I was having trouble with but yet she was quick to write out a treatment plan. The behaviorist did say that I would need to do private lessons with Abigail which is not included in the cost. So for $400 dollars I talked to a lady for an hour. This is a big scam and I am really troubled that Roverchase would be a part of it.\n\nMy appointment lasted 1 hour. We left right after 5 and the appointment started at 4. So go back and check your cameras again. Yes, I was happy to pay the $400 dollars which I stated previously. But I was under the impression that I would get useful information and more than just talking to a \"Behaviorist\" for an hour. Again, how can she, the behaviorist, tell me what is the cause and real problem without even seeing the behavior. I even emailed the behaviorist trying to get a refund because that was not what I was expecting. Not even wanting a full refund because I understand that she did take time out of her day to meet with me. But I think she can keep the $80 dollars deposit and refund the $320 since I do not need her \"expertise\" any longer. But she has not responded to my email which she specifically stated was the best/fastest way to communicate with her. And as far as reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith...I did that. You decided to lie on your response by saying that you checked the cameras and that I was there for a little under 2 hours. Your cameras times are off or you lied. I told you that I actually loved Roverchase. I even recommended people go to y'all which only one of them did but one is better than none. But I do still think that I was scammed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1525838804535, "text": "Dear Mr. Auer,\nI\u2019m so surprised to read your review regarding your experience with Blue and Dr. Beihunko, Roverchase, and the chain of events you described.  I appreciate you giving me the opportunity on this public platform to respond.\nFirstly, I\u2019m so glad you were pleased with your group classes at Roverchase with our trainer Aidan.  He\u2019s so talented and our clients just adore him.  I\u2019ll be sure to pass on your praise.  Thank you.\nTo address your concerns regarding your experience with Dr. Biehunko, I will do my best to address them in an organized fashion.\n-  I recommended Blue see Dr. Biehunko when Blue presented to daycare last week after a 5 month absence from Roverchase.  Prior to Blue\u2019s absence, we had discussed at length Blue\u2019s increase reactivity and dog related aggression and you indicated you did not want to address it with us at that time but wanted to work with it on your own.  We advised against it.  When you presented last week, Blue came for a day of daycare and was significantly worse in all behaviors.  I recommended a consultation with Alabama\u2019s only Veterinary Behaviorist, Dr. Biehunko.  I thoroughly explained how Dr. Beihunko\u2019s consultations worked, that they were $400 and for that price you received a 1.5-2hr consultation with her expertise and she would make a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and then have 6 months of medical management and follow up.  I was very clear with you that there was no doubt that Blue would need additional lessons with me and that it would be at additional cost.  You remarked that you felt this price was fair for her experience and expertise and made your appointment for later in the week\n- I do rounds with Dr. Biehunko each day for our shared clients.  She had already been thoroughly briefed on Blue\u2019s behavior at Roverchase the day he returned as well as my notes from his behavior in December when we last saw him.\n- Your consultation with Dr. Biehunko was just barely under 2hrs.  I checked the time stamp on our cameras\n- In your consultation with Dr. Biehunko we were all very surprised to hear that you insisted that Blue has received no training outside of his training at Roverchase.  In fact, you insisted this was true even when specifically questioned about this by Dr. Biehunko and the Roverchase trainers who sat in on the session with you.  As I\u2019m sure you know, it\u2019s extremely difficult for any doctor to communicate effectively and efficiently with a client when that client willfully withholds pertinent information from that doctor that impedes the treatment plan.  As you can see from the attached screen shots, not only has Blue been in training with another trainer, but it was for the very issue he was presenting for.\n- Finally, since your consultation was just over 72 hours ago, and we are very clear that treatment plans can take 2-4 weeks to become effective, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can already be so unhappy with your results.\nI certainly believe that pet owners are allowed to train and handle their pets as they see fit and that there are many fits available for many different preferences.  However, I hope we can both agree that reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith and this one has some glaring issues.  I hope, in light of this, and in light of you many months of happiness with Roverchase, you will consider removing it.  We certainly wish you and Blue only the very best and much success in all of your endeavors.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAbigail Witthauer\nRoverchase\n\nEDIT::  attachment will not post.\nDescription of photo attachment:  Blue the dog on a trainers business page looking at the screen wl a clearly visible electronic training collar, caption from the trainer, \u201cBlue the Australian Cattle Dog rocked his first lesson.

Yesterday, her amniotic fluid broke at about 1:35 pm. We called you around 5:30 pm to find out if her condition is normal. Your doctor is very sure to tell us not to worry. It will be around 1:30 in the evening. It \u2019s been 12 hours. When I called your doctor again and left a phone number for us, we called for a long time before contacting your doctor, but he still said everything was normal. He only helped to find the contact method of the pet emergency room, but during the two prenatal inspections of iris before, we twice asked you to help us find a contact method for the emergency room. You said that even if there is a problem, you can do it at night Calling you, you also have an emergency room at night, saying that she will have no problems with the second production. Even if there is a problem, you can help me at night. I believe you, because Iris has been here to check with you . But last night when we needed you most, I took a long time to contact you. I also thank you for helping me find the emergency room contact method at the end, but just when we were going to see the emergency department When Iris left us, I always wondered why during the two prenatal check-ups, we asked for an emergency room contact method. You only gave me your outpatient phone number, and I remember I told you that It \u2019s just that Iris can contact the doctor who can help her when the 1% you said needs the doctor \u2019s help. You said you can help her even at night, but when Iris needs the doctor \u2019s help most, where are you , Did you know that because we spent the time to rescue her in the most urgent time, if you can help me find the emergency room contact method, at least Iris still has the hope of survival, and May continue to be with us. Do you know that iris is like our daughter in our hearts? Do you know how helpless we are when we watch iris walk away in front of us? I want to ask you Where is the night emergency? I want to ask if your commitment is really so worth mentioning? Iris just had her two-year-old birthday last month. She is still so young, and the baby in her stomach has a total of 9 lives.

The office manager helped me with getting out 3 dogs records from our previous vet and arranged our pets visits. During the vet visit the Doctor was on the phone with me the entire time (during COVID) - explained everything including the cost for each test and medication. She answered all of my questions honestly and was great to explain everything. My dog suffers from allergies and previously we were not taken very seriously and told to give large doses of Benadryl even though I explained that does not work for her anymore- it never really did. The most vital part was that she helped me with a treatment plan for my dog. At the end of the visit #1 I was not surprised by the bill- she discussed all that with me as we spoke and #2 I knew the all of the next steps. That was a big deal because where we were before I never had a treatment plan and basically we started over every time we came in. The next day Lucy\u2019s skin was not red, hot, and irritated, she wasn\u2019t chewing on her paws and shaking her head, she wasn\u2019t panting and stressing her and everyone around her out. she was relaxed and calm, and sleeping so peacefully- that hasn\u2019t happened in 8 years for her. The doctor even called me back to go over all of her blood work results. I have never been more impressed with a veterinarian clinic. I am actually a little embarrassed that I continued taking my dogs to the previous vet all these years- had I known the level of service that we were missing and the expertise these doctors offer in comparison to what we had grown accustomed to, I would have moved them many years ago.

We passed on this at the moment to discuss the $150 fee they were asking.\n\nThey did let me know they were able to get his back paws trimmed. Upon returning home, we found that they completely broke one of our dog's back nails. Not just broke, but practically tore it out of the nail bed. It's sitting 90 degrees from where it's supposed to be.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to think this through...if this was the first nail they tried to cut...then of course he acted out the rest of the time. He was hurt!\n\nIf it was the last nail they tried to cut and he had been acting so bad to begin with, why didn't they stop?\n\nAnd...you're telling me you didn't know you hurt him that badly??? How can this happen and you not see it?\n\nToday, he is at another vet who was able to examine him without any sort of sedation. The nail that was injured by Helena Veterinary Clinic will now cost me $200 to fix.\n\nHelena Veterinary Clinic's response to this...it's my fault.

I don't expect anyone to stop everything when something happens to one of my animals but when an animal is very old and becomes short of breath and semi responsive, you'd at least think the vet office that you call would at least sound like they care even if they don't. In a brief phone call, it was obvious that the person who answered was not concerned, sympathetic, or compassionate. Luckily, there is another office that we were able to contact, be seen, and send our sweet angel to Heaven within an hour. She was almost gone when we called your office and were told you could see us in about 2 hours like it was just some routine vet visit.

When I came to pick her up, she was overjoyed to see me, which is normal, so I paid and left. After getting my dog in the car, she was acting so weird and pitiful. I went back to ask if they had any issues with her and they assured me that she was one of the most behaved doodles they\u2019ve worked with. Sadly, my dog has been acting weird for over a week and I just discovered that the groomer completely butchered her paws. The nails are cut WAY too short (into her flesh) and she has severe razor burn in between the pads of her paws, which she licks at constantly. After reading the reviews, I completely believe that my poor dog was mistreated and I will never bring her near that place again.

He was seen by Dr. Goodwin. I was told he was blocked and had to have a surgery that would basically open up his urethra. So he had the surgery and he came home. He wasn\u2019t getting better. Still in complete pain, losing weight, and straining horribly to use the bathroom. Not only that but he now has a gaping hole in his rear that is exposed to outside air and bacteria and causing infection. We went back to Goodwin in December for them to redo the surgery. Still not successful. At this point he\u2019s being boarded at the Chantilly facility for constant observation. Looking back I\u2019m assuming because they knew they had messed my baby up. So January rolls around and he\u2019s not better. Weight loss, no appetite, and clearly in pain constantly. Dr. Sermon(?) decided to take over and redid the surgery AGAIN.  At this point my cat has been boarded there for over a month and has had THREE SURGERIES. Now I have a cat with constant issues at this point. They said the surgery was effective. WRONG IT WAS NOT. I\u2019ll put a pic in the comments of his rear on the regular due to this complication. He couldn\u2019t even sit down comfortably. He couldn\u2019t walk like a normal cat. And he was constantly crying out in pain and straining. I switched vets at the point and had to spend the next three years of his life at routine visits every 2-3 months to have him sedated and antibiotics and his rear cleaned up. This constant pain eventually took a toll on him. I paid hundreds for prescription food and frequent vet visits and all Goodwin did for me was take a couple grand off my bill and left me with still around a $2k bill for them ruining my cats life. He recently died at only 6 years of age due to his poor quality of life and constant pain and infection caused by this surgery. I\u2019ve investigated this with an attorney and I\u2019m regretful I waited this long as it is outside of the statute of limitations for malpractice or Goodwin would have a lawsuit on their hands. I truly believe they single-handedly ruined my cats life and caused him to be taken from me way too soon.

I brought my puppy in for a haircut to help me manage my allergies and they nicked him badly and did not tell me. My dog is a docile 7 pound yorkie-poodle that vets and groomers describe as manageable and sweet. Later, they admitted they \"forgot\" to mention the cut. My dog needed surgery and stitches, which resulted in a $330 vet fee that the groomers did not cover, despite assuring me they would do so ahead of the surgery. I was told  by the owner, Ken Beasely, that he \"needed two weeks to come up with that kind of money\" then that he would not cover the bill (which indicated they do not have business/accident insurance). Although I communicated with him calmly, presented receipts he requested and the vet's number, he was belligerent and admitted to several other counts of animal negligence (cutting another dog on the neck that bled so profusely they had to stitch him immediately) in efforts to explain that my animal's wound was not a big deal. He seemed to be on drugs and asked why I was worried about my little puppy when he didn't have personal insurance. He also seemed angry at the dogs he groomed, stating  \"they all bite him every day.\" This is a very dangerous attitude for someone who works closely with animals.  While the business seems clean and respectable from the outside and is located in a nice area, and while the man who admitted my dog seemed kind and assured me they would take good care of him, the grooming room I caught a glimpse of when picking up my dog was filthy and unsanitary. Additionally, when I went to the pet store for bandages, a woman I spoke to working there shared that she had mistakenly taking her dog to Jonathan's Grooming Studio for a simple nail trim. She shared that all of his nails were bleeding when she picked him up and she had to carry him up and down stairs in her home for a month. This business needs to be shut down. Not only are they negligent, but they expressed no remorse for hurting animals.

Dr. Farmer is a wonderful vet and I have used him for years. However recently we saw Dr. Bearden. I cannot recommend her under any circumstances. My dog had an obvious deformation in her leg after an accident. Dr. Bearden put her in a splint, took X-rays and told us she would send them to a surgeon. Each week we went back and the treatment plan/diagnosis/story changed. The staff would tell me something different than she did each time. She never sent the X-rays to a surgeon. 6 weeks this went on. (Shame on me for letting it go on so long) On the last visit the dog was dropped off 7am, at her request, for observation without the splint. She didn\u2019t look at the dog or remove the splint until I called at 1:30 for an update. At 3:30 she claimed the dog only had \u201cliganitis\u201d but was still not putting weight on the leg. When I asked about the \u201cdent\u201d she claimed I had never told her about it. Not true, and it was easy to see on the dog\u2019s leg. She wanted to give the dog back without a splint. I had the staff splint the leg and took the dog to another vet. She had to have a metal plate surgically implanted to fix the damage.

They still charged us for the day they were closed, but refused to let us pick them up. First red flag. When I picked them up Tuesday I noticed they had a green/yellow discharge coming from their eyes. I took them back to Madison Animal Care Hospital to get them looked at. Turns out they both had eye infections. Best part is they charged me full price for the examinations, tests, and medicine. No discount at all even though the most likely cause was from something they got into while being boarded by the same facility.

I've never had an issue with them, yet I don't know if the owners change or if it's just the staff.\n\nI took my dog in to get an annual procedure. With the Covid19, everything is curbside now. The person came to the door and asked is this all we're doing or did I want to do blood work as well. I asked how much the blood work was and how much the full total was going to be. She estimated around $250. So I signed off and all was good. I had the vet come out and talk to me about my dogs health and it was all good. She told me someone would call me shortly so I could pay the bill over the phone. When they called, they said I owned $480.80. I asked her what happened to the $250 I was quoted? I completely understand an estimate is just that, an estimate. Yet when you're jumping over 100% over it's ridiculous. She told me someone would call me the next day to discuss.\n\nI get a call from Christy who then tries to inform me that I was quoted $250 for the blood work only. She was very condescending and tried to pin this on me. Lucky for me, I keep a dash cam for insurance reasons and was able to send her the video of the whole conversation.\n\nAfter they reviewed she calls me back and the first thing she says is \"You win, we lose. $250 is the total.\" She proceeded to speak in a very condescending manner to me. This wasn't about winning or losing. She then tried to tell me that me recording on public property was illegal with a bit more rude attitude. I wonder how'd she feel to know I also record all my phone calls as well.\n\nI say all this to state that I wouldn't go back her.
