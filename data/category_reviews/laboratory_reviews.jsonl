Today I went to Summit Express Care to have a physical done for a form I needed to fill out. There was a question about the way they bill--I asked them to try to bill through my insurance, and they refused. I decided to go ahead with the process anyway. I was called up and told that because of a previous experience I had, they refused to see me. I was shocked, because while I do remember the receptionist being rude in the past, I did not remember any major altercation. Not to mention, even if I had ever gotten frustrated, I would never have been mean or threatening in any way. I said it was shocking that they would refuse care. based on some past frustration. She said it's a private physician-owned clinic and they can see whomever they want. I asked to speak to the person making the decision and was told it was the physician who owns the clinic. Understand, I have also had good experiences there, so I'm not sure why I didn't get credit for those. Anyway, I was told she refused to see me and was told I could leave my contact information, but with no assurance that I would actually be called. The receptionist told me that it was based on a review I had written before. I cannot find any reviews I have ever written. My husband wrote one based on the same kind of deal with the refusal to even try to work with our insurance process because they think they know what will be covered, 19 months ago. I said, \"I'm sorry, but since I can't even remember what the details are that would prompt me to write a bad review, that happened at least 19 months ago, it would seem that you could let by-gones be by-gones.\" I was told once again they could see whomever they wanted. I was not told what I had written, what the issues were, nor where I had written a negative review.  As I left, I did tell the receptionist that since I was not being given the courtesy of an explanation, that I was left with no choice but to leave a bad review, and she agreed that that would be fine. I would much rather have had a conversation.  As a health care professional myself, I cannot imagine not seeing someone just because they got frustrated one time in the past.

So i asked the receptionist then Doctor Miller to have it sent too Wal mart, i go all the way into Wal mart for my meds that was much needed and it was NEVER called in and when i called it was the answering service. They closed at 5 i was at Wal mart at 5:24. Soo now i have to go all weekend without. Thanks.. when i left Capstone the gate was down at the pharmacy but they were still there. I guess some get treated differently there than other's", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1628536917120, "text": "Thank you for your review and rating.

I had a horrible cough during that and developed a hard pressure in the upper center part of my stomach which is pushing on my ribs and heart (possibly vagus nerve) I explained all of this to the doctor that I seen and told him I was having problems breathing since it started, much worse when I sat down. I also explained to this doctor that I had been taking meds for migraines but had ran out and needed a refill. Once this doctor found out I was a smoker, he seemed to not even care at all. He blamed everything on smoking. I had my 12 year old son in the room at the time and this doctor literally drew a graph of how long I was going to live on the bed paper. He terrified my son!!! I knew then I'd never see that man again! Instead of checking to see what the pressure was and instead of refilling a med I had been taking for 12 years he put me on Buspar. The first night I took that Buspar the pressure increased so bad I could hardly move! I'm also now having to take bp meds since all of this. I'm 34 years old, I should not have all of this going on and for it to hit like it did all at once. And instead of this doctor trying to help me he terrified my son! He also prescribed me Naproxen which luckily I didn't take because I went to St. Vincent where they done at egd and found I have chronic gastritis as well as reflux esophagitis so the Naproxen could have caused a stomach bleed... I've seen another doctor here who is better than the first but I am still having the same issues. I'm honestly believing a stuck hiatal hernia or something else has been missed. The new doc put me on zantac which didn't help either. I feel no better, in fact I feel worse than when I did when I went to try and get help here about 5 months ago.

All of a sudden the receptionist, patients and staff are running screaming at me to run down the hall. They scream over the intercom code silver. I get up and start going down the hall. The first waiting room I came to was x-ray. The staff inside locks the door and I\u2019m tapping on the window to find out what\u2019s going on. Just so happens I know one of the woman working there. A gentleman asks her if she knows me and she replies yes. They slip me a note through the door telling me to call them in 15 minutes. I hear a woman inside say get forceful and tell him to leave. I turn to look down the hall and every soul is gone except for me and the man who stole a gun out of a car in the parking lot. I had no idea where he was. No one would help me or tell me what was going on. I was locked out in the hallway that is at least 80 yards long by myself with no means to defend myself. The man was obviously sick and out of his mind. I saw him when I pulled up and he gave me an uneasy feeling. I was not scared for me but thought to myself what if an elderly/young woman or a child walked in the door behind him what would they do. The only thing I could think to use to defend my self was a chair that was sitting in the radiology waiting area. I said to myself he will probably shoot me but hopefully I can beat him enough with the chair that he couldn\u2019t hurt anyone else. I was starring down the hall waiting for him to walk/run towards me and I was going to do my best to stop him with a chair. Another thought I had was if I had my gun on me I would at least be in a better position to defend myself. Luckily the police got there and disarmed the man. I was so mad at the hospital staff for telling me to run down the hall and then locking me out of EVERYTHING. I was nothing more than a target at that point. I could understand their policy a little better if I hadn\u2019t been waiting for 45 minutes in the same chair they ask me to flee from while rushing other patients into offices to protect them from a possibility bad outcome. I asked the Administrator what was the big plan for me. Wait till he shoots me then scurry on over to the E.R. All he said was this is not supposed to happen here.

Worse 'patient/dr. manners I have encountered' I have been having excruciating pain in left knee, sleepless nights and misery for about 3 weeks.

I am a very healthy 84 yr old, just had raving reports from primary Dr. this week on my lab work, agility and very active lifestyle. Dr. Kissels words to me were that's an old 80 year old knee, some arthritis. Take tylenol and get an otc cream. I asked if it could be a torn miniscus he said probably but that knee is old with a lot of miles. No mention of mri or further ckg into it. I could walk 2-5 miles with no limp before this onset, don't take pain pills, have not been admitted to any hospital since 1976 ,clean my own gutters, horseback ride etc. He repeatedly referred to my old knee. Well I plan to use these 'old knees' for several more years to play t ball and dollhouse in the floor with my great grands. Needless to say I cancelled my appt. to go back in two weeks, I heard him loud and clear about my old knees.

I feel very safe in his office. Dr. Worthen is part of the St. Vincent\u2019s Orthopedic group at St. Vincent\u2019s. Everyone in the office was wearing a face mask. There is plenty of sitting space in the waiting room so everyone can easily be safety distanced. Checkin was quick and efficient. I met with the doctor at my appointment time without having to wait. The practice has its own X-ray so I was quickly  x-rayed & Dr. Worthen was able to review it while I was there for my appointment. Dr. Worthen is a excellent orthopedic surgeon. He evaluated my knee and we discussed my physical theraphy schedule. He will have me come back in a month to check my progress.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611247589513, "text": "Thanks for the great feedback! We will be sure to pass it along to our team!

She called me at 11:30pm to say she felt lightheaded, a little dizzy, and had what felt like a slight pressure in her chest. She called the ambulance and the EMT's took her to St. Vincent's to be checked out.\n\nI had left Montgomery immediately after receiving the call and arrived at the hospital minutes after her ambulance had arrived (the EMT's were just bringing out the gurney to their rig when I got there) I went into the Emergency Room, told them why I was there and gave them info on my mom (name, date of birth, address, phone, and reason for admittance). The woman told me they were going to get her in a room and then ask when I could come back. I was the ONLY person in the waiting room. About 20 minutes later she said again that they had her in a room and would see when I could go back. Fifteen minutes after that she said a woman had just gone back to see if I could go back. Needless to say it was over an hour before they let me go back. The worst part is that I had assumed they would at least let my mom know I was there. Even though she had been asking them and voicing concerns about how I had not yet arrived no one from the waiting room told her I was there and none of the nurses back with my mom bothered to check if I had arrived. This was not a far walk either, considering my mom was approx. 30 ft inside the doors from the waiting room I was in.\n\nWhen I finally did get back to see her she was hooked up to a heart and pulse/ox monitor and they had a fluid IV in. They took her out to get chest X-rays and a CT scan minutes after I got back there. When she returned to the room about 15 minutes later, the nurse that brought her back first said she didn't know how to hook my mom back up to the machine and the IV...then was going to try...then decided no, she would have someone come in and do it. A half hour went by and no one came in to hook her back up. I stepped outside the door and explained that she had not been hooked back up and the nurse at the station said thanks, and they would come in and do it...which they never did. The original doctor she saw was also standing there when I told the nurse and did nothing. You would think if you were monitoring someone who you think may have had a heart attack you would want them hooked up to a monitor.\n\nFinally, the doctor came in a little before 4am and said that the X-rays, and CT scan were just fine, but there were concerns with her blood work (PS no one had ever come in to hook my mom back up to the monitors). The doctor explained there are three types of cardiac enzymes. One that tells if there is actual muscle damage and that they use to determine if you've had a heart attack (which was normal and my mom did not), and two others. One of the extra two was normal and then the doctor said that the third was \"significantly higher.\" She said that could indicate that although she may not have had a heart attack that enzyme could mean there could be something brewing or big That could happen on the horizon. She wanted to admit my mom so she could see the cardiologist in the morning...which we did. Kicker is when the cardiologist came in and looked at the tests he said it was slightly elevated, but nothing that he found alarming.\n\nAll in all I just felt like even though the ER was extremely slow, and at times there were 4 or more staff members sitting at the desk area within the ER, the overnight crew seemed fairly insufficient at simple things, like communicating that family members are there, or rehooking a patient back up to monitors and IV's.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec8f4e3dd0d69:0xabe5f655cd2e4f08"}

Ideal for high school kids or single people. Watch your back at night. Start off around $ 7.25 and get a quarter raise if you get hired on. Takes forever to get another raise. Go ahead if you want to settle for that shampoo slave work and don't see any good money. Just enough money to gas your car and pay your phone bill and you might have something left to get groceries. The people that's giving this place 4 and 5 stars either live with momma or just don't have any bills or both. Move out on your own and see what i am talking about. Yeah that's shade I just threw. Go to school, that's what I did and I am a successful cook and barber. Smart people would reach for the stars and not settle for shampoo unless hair washing is involved. Just keeping it 100, something most people need to start doing, instead of minding other folks business before their own. Very messy in that place, I would not recommend my daughter to work there because she would cuss them broads out and drag them like they do on the bad girls club.
