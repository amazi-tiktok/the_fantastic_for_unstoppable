It is a wonderful concept to turn an old mill into various floors of arts and crafts rooms, but the floors are hard to navigate and it has various tripping hazards for older folks.  The only reason for the four stars is that there is a wonderful Kombucha bar - which is the main reason we went.  They craft their Kombucha on site and you can get what they have on tap for the day as well as a flight of each of the four daily choices.  This is worth the visit even if you aren't into crafts.

After visiting several times I've noticed that many of the studios appear to be locked up with no artists in sight, even on a Saturday when most people are able to spend time enjoying the art. Thus, it lacked the bustling art community/marketplace feel that you would expect visiting such a large fine arts venue. Where are the artists? That however is not the fault of Lowe Mill. It's the fault of the artists who must not be starving, lol. The atmosphere doesn't feel friendly, even the woman sitting in the office is unapproachable. Why do people think art and snobbery are interchangeable? Anyway, the main reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the stairwell in the Flying Monkey had such a bad urine smell. It's extremely off putting and screamed trashy for that section of the mill. My 10 year old asked what the smell was.
