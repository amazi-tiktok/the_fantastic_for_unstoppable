After raving about the skill level of the mason that built these fireplaces in 1986 they still came up with several issues that had to be dealt with including cleaning, to the expense of OVER $5,000. We were appalled at the price because we do have some knowledge of masonry. Had someone else come out who said our fireplaces were good to go...did not even need cleaning as they did not appear to ever have been used for wood. I've never had a bid before that I thought was almost criminally high!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891a4f1df93545:0x74862f95b3dad52c"}

I mistakenly texted this company to reschedule my appointment (thinking I had called the other company).  Carmen knew I was not his customer and he took advantage of the situation.  After the inspection and cleaning was done - he would not accept the quoted price of his competitor and made me pay $249.  This was $80 more!!!!  I objected and reminded him it was \"August\" and I was given the $169 quote as a Summer discount.  He raised his voice at me and was completely unprofessional - to the point where I told him to leave.  Lastly, he had me make the check out to him personally, which raises some other questions.
