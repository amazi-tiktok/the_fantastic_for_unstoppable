She apologized and went to tell the manager again. He finally came back and began working with the register without saying a word. It took 3-5 mins of him tapping the register, shaking his head at it, to finally say that he voided it and required my card again.

That has its ups and downs.  Ups sit where you like, not where you are lead.  Down:  The server for that section may not know you are there.  After looking over the menu twice and discussing the options provided, roughly 10 mins; we got approached by the waitstaff for drinks.  The place was not very busy, but there were other folks there.  Got our order in. Eggplant Parm, the Italian, and order of cheese breadsticks.  It took a while for the chow to hit the table.  The Eggplant Parm was a big portion  looked really tasty.  The Italian  was wee for a 8-9 dollar sandwich, i would say less than 6 inches of it total.  The meat cuts were great though.  Cheese bread.... can't tell you just yet, as it has not arrived.  My side salad was fair.  The Greek dressing was really good.  However the onions were old as they had become translucent and the red had seeped into the meat of the veggie. My friend had to get up to get his tea refilled.  The waitress did not even acknowledge that she had not returned with his drink.  I scarfed up my sandwich after removing the onions.  Good, but not valued correctly in my opinion at the cost point.  When i had cleaned up my area, just a thing i do having been a server, my cheese breads arrived.  They came with an apology about a mix up in the kitchen. Things happen.  They were the best thing out of all that was ordered.\n\nWhat this place needs to do to stay alive in a market flooded with food options :\n*know that this place is new and are working on finding their rhythm\n\n1.  Bring on better wait staff, and add another the floor\n2.  Re-evaluate their price points on certain items.  There Special was a great deal!\n3.  Polish the time from order to table.\n\nI will be going back in a month or two to see how things have changed.  It has some great things going for it.

Socialized with friends for a while and saw two missed calls a few minutes later at 6:53. No voicemails but I figured it had to be Domino\u2019s so I called back. Waited for 10 minutes and no one picked up. App said pizza was being delivered. Called back at 7:26 to see where food was. Finally got someone on the phone. The gentleman said he tried calling twice to tell me there were no delivery drivers available. But he could\u2019ve left a voicemail for that! Why did I have to try and call him back for that information? At this point we\u2019re all hungry and now the guests are upset.\n\nSo a few things here:\n1. The app shouldn\u2019t show my food is being delivered when it hasn\u2019t even been made.\n2. I shouldn\u2019t have been able to order delivery if the location doesn\u2019t offer it.\n3. The employee should have left a voicemail with the information and not wasted my time trying to call back for it.\n\nSo be careful using this location. The communication is very poor. Call ahead of time to see if they can deliver. Don\u2019t use the app.\n\nEDIT: Bumping up a star since the manager called me to explain the situation and obviously wants to make things right. I may give this location another try since it seems I caught them in a perfect storm of \"things going wrong\", and being a former restaurant worker myself, I can sympathize.\n\nMy order was flagged for review since it was associated to an address that has been linked to multiple phone numbers. This is a national Domino's corporate policy to keep tabs on potential sketchy orders.\n\nDomino's corporate always expects their franchisees to have delivery drivers, and never anticipates a scenario where a given store has no delivery drivers show up for work. So don't expect the app design to improve, and I can't fault this location for that.\n\nDomino's typically doesn't leave voicemails as they prefer to talk about potential order problems in person, and in my case, try to present an offer for me to pick up the pizza myself. Even so, we'll agree to disagree as the voicemail could have said \"We have no delivery drivers for tonight. Please call us back by X time if you still want the order and can arrange to have it picked up.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1627330944209, "text": "Our team appreciates your review and feedback.

That much was understandable since I know people are having a hard time finding workers. After I called to check on my pizza, she said I needed to place my order again online since she couldn\u2019t apply my coupon over the phone. She told me they now had a driver, and it would be delivered. I order my pizza again and the tracker says it has been delivered. 30 minutes later- still no pizza.

We got back to the hotel and opened the box only to find the greasiest pizza I have ever seen.  The thin crust pizza was as flimsy as a paper towel.

I went to visit Little Caesar pizza place. I ordered one pepperoni pizza and one cheese pizza. There were three females inside of Little Caesar two African American female and one Caucasian female. One of the African American females with a cashier then one day in the African American female in the back and a Caucasian female with making the pizzas. When I place my order Little Caesar around 8:51 p.m. which is the X stamped on my receipt. All of the workers in Little Caesars were on their cell phones or had the above's in the ear. I placed my order with the cashier, then I just watch to see what happened. I washed your Caucasian female put her phone down and take her ear plugs out, then she received it to wash your hands. Then I saw the African American female come from the back aisle set up phone down, but never saw her wash her hands. Then she proceeded to take down crust and lay them flat in trays and place butter on them along with the cheese. Not remember as I stated before, I never saw her wash your hands. Okay so I'll call the Caucasian female to the front and I said excuse me but she did not wash her hands referring to the African American female. Then the Caucasian female he's going to tell me that she washed her hands. The African American female and stated I don't know what you watching me for because I wash my hands. Then she proceeded to use negative language and added to that a very negative attitude. Simply because I requested that they follow safety procedures by washing their hands before touching food. Then the African American female continue to be negative and use and negative body language. I asked for the name of the manager and the district office number. I was told there was no district office for Little Caesar. I was told the manager on duty was the African American woman with the negative attitude and the one that use negative language. I asked who was the owner of this particular Little Caesar on Moffett Road in Mobile Alabama. I was told I think his name is Michael. So you telling me that you're working at a business and you don't even know who you're working for? I tried to reach someone in the office a little Caesar to put this situation. I will continue to reach out to Little Caesar until I get some type of reply. I'm just afraid that the person may not have enough self-control to walk away from someone else being ignorant. So my experience with this little Caesar on Moffett Road and Mobile Alabama was totally negative and I would advise anyone not to go.

Well they didn't lie, a lot more bell peppers, some as long as my finger and as wide as two fingers. And onions, chunks of onion, never separated, just chunks! I took one slice and picked off the onions and peppers, that amounted to a heaping hand full! What was left was a slice with a single slice of pepperoni and about 3peices of sausage and very little cheese. The pizza had no taste other than a watery taste! They should name it the vegan bell pepper and onion TASTELESS PIZZA! As long time customers, needless to say we are very dissapointed! Other pizza resteraunts are pulling similar stunts! So we will not be patronizing little Little Caesars any more! Also the most cheese and peperroni, tastes like it was made with processed cheese covered with a little mozzarella, and few if any more peperroni! It will not melt the cheese when reheated!

Excellent!  We snuck in right before closing and were nicely greeted.  We chose our favorite, the vegetarian pizza.  The white sauce is so yummy, and is one of the special choices that makes this chain great.  It's on about 1/2 of the pizza choices.  Another selling point of this chain is the ability to customize your pizza.  Lots of ingredients you don't see else where- like artichoke hearts. We didn't make the pizza until the next evening's dinner, and it still baked up great - flavorful crust rose nicely and then that great crispy on the outside, somewhat soft on the inside finish.  Wonderful pizza with lots of choices.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918fdac905ef1:0xefa1f40b33e2b782"}

There will be no \"next time\" BOTTOM DOLLAR ON THAT. Horrible experiences at this locations but tonight's interaction burns bridges. Granted, there was inclement weather tonight so some delay and difficulties were expected. However, from what I experienced tonight, Domino's Pizza off of Mobile Hwy would have been better closed. No matter, I ordered from the app and request delivery. I finalized the order on the app but I later received a call from the store, saying they didn't have delivery drivers (again, expected difficulties) and I need to pick up my food. What they didn't tell me is that they voided my app order, placing a hold on my debit card (upcoming 'last straw'), and I would need to bring my debit card to re-order. So, when I arrived at the store, lo and behold. They told me that I needed my card. Thus, I had to drive back through Tropical Storm Sally in a partially wrecked car, just to get my debit card. (Now, given my past dealings with this store, I should have know better but I am a naive person person at times.) I get back to the store, just to find out that because of the order I made on the app, Domino's Pizza tried to charge me twice for the same order. One for delivery and the other for carryout. I snapped. So what? I need to have at least 40 dollars in my bank account to order pizza. I am sorry; your tax dollars don't pay teachers enough for that. I find it really funny that Domino's Pizza can jump into your bank account so fast when you order but, refunding and correcting orders, they feint as bumbling idiots. I do not just hold the store at fault but the entire corporation. They have no regard for customer service; Domino's Pizza only cares about profits and their shareholders. I wouldn't drop or invest a dime into Domino's Pizza, with all the dried and burnt pizzas I have ordered over the years. Hell, Pizza Hut has a hotline for situations like this, but you invest your time in 'Pizza Insurance' and 'HotSpots'. How about fairly selling pizza when trying to double dip into people's bank accounts? How about optimizing your systems so errors like this can fixed quicker? Just go under, already. But, before you do, give me my money back because YOU STILL HAVE NOT DONE THAT YET FOR A ORDER I CAN NOT EAT BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED IT!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586546559560, "text": "Hello Chris, I apologize for your experience and would like to assure you that this is not an automated response and your review is individually read and responded to because we want to make sure your concerns are addressed.

It is about 8 minutes from the store to my office. 1:00 pm, no pizza, 1:10 pm no pizza, 1:25 pm, still no pizza. Called the store. Only have one driver but it'll be out shortly. (Maybe Domino's should consider giving their drivers a living wage so they would stay).1:40 pm, pizza finally shows up at my office. The driver gave me my now cold pizza and seemed a bit miffed that I failed to leave a tip.  Guess I'll wait two more years.

As usual I ordered online and waited 30minutes for my delivery. Although the pizza tracker showed it at quality check phase (the last phase before delivery), I get a dead air call no one said anything. So I called back and get an answer from a rude Adrian screaming and cutting me off because I questioned him about waiting 30minutes to call me to tell me they don't deliver in my area after dark. In which I just received a delivery from them about a week or 2 at this hour ago so I guess it's a new policy, So why was I able to place an order and why was I charged and again 30MINUTES before you call knowing you have an online tracker indicating the steps of my delivery??????? Don't waste your time dealing with these people. It's a hit or miss on the quality of your service or if you'll get your food at all.

I waited another hour and forty minutes, no pizza I proceeded to call over and over again they would not answer the phone.
