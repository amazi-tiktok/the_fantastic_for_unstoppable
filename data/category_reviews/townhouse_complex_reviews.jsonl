The worst thing Shelton Mill ever did was lose Tami and then replace her with this joke of a \"manager.\" She could not possibly care less about the residents than she does now. We have lived in many many rental properties over the course of the last decade due to nature of work, but this experience with Kristi taking over has been hands down the worst and we would not have ever returned to SM had we known she would be the replacement. She lies about things being done (ie: a neighbor was told their filter was DEFINITELY changed when it was clearly COVERED in filth, and Kristi only backed down when the neighbor walked into the office with the NASTY filter as proof), but also just seems to lie a lot in general. When we had to leave for a work move, she spent months telling us she would try to get it rented early, but then listed the unit as available for the month after we had already paid up to. When confronted with that she claimed they were telling people it was ready earlier than what was listed on literally every outlet. Rather than just being honest from the start and saying no I can't (aka- don't want and have no interest in) help you. Her little sidekick in the office is even more useless and twice the nasty attitude. If you call for anything and she happens to pick up, just try again later because she will have no clue what you're talking about and speak to you like dirt. I really don't know what they are paying this girl for at all to be honest. They basically have children running an entire property and they are doing an EXTREMELY poor job at it.\nThe ONLY, and I mean ONLY, good thing left about this place is Makeyma. They are raising rent yearly on absolutely trash townhomes without any updates. Even the brand new one we lived in, and paid ridiculous monthly amounts for (I'm talking we pay less on a 3000 sq ft mortgage than we did here) we found sloppy construction all throughout, cheap paints and carpets, cabinets that were not level, doors that wouldn't shut, etc. When Tami was around, we never had a single issue- any we did have was fixed same day without the side eye and snarky attitude, and this was honestly a wonderful place to live in a great location.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2d1e8f931c5:0x84a5ba34dd595c28"}

Most of the stains I covered with rugs, but I steamed the carpet myself before I moved my stuff in and the water was black.  Additionally, the microwave should have been replaced as well - it was so old that it was a turn-dial style!  The stack washer and dryer they installed was too large and the doors couldn't close, so I kept it shut with a bungee cord.  I had to move out early because I got a job in another state and had to pay essentially an additional 2 months of rent and didn't get my deposit or pet deposit back.  None of this, however, compares to issues I had with my air conditioning.  My air conditioner broke FIVE times over a hot Alabama summer before they replaced the unit.  I had to get very forceful in my emails to have her take my concerns seriously, which is ridiculous.  It's a shame.

The property was quiet and tucked away. My neighbors were all quiet and nobody bothered you. The office staff was nice and worked with me during brief unemployment periods.\n\nThe current management (Anji specifically) is emotionally detached from their residents.

New building paint one time shouldn\u2019t warrant an annual rent increase.\n\nI had someone break into my apartment and the patio door was never really fixed.

With most apartment complexes like this your experience is based on which unit you are in.\n\nOverall decent place, most of the neighbors are nice. But with the nickel and diming people when they leave to the massive increases in rent you could definitely get more bang for your buck and be in a complex that offers more for the same price. Not bad, just not worth the price of admission.\n\nIf you move here get an updated apartment, that will make your stay and time here much better and don't move toward the wooded area or you'll have to deal with critters.\n\nMore detailed review below:\n\nFirst starting with the cons\n\nLots of break ins that have increased over the years even with a Police Officer moving in like a year ago.\n\nParking has its ups and downs. There may be months where there\u2019s plenty of parking and a day later it seems like 100 people moved in and there\u2019s no parking after 6 p.m.\n\nThere are some updated apartments, go with these. The low end apartments are just that, overpriced and low end.\n\n*Original inspection. Pay attention to your original inspection and do not accept anything less than perfect because if you don\u2019t list an item on your list like carpet or something else they will charge you for it when you leave. When I moved in the carpet was horrible. I talked with the front office and have many emails of our exchanges of how bad the carpet was but because I overlooked writing it on my inspection list because we were having the conversation I was charged for it when I left. Mark everything wrong that you see and get them to fix it before you move in and before you sign a lease.\n\nEven in dealing with the carpet costs, I showed Anji from the front office emails I had with her, and other members of staff before I moved in and for 3 years after about how bad the carpet was and I was still billed $80.\n\nIf someone is smoking inside and you live under them, you may smell it coming through the vents.\n\nRent is going to go up yearly that\u2019s just automatic. The price increase can be drastic. It can go as high as 100+\n\nDuring the summer depending on which unit you are in there are tons of bugs because some of the units are by wooded areas. Avoid these if you do not like bugs because the apartments are poorly insulated and bugs will get in a lot. Sometimes roaches but also centipedes and really any creatures small enough to squeeze through cracks.\n\nFridge and stoves are low end and outdated, expect nothing special here.\n\nPros\n\nFront office usually responds really fast to emails and requests\n\nWorkout room but it locks after I think 7 p.m. Other apartment workout rooms that stay open 24-7 and just provide a code.\n\nPool mostly stays clean", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622652621607, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to write this thorough review of your experience.

Still no light in the ceiling in the living room you have to have lamps. I thought there were fireplaces but maybe they were renovated out or it could have been the apartment before that had one. I remember the exact same kitchen and where how much I rent was $535 for that exact same two bedroom two bathroom apartment in 2002 and now it is so much more. They've been renovated based on the pictures and the outside. I guess they got rid of the hot tub because there's a picture where the concrete looks different where the hot tub was and there's just like a table and chairs randomly sitting there. I can't tell you how many nights we sat and talked to people and some of the guys had some drinks and just hung out and before we bought our first washer and dryer me walking laundry down the hill to the same laundry but now there are so many more than there was before. The mailboxes I don't remember being in the same place but the trash still the same. Everything is so much different yet still the same. I can still see every stitch of furniture that we had arranged in that living room bedroom and the second bedroom and the bathrooms and it was good memories even though I hate him. Divorce is never good. Glad it's over. Wish I could afford to live there again. Makes me sad. It was so secluded and that's what I love now about it but at the time nobody could ever find out where we lived because then it was colonial village Rocky Ridge and they didn't have a sign at the foot of the hill like they do now.

Overall, I have loved living at The Verandas. The apartments and townhouse are very well kept and is a very safe area. I definitely appreciate having at least one police officer living at the complex and the staff has great customer service. The apartments and townhouses also seem to be in great condition. However, I do only have two issues that I hope to be resolved. When I call, my messages are only returned maybe half of the time and the parking at the townhouses is VERY limited. Other than those two issues, I highly recommend the residence to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918786568f667:0xea382d4f99097b76"}

Zack is very nice and has been helpful as well. But, I\u2019ve had a rough time with the Manager, Anji.  She\u2019s not truthful at all.  She called me in regards to a pet.  She asked me to come to the leasing office to sign an addendum.  Before I could get there she added $360 to my October rent without me confirming that I had a pet or to sign the addendum she asked to me sign.  She even stated that IF I had a pet that she would break up the $350 pet fee into 3 payments.  She didn\u2019t do that, which is in black and white-Via email.  When I actually moved here my townhome was not complete and she informed me that my rent would not be due until September.  When I arrived home on 9/10/19, I had a notice on my door.  When I called the office to speak with her about it, she blatantly told me that she didn\u2019t confirm my 1st rent due date.  This is so discouraging In so many ways.
