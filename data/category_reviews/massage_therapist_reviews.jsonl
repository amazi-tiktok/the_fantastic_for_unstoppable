After finding his contact information on the A.R.T. providers page, I decided to schedule an appointment.  I was initially hesitant, as I live in Pensacola and would need to drive almost an hour to get to Fairhope.  I can say that each and every trip I make down for an appointment is absolutely worth it.  Unlike other practitioners that I've seen, Dr. Justin took the time to listen to my concerns and give me feedback.  I didn't feel like another patient on the assembly line.\n\nI was also impressed with his ability to provide me with some immediate relief.  Using A.R.T., Dr. Justin was able to help me alleviate some nagging hip flexor pain, and also give me more range of motion in my knee, in one visit.  While some follow-up visits are required to completely alleviate certain issues, I was impressed with how quickly I felt relief.  It was also helpful to know that Dr. Justin was involved in the same workout program as me, so he really understood the nature of my pain.  It's nice to be treated someone who appears to \"practice what they preach\" in terms of living a healthful life.\n\nAnd lastly, the staff at Eastern Shore Chiropractic & Sports Clinic is outstanding.  I'm always greeted by friendly faces when I walk in the door and have never had an issue getting an appointment at a time that is convenient for me.  They are honest, and even notified me of a credit that I had on my account that I was unaware of.  I would whole-heartedly recommend Dr. Justin to my family and friends for any sort of sports-related pain issues.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1439669195772, "text": "ThanksJonathan, we really appreciate this wonderful review.

Broke my left shoulder and compression fractured ALL of the ribs in my back on the left. Never been the same since, and it is a constant pain. The worst is it will cramp up on that side, underneath the shoulder blade, which causes so much pain I cannot sleep or do any activity. Lily massage is my go to for relief on  those occasions. In an hour, the therapist has me loosened up, easily cutting 3 or 4 days off the time required to recover. She seeks out and finds the cramped tissues and works the cramp out. Her massage is like magic, she begins with bearable pressure, and slowly increases until she is deep into the tissue where the pain radiates from, and somehow always manages to give pronounced relief to this hard to manipulate area where my injury gives so much trouble. I go in unable to lift my left arm above my shoulders, and leave with range of motion restored and smooth. A little tender for a day or two, then normal (for me). Before finding Lily massage, those cramps would last 3 or 4 days, then another 3 to 5 days to move freely again.\nWith her skill at massage, instead of a week to 10 days, I am, able to feel better the same day, and a couple days later am back to normal. activities and can sleep at night.\nI highly recommend this place for massage to anyone, especially those with nagging problems due to injury or strain. This woman is most excellent, I would say she is gifted as well as knowing how to properly perform beneficial massage therapy with the least discomfort when one is injured and in pain. Very professional, caring, and skilled. A five star establishment, always excellent results. I've used her 4 or 5 times, and always been well pleased with the results of her efforts.

Temperatures are checked and a form with a series of question regarding symptoms have to be answered before starting your massage. Which gave me comfort knowing that each costumer has to be screened before moving forward. They have each customer wash their hands and escort them to their rooms. The beds and linens in each room smell fresh, are clean and sanitized. Workers constantly wear mask, use gloves and customers are asked to wear masks during their massage as well.\n\nLily was my masseuse and hands down she is AMAZING! She concentrated on areas that I had no idea I had issues with but she found them and worked a little longer in those areas(Shoulders and neck). Which I really appreciate.

She has done an amazing job of tending to those areas based on what I report, and I have always felt comfortable with her and with my ability to let her know how the massage is feeling.\n\nSpeaking of which, I'm an Aspie-- I'm very shy and also very sensitive to sounds and smells, and the Over the Mountain Therapy office caters to sensitivities extremely well. The building their office is housed in is surprisingly modern and well-kept, the elevators seem very new and ride smoothly, and there are clean restrooms located close to the elevators on every floor, as far as I can tell. The actual office space you'll go into has its own door which leads into a cozy common space, so just push the handle with some force and walk in.\n\nInside, the atmosphere is very soothing and easy on people with sensitivities (or anyone who just wants to feel relaxed and spa-like!). The lighting is low and calming, and there are definitely scents, but none are overpowering or headache-inducing. Melody puts some aromatherapy oil near the headrest, and the peppermint has been perfect -- not too strong, even for someone like me.\n\nThe massage room we've used is also incredibly cozy and gentle. The lighting is still kept low, the furniture is cute, and the massage table is SO comfortable. There is a heating pad on it, which feels good and helps keep you warm, and the fabrics are all soft and pleasant to touch. There is nice, soft spa music in the massage room... the whole experience is just highly relaxing.\n\nDefinitely recommend!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891a70cb7331f9:0xb6c8136220b0af73"}

He shows concern and compassion for his patients.  His staff has always been very helpful and they know me  by name, that's always a special touch.\nI love that he has combined the Growing Younger Spa with his Chiropractic Care...it makes it easy to come to one place now. The office is just beautiful!

Was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews but thought would give it a try.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  I called.to make a appt for a other day as it was late.  They said they had a table open so I went on in.  The place is in a small strip mall but most of them here in Huntsville are.  Once you get inside looks like most small massage places.  I have included a few pictures from their website as they are accurate of what you actually see.\n\nThe lady was very nice and very professional.  She gave me a very relaxing massage.  I would have like a little more work on my neck but I did say anything as I wanted to just see what was their normal.  Only other improvement I can think of is she did not do the front of my legs at all.  Since I do alot of lifting and crawling around that is always a sore spot.  But over all I left feeling very relaxed.\n\nI did opt for the shower table as some recommended to get the oil off.  Again very professional and make sure \"everything\" that needed to be covered stayed covered.  Thought it might be awkward but the way she did it made it feel very professional so really did not even think about it.\n\nThe only real negative I can say is the same as of other peoples reviews.  They leave the door slightly open so anyone walking by can see in.  I understand from a security view but the walls are paper thin (like most every other place you get a massage) so you can hear everything so I do not really see that the pros outway the cons for doing this.  I could not really relax and although I really like this place it was the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  It also would be the one thing that made me look somewhere else \u2639.\n\nAlso one note since it came up in some of the other reviews.  No one pressured or even asked me for a tip.  I did give her one as she did a good job but she never asked.  The only thing they asked was if I would like a 4 hand massage (I only booked a 60 min) and when I said not tonight that was that.\n\nOver all a great place and so far I recommend it for a great relaxing massage if you dont mind everyone that walks by your door seeing in \ud83e\uddd0.\n\nWill update if I go back.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA1FbHtCamDoFPPdQMGkYztFVFx2ThZNK83lYB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzJSml9LE8V6WWeNTZyOMMsnBursNL_BGv5fqt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNHV4HZpfhPDmPBQ9S1sMAcpQGLrFHWfO65-f7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1590289416354, "text": "Hello, Terrell.

I was told over the phone that they would not quote me prices because I had little girls getting their hair done so if it was simple it wouldn't cost as much. I also had to give them $100 deposit to hold the reservation (completely understandable until I arrived). One of the stylists was very nice but appeared to be more of an apprentice and had to keep asking for help to do the hair of the 2 younger girls. We were still charged full price for these styles ($75 for a 6 year old and 8 year old). One was a bun and did NOT look good and it didn't even resemble the picture we used. Again, she was very nice but the hair was not close to what we asked for. Two of the styles were supposed to be beachy waves and instead we left with weird curls and half done hair. Both charged $55 and took almost no time making it look even decent. They asked me to send pictures ahead of time for my hair and then clearly had not looked at them. I had to ask multiple times about fixing it (it was for my wedding after all) and while my stylist was nice enough to fix it she did seem VERY annoyed. I left with ok hair that I could live with (not exactly what I had in mind as a bride). And somehow I was charged the same price for mine as the 6 year old flower girl. The owner was pretty rude - she told my sister that she could put the little girls in a room and close the door while we waited. The same girls she charged full price updos for. I guess they were good enough to pay but not make noise in her salon? The last complaint was that the stylists kept stopping with our party to help a mom and bride that were also in the salon.

My cut is pretty simple. At the end of the appointment, Ana Maria informs me that she does not accept credit cards. She did not tell me this when I made the appointment. No one told me this while I was waiting for her to arrive. Instead, I was instructed to go across the street to the ATM. She did have a vague sign posted that she accepted cash or that checks could be made out to her. She did not have any wiring transfer services set up. Those services can be set up in the same time I spent waiting for her to arrive. She seemed to be under the impression that I am here to make her life easier. For 125.00 for cut and color I hoped that she would have made a bit more effort.

Went in today I went in to the salon today after making an appointment.have always put my kids first and haven't had my hair done professionally in years. I came in and was told that they'd be with me in a second. My hair dresser was late and then my name was called and i wasn't introduced. She just walked into the other room.(I wasn't told where to go.) I got to the chair and sat down. She took my purse out of my hands and out of my lap. I guessed she noticed my face when she did that and asked if that was ok. I said it was just never had someone take my purse out from me like that. She asked if I knew what I wanted to do with my hair. I told her I hadn't gone in 5 years and wanted to talk about what would be best health wise to do w my hair w color.she said \"you didn't bring a picture? Or anything? Usually when I sit in a stylists chair I already know what I want to do.\" I said well I thought I could discuss it. I ended up saying blonde highlights. (I probably had an attitude at this point Bc of how she had been toward me.) she hair dried my hair roughly. Then left without saying a word for a couple minutes. Came back and tried ripping off the cape she had on me saying he wasn't doing my hair today. She want use to rude customers... I said she came off very ...she cut me off and said that she was done. I said she was the rude one and went to the receptionist by the door and told them what had happened and one women.(looked like the manager or whatever.) said sometimes ppl don't mesh well but that there were plenty of other salons I could go to. I said \"no sorry?\" ... I told her and the gossipy women around her that I was going to be writing reviews and I left...... Now I have worked in customer service for multiple years and have never been allowed to treat a customer (rude or difficult) in such a manner. I've never had a problem w any other place I've ever been too. Obviously if u want to be treated like you value don't go there. If u want to be greeted nicely or to have a consultation go somewhere else.

Before I start, I would like to mention that my wife is a board certified pharmacist practicing in AL (license number 17856) Chandni Patel Woods- can verify on the Alabama board of pharmacy website. I am a nurse at Grandview medical. This is just to let you know we are professionals and not just some stupid people complaining. We both tip very well--usually over 20% at most places. At her first appt, she showed up to no one being there. So she called the number on her email confirmation and the lady didn't answer. She then called her back 15 more minutes later and told her how she had been trying to find her number \"everywhere\" and couldn't to tell her that she had car troubles and couldn't make it. My wife is way nicer than me so she was like sure no problem. She rescheduled. At her second appt Tiffany asked her if she could answer a NON EMERGENCY phone call and left my wife on the table naked for ten more minutes. The place is sketchy as hell and so you shouldn't be surprised at all that her table didn't have a table warmer and my wife is cold natured. My wife still wanted to tip her after the service and I told her no absolutely not. You could tell she was mad about it---which is why I'm guessing my wife just received an email stating that her next appt (since she purchased 3) was also cancelled but gave no reasoning. It doesn't matter anyways bc we're getting a refund from Groupon for it and I'm making sure I leave a bad review for her wherever I can. Most unprofessional inconsiderate service ever. I surprise my wife with spa days at nice salon/spa places so I don't know why she went and tried to find a cheaper Groupon for massages. I assure you we will be paying full price at a REAL place from now on. And just FYI--usually tip $20 or more per session.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571330301853, "text": "Thank you for the review. We truly appreciate it.

He takes chiropractor care to levels no one has ever heard of in this town. Let's be real for a moment, almost every who's had pain at some point in their life has gone to a chiropractor for help. The standard way of thinking is that if you could just get that elbow to pop back or to have a hip or shoulder reset then all your pain would go away. But it never works, you might find some mild relief but it's usually short lived by a couple of hours to maybe days and then you wake up and say, you slept wrong and it's out again.\n\nWell the team at Invision chiropractic care will teach you how to do address the underlying problems so you can fix it yourself in the long run. Yes you will get adjusted, yes it will probably hurt (Dr. Aplin has a different approach to adjusting that I've ever seen) but I'm a walking, breathing, significantly less pain and overall stress less person than when I walked into his office 4 months ago.\n\nI'll be honest, I have a long history of surgeries to pains and only walked in to this office cause I didn't want to have another surgery and my dear friend suggested Dr. Aplin. I went when I truly didn't believe he was helping. I went when the pain spread to a neighboring body part. I went even though my TOC doc said I needed surgery to fix my problem. 4 months and I never missed an appointment. I can say today that I don't need surgery, my pain is gone and the results of becoming less stressed and worry free was worth more to me than the pain getting better.\n\nBrainTap. Google it. Dr. Aplin introduced me to it and has changed my life because of it. I feel like I have the answer to a life long question that I know so many of us ask \"How do I feel better?\" yes that's generic but let's be honest, everyone is stressing about something these days. But after 4 months of using the BrainTap and doing my homework from Dr. Aplin, I do feel better, lighter able to take on what the world throws at me. It just works!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581024097197, "text": "Lorren - you're a ROCKSTAR!

My daughter was the first of us to use Dr. Mann.  She came in for really bad neck pain and headaches.  Dr. Mann said it was related to what is now being called 'text neck.' In two weeks of treatment she was completely better! Not only that it's been months now and she feels great- and still playing on that phone! The second patient was my son.  We were told he needed tubes in his ears because he had chronic ear infections for months.  It broke my heart thinking about that so I was chatting with Dr. Mann on one of my daughters visits and he told Chiropractic can be successful in treating that without tubes. So we gave it a try (child adjustments are different and very gentle if you didn't know) and low and behold after months of ear infections they were COMPLETELY gone.  We were thrilled- not to mention we saved hundreds avoiding surgery.  The next patient was me!  I do pure Barre and I was having trouble with my low back and knee.  It turns out that I had mobility issues.  Couple weeks of work and my workout is now a breeze. And finally my husband.  He's had back issues before but not quite like this recent one.  He works at a computer all day.  This time the sciatica was going all the way to his foot.  He is currently finishing up his rehabilitation with Dr. Mann and is already pain free!  I am so glad we came here first! No pain, no drugs, we feel great, and at a fraction of the price of surgery.

It looks like it's been said her a 100 times but I wanted to say why my treatments here allow me to say how much I mean that and miss being in Alabama!  I spend most of the year in Atlanta now because of work.  I have tried and tried to find a chiropractor here that was as good as Dr. Mann but I haven't been successful.  I called Dr. Mann before one of my appointments in Atlanta and asked if he would mind talking to my chiropractor (bless him for doing that) Even after an in depth conversation about the type of treatments I was receiving with Dr. Mann in Decatur I still wasn't getting the same level of relief from my Atlanta chiropractor that I was receiving at Advanced Chiropractic.  My neck is just not the same when I go to other places.  I only get to be adjusted a few times a year by Dr. Mann now because of the move and it's one of the worst things about not being home.  But every time  I am in town seeing Dr. Mann is on the list!  Another thing I always appreciated about Dr. Mann's office is there is always a plan.  He doesn't just say 'see ya' at the end of your appointment.  If I am working on an injury I always know when I need to be seen again.  If I am on wellness I know I need to be back monthly.  Other places I have been don't give any direction and it just seems less professional.  Be thankful for what you have here!!! He's the best!

I'm a fan of all things wellness and am a believer that the chiropractor can save you from surgery. I am also very picky about the places I go for treatment and advice. I had just relocated to the area for work.  My supervisor had also just moved here and said I should give this place a try.  I called ahead and asked about the services provided and some questions about my new insurance.  I had my appointment that evening.  The office is more modern looking than some of the other places in town (past experience has taught me sometimes old building means outdated doctor). The staff and doctors are all nice people and I can without a doubt say that was the best treatment I have ever been given.  My last chiropractor was a good friend and great person but was a smaller build. Just guessing but I think that really was the difference in treatments and let me tell you it was significant.

I originally only came here because I had just moved to Decatur and driving to my old chiropractor was getting to be a hassle.

Like I said in just a couple weeks I could see the changes. I used 2 feel tingling from my back almost weekly. I now haven't felt it in weeks.

Somehow during the move I hurt my back so badly that I couldn't move.  I had always had a chiropractor in Nashville but obviously that was no longer a choice.  So I got on my phone and began searching for a local one.  My chiropractor back home told me to find one that was 'up to date' and that it might be hard to find in a smaller city like Decatur.  I found advanced chiropractic and checked the website.  I found that they do a lot more than just heat and adjust their patients.  I called and scheduled an appointment the same day. The office is very modern looking and Dr. Mann may be even more knowledgeable than my last chiropractor.  I'm already feeling much better.

Attempted to realign a part of my body that didn't need it and when he was done after 6 minutes in the room with me he managed to not fix the issue at all now I'm out over $100.00 and absolutely  no relief for a simple pinched nerve, oh but he did set me up on the \"maintenance plan\" which is 3 visits a week at $65 per visit that's $780 a month! That's more then my mortgage for what every single other chiropractor has been able to fix and treat in one visit for under $50.00. Please be wise and heed this as a warning. I do not recommend this place for anyone. They may be a legal D.C. but it's as close to a scam ad you can get legally.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546567115350, "text": "Kris- you are being dishonest. Health expenses without insurance can be tough, but that is no excuse for your dishonesty in your review. Cameras show your time in the office was approximately 40 minutes; less than 5 minutes in the waiting room- standard for any first visit. Furthermore, we offer the lowest cash prices for new patients in town and also very flexible payment plans.  You were told the prices before you came in. Our cameras even show you were in high spirits until it was time to pay your bill.  And instead of talking to us and working out a payment plan we watched you go into your car and leave this angry review.  Also, what you tried to tell us was \u2018wrong\u2019 with you was actually incorrect and probably the main reason you\u2019ve had to deal with your back pain for years instead of actullay being \u2018fixed.\u2019 While we have great respect for you and your field, you have to remember- you are not a doctor-  for instance a chiropractor in a car accident should heed the EMT\u2019s instructions because that is what they have been trained to do.  You are also confusing your terminology- maintenance is for wellness patients- and is an optional once a month visit for those who have complete their \u2018rehab\u2019 plan to help stay ahead of injuries and reduce wear and tear on the body. Rehab plans are what you were trying to quote. Certain injuries take time to heal and a proper plan for recovery. You are absolutely right Kris- We do things different at Advanced Chiropractic.  We get so many patients who have seen chiropractors that take shortcuts to treat their injuries and the patient continues to deal with pain for years.  Our goal at Advanced Chiropractic is to HEAL the injury. We have found that if we simply make pain go away we are no different than a pain killer or opiate.  However, with our custom made rehabilitation plans you can escape that continued damage, year after year, which is so important as many parts of the body don\u2019t grow back when you repeatedly injure them."}, "gmap_id": "0x886284764f6fef61:0x2058cd07a41eab07"}

We strive to carefully listen to our clients during the scheduling process in order to match them with the therapist best suited to help them achieve their goals for their session and during the intake process to make sure we go over expectations right before the session begins. The therapist we scheduled you with is used to working with athletes and has sports massage and myofascial release technique training which both use Deep Tissue work, but sometimes this doesn't necessarily translate into what a client would call or expect as Deep Pressure. I would love to talk with you and set you up with myself or a different therapist to make things right and to see if we can meet your expectations.

She was diagnosed with having excess fluid on and around the eardrum, a condition which causes hearing loss and typically causes ear infections. We had taken her to an ENT and pediatrician, and both recommended surgery to put tubes in to help drain the fluid off her eardrum.\n\nAfter her diagnosis, we visited Dr Mix twice a week for adjustments at approx 2 months old. In only a months time, we have seen vast improvement.  Her last ENT visit was a couple of days ago. She finally passed her hearing exam for the very first time in both ears!!! There is still a small amount of fluid remaining, but our ENT detected a noticable reduction in the amount, and has postponed the need for tubes.\n\nWe will continue to seek weekly treatment with Dr Mix, and are so happy that his treatments allowed us a non-invasive approach to restore our  baby's hearing. Dr Mix has been wonderful to work with through such a difficult time. He has taken extra care to go over computer readings with us that have  conclusively shown the gradual improvement at each stage as well. My daughter  has smiled and cooed through every adjustment (no, they don't hurt AT ALL). As a side benefit, one of the computer screenings showed she also had a vertabrae out of alignment which can affect digestion as well. After her adjustments we have also seen improvement in this area also.\n\nParents, DO NOT HESITATE to schedule an appointment for your babies and children at this office. Both Dr Mix and Yvonne are wonderful to work with, and show genuine concern for us at each visit. The office is super clean, and has very up to date equipment too.

We had a consult where my stylist Tammy asked about my preferences, lifestyle, and schedule to make sure she could suggest appropriate styles that would look good at home.

Unfortunately, Olivia A. Salon is not the place for me.  I went in for an acrylic fill with gel on top and while everyone was friendly  I left unhappy with my nails.   The result was chunky, overly thick, and uneven.  It looked worse than press on nails glued and painted by a child.  The nail technician did NOT use a drimmel or motorized file but used a foam hand file to take off my existing and layer of acrylic.\nAt first this seemed nice but I was mistaken.  She was unable to file the smaller sectional of my nail bed and ended up filing skin which hurt.  My nails were embarrassing to look at as they appeared malformed and lumpy.  When she applied the gel she used 3 very thick coats of color that didn't dry under the light and were soft to the touch.  To be fair, I'm picky with my nails and when I saw the manicure going south I didn't say anything.  I should have.  Instead I left and went straight to another nail salon.  At the next salon they showed my Quasi-Modo nails around and laughed.\nThe salon itself is easy enough to find but the level of aesthetics is less than what I like.  They clearly want to be a high end salon but the quality is not quite there.  In addition, the prices were NOT worth it!  They charged $10 over what any other salon does.  The people were nice and they fit me in.  And I want to make it clear, I did not say anything to the lady.  But I'm not sure that she would have been able to fix them even if I had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b80bb327d0d:0x763a472c8ef66bd8"}

I've been a client for several years and I have been extremely pleased with my services and the owner Mike, he is very sensitive to your massage needs and he will make sure someone will get you in one of his 3 different massage parlor's in Birmingham. Mike is very knowledgeable in massage therapy and with a pandemic going on with the cornavirus, I was very hesitant in going to get a massage but Mike reassured me and answered all my worries, the therapist take their own temperature and shows you their temperature,  they also take the clients temperature, hand washing, rooms and tables are sanitized along with mask being worn by both the therapist and the client. The Tao location is very clean with a comfortable atmosphere, they are all very professional. I can't say enough about Simon, he is one of the best massage therapist I've ever came in contact with,  he's very professional, covers your entire body head to toe, applies the right amount of pressure and will adjust according to your preference, he's very knowledgeable about the anatomy of the muscles and will apply the amount of pressure and hits all the pressure point's, their prices can't be beaten, I always get a 3 hour deep tissue massage and I'm never disappointed, the money is worth every penny. I work in the medical field and have herniated discs with sciatica, I'm always on my feet and Simon knows every spot to hit, his hands are magical and it de-stresses me.I recommend any of Mike's parlor' s if you get a chance to go ask for Simon he is awesome and you couldn't ask for anyone better than Simon. Mike has a great business, I don't think I've ever had to make an appointment they say come on in and they will get you seen by a therapist, Mike will always do his best to accommodate you and your schedule. 5 star service!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917ae03e50bcd:0x5719a7c375d783e0"}

First of all, my wife happily reported that all the attendants were very nice.  The day started out at 10 sharp - \"not!\"  The first half of the day was dedicated to a massage and body scrub; something I thought would be a good experience.  The masseuse was a man, which in itself is kinda weird, but acceptable for a massage.  He was very professional my wife reported.  Next came \"the body scrub!\"  Now, I don't know about this stuff too much, but I would assume not too many men would take advantage of this service, thus leaving the target clientele women.  Another safe assumption that if your target audience are women, one would assume another women would be performing the services - WRONG!\n\nNow picture this; a 50-ish woman married for 36 years (remember, this was suppose to be a nice experience), who is now attended to in a most intimate manner by a man - who was professional, but a man non-the-less!  To add insult to injury, Plush Medical Spa seemed to find it appropriate to hand my wife a couple of hand towels to cover \"the girls upstairs\" and the \"lady parts\" down below.  My wife is trim enough, but nobody in the 50's have the body of an 18 year old; \"nuff said!!\"  Can you imagine the absolute shock my wife had when the man straddled the table and explained to her how to get ready for the \"scrub;\" to put the HAND towel between her legs like a daiper, and further cover the \"upper girls\" somehow.\n\nI'm starting to wonder \"in just WHAT universe does this even seem appropriate??  My wife was extremely uncomfortable, but was \"rolling\" with it!  The indignation of it is beyond compare, and my wife was horrified.  After the \"scrub\" the same man has to wash my wife down, because they don't have a freaking shower in the place; \"SERIOUSLY!!\"  How can this even be possible?  Only at Plush Medical Spa apparently!!!!\n\nShortly after that, was the \"included lunch\" consisting of a salad from the next door eatery.  Now you would think that being a spa, there would be a nice area set-aside for a respite from the \"pampering?\"  NO, they handed her a take-out, styrofoam container, with plastic utensils, while sitting on a pedicure bench getting the \"full treatment!\"  You gotta be kidding me!!!!  I paid an awful lot of money for this \"experience!!\"\n\nDuring the pedi and manicure, my wife questioned the sanitation of the equipment, at which the attendant stated \"it was in barbasol; a sanitary solution!  My wife has several friends who own salons, and KNOWS that barbasol should be a deep-blue color.  Plush's barbasol resembled the feigning remains of a 30 day-automatic flush, toilet bowl cleaner, at day 45 after installation.  The blue color was almost non-existent!\n\nAfter that was make-up.  The technician was about to apply it with \"VERY\" used brushes, at which my with questioned it.  The girl then said, \"well we use disposable brushes around the eyes and mouth!\"  My wife made sure of that!\n\nFor the price I paid, I was expecting a very nice experience for my wife.  But when she picked me up after work, I sensed something wrong, as I got into the car, I asked how it was, at which point she burst out crying, hugging me closely and thanking me for the gesture, but saying \"it was a horrifying experience of my life!!\"  I felt utterly and totally betrayed.  After several hours of sadness she seemed to regain a sense of normalcy, but the nice relaxed, and pampered experience leading into a lovely evening, \"didn't happen!\"  I am so sorry I ever thought it would be a good idea to \"surprise\" my wife.\n\nYou have been warned!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88929279c8e3b1df:0xa26c5c20ba70a344"}

Sherri is the best masseuse I have ever used. With the warm bed, hot towels, lemongrass aroma, calm music, dim candle lighting - you will not want to leave. Trust me. Give Sherry a try. You will be amazed. Its nice to find someone who actually cares about the physical and mental well being of her clients.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3a3cf9ec3fd5:0xd05855b51e299394"}

I was going came in town to visit for a month after traveling for 3 months straight.  He thought this would be a good idea for me to relax.  When I received the groupon via email,  I called to schedule an appointment (as suggested on the voucher) but I just got the voicemail.  I called a few times over the next couple days because I actually wanted to talk to a person.  But after no response, I followed the instructions from the voicemail, which was to go online to check availability.  Only to find out that the next available day was in September 2017 (4 months later).  I immediately tried to call groupon to get a refund, because I definitely didn't want to wait 4 months for a massage.  However, Groupon was not able to refund me because it was day 4 since he purchased the Groupon.  They have a policy of a 3 day return.  They were not understanding and didn't care to hear my story.  I decided to try calling LeAnne again, but of course there was no answer.  I left numerous messages and she finally called my back 3 days later.  When she called, my intent was to explain my story to her and advise her I would be there for the next month to see if she could squeeze me in anytime within the next few weeks.  She said rudely said she couldn't and advise me to tell my boyfriend to give the groupon to someone else to use.  I made a suggestion to her to possibly disable her Groupon option until she's caught up, because I'm sure I am not the only potential long term customer with the issue.  She proceeded to rudely yell and tell me that she's backed up because of Mother's day and she doesn't need anyone telling her how to run her business.  Ironically this is the same place I purchased a Groupon for my boyfriend (with a different person) and he had a great experience.  Which is why he decided to do the same for me.  At the end of the day I will never give this place my money again and I will tell everyone I can the same.

I do stay booked out anywhere from 10-14 weeks in general for new clients.  I called the person back as soon as she left a voicemail. I explained to her that if she calls and doesn't leave a voicemail that we don't know someone has called. The client wanted to know about how much money I make and I did tell her it was none of her business as it was also none of her business my relationship with Groupon which stands at 4.7 stars out of 5. I am sorry she feels this is rude, but I find it extremely rude for a stranger to try and tell me how to run my business. As a self employed person not having an opening 2-3 months out  means that I am employed, and that is a good thing. Groupon helps bring new clients in that I hope will become regular clients. I stay booked and I can't fit someone in because they are only going to be in town for a short time that just is what it is. That wouldn't be fair to all the people who wait the standard time for the great deal that Groupon is and I have done over 1500 Groupon massages in the last 3+ years. The person  begins the complaint by saying she was only going to be in town for a month and then talks about how she wouldn't be coming back. If she is only visiting for a short time it sounds like she wouldn't be coming back anyway. I find that most people who leave bad reviews it is because they couldn't bully their way into getting their way and try and get me breaking tmy best practices and rules. The fine print of the Groupn says by availability only. My schedule is online for the whole world to see. The lady wanted me to give her a refund and I told her no bc she didn't buy anything from me she bought a product from Groupon and I do not get all the money from the product. The woman then started asking how much I make  and that was when I told her it was none of her business which it wasn't. Being a therapist who is booked out means I am good at what I do. Groupon is to bring in new clients, not for your next day massage. I tried to help her and offer suggestions but she just wanted to be mad."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c297d793fa07b:0x75b689bc0f9acea4"}

I bought a Groupon deal for two hour long massages. The first one was great but the second one never happened because LeAnne decided to \"leave and go run errands\" because I was 10 minutes late. Even though I called the business and left a message saying I was on my way, LeAnne informed me it is her normal practice to immediately leave the building and run errands if a client is not on time. She then told me I should have called her cell phone (which is not listed on the website or business door) instead of the business number.\n\nI have never heard of such! If I have ever been late for a massage anywhere else, the therapist would simply subtract that time away from my appointment. I had taken off work to make this appointment, since this location doesn't offer hours that are convenient to people who work a 9-5 job. It's clear that customer service is not valued here so I will not spend my money at this place again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487023681813, "text": "I wish to state that this client was a repeat client. She had been told upon her first visit to Peaceful Solutions that the office phone was just used to collect voicemails and given a business card with the cell phone number on it. The day in question I waited on the client for 20 minutes including calling the number given. The client did not show up. When a client is 20, not 10 minutes late it is my policy to consider them a no show. This was the second of a 2 massage Groupon deal, and the client states she got a great massage the first time. To give me 1 star because I upheld the company policy of not giving away free massages when people do not follow instructions is her prerogative, but she is the one missing out on great massages, and as for our hours of operation, I am a massage therapist of 20 years experience so no I don't work late or on the weekend, I work 9-5 like most working people because I too have a family to take care of.

Even if you are young you need, in my opinion, to know how your body is! I wished someone had told me what my back looked like. This damage was done 20 yrs or so ago. I have been to another Chiropractor and they didn't tell me. Also, He has also helped my son, daughter in-law, grandson, and even my 6 month old granddaughter. The staff is very friendly, flexible with scheduling, helpful. My daughter in law contacted the office for me, for my first appointment, and they responsed promptly. I am so Glad Laura suggested him to me. \ud83d\ude00", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

The last time I can remember going to a chiropractor was in 2004 and I honestly never had a bad experience, however, I also never had an experience that  benefited me enough to continue the care.  I became skeptical of chiropractors, skeptical of orthopedic practices, and skeptical of the health industry in some respects.  After unsuccessfully managing my pain due to a shoulder injury, arthritis, and degenerative issues, which all became more acute within the last 15 months, I decided to seek out an alternative to surgery and medications.  Chiropractic care resurfaced as a suggestion to me by a co-worker and I begin to search the local area for a destination to try to combat my persistent and nagging pain and discomfort.   I chose to meet Dr. Kristoffer Johnson based on the hundreds of successful reviews, his experience, and the overwhelming positive welcoming by team members, Bethany and Amy.    They are truly a team that works in unison.  They are truly invested into their patients health improvements and well-being.  They are truly honest, caring people that serve and make a difference in many, many lives.   Another MOST wonderful experience with Back on Track is that a planned number or subscription of visits was not prescribed to me like so many outlets build their potential success around.  \"Let's get you better.\"   I can tell you Dr. Johnson, Bethany, and Amy, more than once, have iterated this as their focus and I am truly blessed and thankful to report that my health has improved.   The combination of therapy services and adjustments is not only beneficial to my physical well-being, it is mentally enabling as well!   On top of that,  I enjoy reading the blog posts on the website and educating myself with what Dr. Johnson's shares through his many years of experience.   After the first week of therapy and adjustments the agony of my discomfort started to go in a different direction.  Halleluiah!   Several weeks of consistent therapy and adjustments is proving to be the best thing I could have invested in for my overall health.   I am confident and positive that I am now \"Back on Track!\"   Thank you Dr. Johnson, Bethany, and Amy!!   I am very much encouraged and looking forward to continuing this health building relationship!  Many Blessings!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

The location is perfect and within minutes from my job.  I contacted them via email and got a response and appointment very promptly.  When I arrived for my first visit, I was in so much pain and couldn't turn my head to the left side. The staff (Amy and Beth) always greets you with a smile, warm conversations and pleasantries making you feel super special... they are absolutely outstanding professionals.. Also the atmosphere is pleasant, friendly and welcoming...almost heavenly.  Dr. Kris Johnson is an awesome guy!! The fact that you're not waiting around all day to be seen..  He takes time to explains your conditions/situations/issues and recommends a plan of action as to how he will work to get you some relief and feeling better.  See, I took a nasty fall down my basement stairs that resulted in several vertebrae out of alignment. By my third visit, the pain was down 2 scales (from 10 to 8) and now, after my 8th visit, I'm down to 5 more scales with some occasionally shoulder pain but no more numbness in arm or tingling in left hand.  I'm able to turn my head all the way to the left side with no pain and move my neck up and down freely. On top that, I'm  not having to pop pain pills...icing the area once or twice a day does the trick. I didn't intend to write such long review but I am reminded that the Word of God tells us to give honor where honor is due.  I 100% believe Dr. Johnson and his staff really deserve such worthy praises and recognition for what they're doing not only in my life but others everyday.  My prayer is that God continues to bless and prosper them and this wonderful Chiropractic office for many, many years to come.\n\nThank you,\n\nCindi Smith", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

I'm a 30-year old, active female that had never experienced back pain! I had been experiencing a sudden onset of sharp pain in my lower back that became debilitating (a few hours after moving my Christmas tree, or so I thought). I'm a RN, so i knew to do the basics of applying ice/heat, resting, numbing creams, OTC pain meds, massage, etc. Although these methods provided some relief, it was temporarily. I was regaining some mobility, but nowhere near my baseline! I was having pain upon bending, walking, lying on my stomach and back, and even sitting. My coworker recommended that I come to Dr.Johnson at Back on Track. I decided to give it a try because my methods were not working. What a great decision! The customer service i received  was EXCELLENT and the atmosphere in the office was very inviting and calming!  I received my services with little to no wait time, which is very rare for visiting a doctor's office. The ENTIRE staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and encouraging! I received a tour of the facility and how each product/machine worked, education on what to expect, what to do to assist with my treatment upon leaving, and most importantly a remarkable service. I literally went from requiring assistance because of extreme pain and discomfort when sitting up to sitting up without assistance, IN MINUTES!!! Although I do have to return to the office for continued therapy, I immediately felt the benefits of my visit. I'm so thankful I decided to come to this office.

I had started a new job and my whole body was basically screaming in pain. I was eating Tylenol like candy and would spend nearly all day at home in bed so I could withstand an entireshift standing and bending. I knew I had a problem whenI went to Target and spent  $46 on different muscle rubs. So I made the call and scheduled my massage appointment.                           I came to Zen Massage and was immediately put at ease once I came inside to wait for my appointment. There was very soothing music playing and the business was very dim and relaxing. I wish I knew what kind of essential oils  they were using, it was a combination of different ones and smelled divine. I opted to do the 60 minute full body massage becauseI knew I had a lot of stiff problem areas. I decided that if I liked liked the results, I would come  back  to have my feet worked on, my main issue was my lower back. I was apprehensive because I had never had a full body massage where I neededto remove my pants and shirt before. I covered myself with a sheet and Marie went to work, starting on my back. At first, I was tense, but I gradually relaxed because I am overweight and insecure.  Marie used the perfect amount of pressure, not too soft nor too rough. She kneaded out all the knots in my upper back I was not aware I had. What was crazy was Marie cracked my neck by not touching my neck at all. She was working on the left lower hip when I heard my neck crack twice. Now that is talent! Marie used her knees and forearms to knead out everything in my body that hot baths, store bought muscle rubs, and over the counter pain medication  could not alleviate. She is a true professional and knowledgeable about body mechanics. I was in agony every single day before I visited and now I feel wonerful . My body feels 19 years old again and limber. Marie used some kind of rub or oil that had a slight heat and pleasant smell, much better then the Ben Gay I had been using. She also used some strangle technique where she pressed on certain points in my ankle and I felt a release of numbness in my feet with instant relief. Amazing! I recommend anyone wanting to feel physically better immediately check Zen Massage out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d8f9dfc8ba5:0x4b7d4ddbaac8bbc9"}

It was not at all what I expected but it was much better! I\u2019m used to traditional American style massages. When you go in it\u2019s got a doctor office kind of feel. You have to fill out a form explaining the pain and symptoms you have. Marie was my massage lady. The first 15 minutes I wasn\u2019t so sure if I was loving it. Probably because I was so tense it felt like it would never get to the feel good part. I have fibromyalgia, which makes everything hurt. Once she loosened me all up she really focused on my sore spots. She didn\u2019t talk unless I talked to her which was great because I like it quiet. I was surprised that she was on the table too for most of the massage. The last 15 minutes she spent stretching me all out, which was great. She used something like icy hot on my back and used hot towels after to wipe it all off. Here\u2019s a slight warning for anyone not knowing how it will be... it\u2019s not for people who are physically shy! I was just in underwear and a few of the stretches involved her moving me into odd positions. Ladies, be prepared to have your top half exposed a bit. It was very professional though and I feel about a million times better now. I\u2019ll be back on a regular basis.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d8f9dfc8ba5:0x4b7d4ddbaac8bbc9"}

Didn't ask what we were looking for in the experience , expecting, what hurt ,or to clarify what we wanted. They talked so much between themselves we couldn't relax. Or even talk to eachother . every time we tried to communicate they would just ask if we were ok. And that's it. Even when we talked to eachother they would interrupt and just say you ok ? It seemed like it took longer than 30 min. But I didn't see or have a clock to keep up. Got done and realized it took an hour. So I asked about it. And they told me that it was what I wanted. But i took blame and paid for it. Then they demanded a tip. Even before I could pay for just the massage.  Even got beligerant to a point. And it had to be 10 apiece.

You can't see my eyelids at all and I can't raise my eyes up. Instead of looking better for my trip I looked awful with my nearly closed eyes. Everyone that knows me asked what did you do to your eyes??? Thank GOD Botox does not last to long and I'm praying this is a temporary result that will go back to normal.

I found Jason when I was around 35 because I was working a job that required alot of lifting and carrying of a 28 foot extention ladder over long distances about 15 times a day. I had gotten to the point that it caused me such pain to even bend over to tie my shoes that I couldn't take it.\n\nI found Dr Hart at Sturbridge on Taylor Rd. I saw him therethere for a few years and I followed him after he left to start his own practice because he was the most skilled Chiropractor I had ever been to see, but also because of his regard for people and how he saw the way their wallets and insurance plans were treated. What I mean there without going into a full out explanation is, Dr Jason Hart is one of those doctors you rarely find, he cares much more about you and your well being than he does about your wallet.\n\nI'm 45 now and had it not been for Jason and the lengths he goes to for his patients/friends, to learn his craft inside and out like no other.....well I would still be suffering day to day with a great deal of pain.

I went in with some tension in my shoulders and upper back (pregnancy during a pandemic can be stressful \ud83e\udd23) so I called prior to my appointment to ask if the prenatal massage could be customized and if I could have more of a focus in that  area rather than in my lower back that typically accompanies pregnancy. Of course, the ladies up front that answered my call were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to check with the therapist instead of just placating me with some generic answer. They were also very friendly and professional when I arrived.\nOnce it came time for my massage, Tara explained everything first and made me feel completely at ease and comfortable. I did add on the Lavender aromatherapy and wondered if it would be worth it or not due to wearing a mask. It. Was. Worth. It. Just do it. You won\u2019t regret it. The massage itself was excellent and met all of my standards. There was a time or two that I almost felt like asking her to move on to a different area because the pressure was beginning to be too much for me (it was a good hurt, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just a wimp), but it was almost as if she was so in tuned with me that she moved on before I got to that point. At checkout, they were offering  a wellness package, and while I passed on it due to the fact that I\u2019ll be having a baby soon and won\u2019t have the availability for a while, it is definitely something I\u2019ll consider in the future.

She moved on to the other areas in my back, legs, and feet which felt really good, but she had spent so much time on the shoulder area, that I felt those areas did not get as much attention as they needed.

I have signed up for a directory service to give clients direct access to an appointment specialist or to me. Hopefully the recorded options won't just annoy people.\n\nI apologize for the extended hold time.  I understand how frustrating it is to be left on hold and am so sorry you experienced it when calling us.  I contacted my answering service to find out why you were left on hold so long and to find out if this is a regular thing and I'm just now finding out about it.  What I found out is that what you experienced is not common.  I'll try to explain why it happened below.  Please note; it's an explanation, not an excuse.\n\nThe answering service was able to determine which number called twice and was left on hold, so I have your number, but I don't want to call you in case the call would be unwelcome.  I'd like to make it up to you by offering 30 minutes free to make up for the hold time.   Once again, I'm terribly sorry and will try to limit the chances of it happening again.\n\n(1) Not all their operators can make appointments for us.  Our answering service does not just take messages,  they give information, make appointments, and take credit card information.  In order to keep errors down, they have certain people who are allowed to make appointments and take credit card info, so when you call and want more than information, and one of those people is on the phone, you will have to wait until one of them is free.\n\nWe keep our prices competitive with independents rather than spas by not paying for a receptionist.  Our clients have consistently said they'd prefer to wait 2 min on hold with our service than get my voicemail and have to wait for me to call back (The average hold time when one of our specialists is not available is 1.9 min.  Most of the time someone can take the call right away.)\n\n(2)  They had a couple of our appointment specialists call in sick, so the pool of people who could take your appointment was reduced.\n\n(3)  You called at 5:05:31 and 5:12:05.  Their peak call time is 4:30-5:30 and with several people out sick their hold time was longer than usual. As I said, I will try to make myself available during this time to reduce the likelihood of being placed on hold in the future.\n\nJenae"}, "gmap_id": "0x888918bb2ec6e57d:0x1a53ce7ffe081b00"}

They both were able to work deep and get to my problem spots that nobody has ever been able to work out before. They were also able to see how I work certain muscles, and the stresses they are under during the massage, which impressed me greatly. Especially April, in knowing the special circumstances with injuries I've had on my legs. I would highly recommend Stellar Massage to anyone, especially for deep tissue and neuromuscular therapy. If you tell them you want deep tissue, you're going to get an intense deep tissue massage. Which is exactly what I enjoy. I haven't tried them for a relaxation massage as of yet, but I plan on doing a couples massage with my wife very soon, and I'm certain it will be equally impressive.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1373596212731, "text": "Thank you Bo, we were very happy to have you in.

I called their office first thing (8am) and explained my illness to Debra and informed her I would like to reschedule. She gave me several run-arounds concerning why even though I was sick I could not reschedule. Even so much as stating the owners are the reason why if a patron feels ill they still have to be serviced. She then said half of my Massage Envy points banked for today\u2019s service would be expensed because of the same day reschedule. I asked what concessions are made for feverish patrons. She said they are still required to show up and Massage Envy would take their temperature. I told her I would be going to the doctor\u2019s office today and could provide an excuse. She said a manager would get back with me today, but no one ever contacted me. After having my suspicions proven that I had been lied to and no one would contact me, I called back to ask about what was the current status of my appointment/points. I was then informed the appointment was taken off the records and all of my points for today\u2019s session had been expensed. I am extremely frustrated with their \u201ccustomer care\u201d. I feel lied to and with their \u201cCovid protocols\u201d that were exhibited today first-hand to me, I will NEVER feel comfortable patronizing them again.

I notified the receptionist who put a note in the system. I thought maybe I had a one time bad experience, since the rash seemed to go away, so I went back the following month. I got another rash but this time it spread up and down my arms. My doctor told me it looked like a fungal infection but to be safe she would refer me to a dermatologist. I got a doctors note stating I needed to refrain from massages until the dermatologist could determine what the rash was and if it was safe to go back. I took my doctors note and filled out a membership cancellation form. I noticed my monthly fee was withdrawn after I had submitted the form so I called. I was told my cancellation was denied because I needed a note from the dermatologist. I can\u2019t get a dermatologist note for another month when I have my appointment but even so, why is my doctors note not enough? According to their cancellation policy a note from a doctor stating one cannot be massaged for medical reasons should suffice. The manager didn\u2019t even have the decency to call me! I only found out because I called them. I am out $130 and still have one more month before my contract is up. Not to mention the doctor bills. Do not go here!

I bought a groupon for 100 units of dysport thinking that 100 units instead of 50 would be ample. I was a bit concerned when the nurse tried to confirm that I was a getting 50 units. I asked the doctor's advice about the coverage, and she did not indicate I would need to buy more units. It has been about a month, and I still have movement in all areas injected.  The wrinkles aren't as strong but still there.  Also the areas over the corners of my brows were not treated, and I have this strange Spock look when I raise my brows. Of course, I called after about 2 weeks to let them know that the treated areas still had a lot of movement, and they quickly explained that they do not do any re-treatment with Groupons.  I understand that I  supposedly got a \"deal\" but I also still paid for a service and was assured when I booked my appointment that I would love the results.. I know Groupons are to get new customers in the door but with this experience, I will not go back. I have used a Groupon at another spa, and they re-treated me to get the results that were expected.  I had an appt with my dermatologist a few weeks after this, and she said that 100 disport units should have taken care of all the areas I had treated. My experience may have been completely different if I had paid full price.  Lesson learned.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893ddfc9c8f0f5:0x1921265d80499344"}

I had a GroupOn voucher & was a little concerned that I may be shortchanged because I was there on a \u201ccoupon\u201d.  All my fears were immediately put to rest from the initial phone call to make my appointment.  I had let time get away from me and had less than a week to use my GroupOn voucher or lose the promotional value.  The lady on the phone, Katrina I think, was understanding & made me an appointment for the next day.  Bonus point because I was able to get my appointment on a Saturday.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was greeted by name & offered a drink.  After paperwork, I was introduced to Jennifer Pyles who explained that she is double licensed and would do both my massage & facial.  I was extremely pleased with this because it allowed me to stay relaxed throughout the treatments and not have to move into a new area.  Jennifer was professional, attentive & through.  Her pressure level was perfect & she checked in occasionally to make sure it stayed that way.  She even surprised me by telling me she could tell I was right handed & spent a lot of time at a computer due to the tension level in certain areas.  That really showed me how skilled she is.  After the massage, Jennifer moved directly into my express facial.  She walked me through the process & gave me a brief skin analysis.  She suggested products & services I could benefit from.  She was also kind enough to suggest some over the counter products when I asked about them.  After the appointment, she left a list of the items & services we discussed at the front desk for me.\n\nAfter my time with Jennifer, I was allowed to wait in the sauna while the nail technician finished with another client.  The temperature was just right for relaxation and I had to avoid nodding off.\n\nNext, Badri Roshan, the nail technician came to get me for my manicure.  She was a very nice lady with whom I enjoyed talking.  I loved her accent & chatting with her about her background and what drew her to Birmingham.  As a testament to her work. I have received several compliments on my nails.\n\nAs I checked out, I neglected to get the name of the lady at the front desk but she was very friendly and helped me run my card to leave a tip for Jennifer & Badri.  I loved that while I was invited back, no services or products were pushed on me.  I am looking forward to all my future visits and spreading the news that Azia Medical Spa is money and time well spent!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893ddfc9c8f0f5:0x1921265d80499344"}

So I purchased a very expensive perfect package for my girl as a surprise Valentine's day present at this location bc ive sent her here once before and she seemed to enjoy it. Well the lady at the desk inquired on who it was for and apparently submitted the information under her name where as MY email confirmation went directly to my girl, where she called me informing me she knew my plans for her, spoiling the surprise!!! That should have never happened! I then called and explained my irritation and informed them I was coming for a refund. They called me back like it was no biggy like cool we can just refund this over the phone for you rather than saying hey i'm sorry is there any way we can make this right for you! I'm a funny, chill laid back dude, but if you ruin a surprise, that is my one and only immediate heartbreak bc that ruins the joy of spending lots of money to be able to see the expression on your womans face of how happy she is. Presents are for the givers and for the receivers bc we both enjoy feeling the happiness of THE SURPRISE!! Please resolve this issue, bc i'm a man of morality bc now my woman is upset with me bc I refunded the package but I simply can NOT do business with folks that aren't in it for the satisfaction of those spending their hard earned money! So now, I had Valentine's all planned out perfect to the T, I no longer have the \"kaboom\" gift available, and now there is all this negative energy between me and my woman bc I know she still wants the package but I can not allow it bc the surprise was so important to me i absolutely had to have my money back so that this place would know and preferably remember that they ruined something for two special people! I wouldn't dare ask for something free, I would feel bad for taking anything not earned, but as a man that runs  a business, I make free offers every day to ensure customer satisfaction and that they come back!!

I moved to the Birmingham area 2 years ago from FL and didn't know where to turn for a good MT, so I took a chance on a couple of Groupons.  I'm always sketchy about these, and the first couple didn't do a very good job, but man am I ever glad I found CR2!!  I cannot even begin to say enough wonderful things about Constance!!  She truly cares about helping people.  Contrary to most people with Fibro, anything less than a really deep tissue massage is just useless to me.  Constance makes sure to go deep enough to be effective, but always checks to make sure its not too much.  She makes sure that all of my hot spots are tended to & I always leave there feeling like a new person.  Recently I had issues with jaw/mouth pain after oral surgery.  My dentist, endodontist & an oral surgeon could not figure out how to fix my pain & just kept throwing more medications at the issue.  This went on for MONTHS.  I finally decided to see if Constance could help.  She researched the issues & I had immediate relief with one visit!  Talk about a miracle worker!  She's so good that every time my son comes for a visit I schedule time for him to see her.  He works hard & has back issues as well.  I'm beginning to think that his trips are as much to see Constance as they are to see me!  =)\nBottom line, without any hesitation, I would absolutely recommend Constance & CR2!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1482710152297, "text": "Thank you so much Mary.

However, as a Licensed Esthetics Instructor that researched extensively the salt cave benefits prior to constructing our specially designed Salt Cave. I would like to share facts regarding the salt cave with you.\n\u2022\tTaking wellness to another level, halotherapy (a.k.a. Salt Therapy) is similar to spending time in the salty sea air, which offers many more benefits than \u201csleeping\u201d on the beach.\n\u2022\tAncient Healers and Philosophers recommended salt inhalation for the respiratory system and health problems. Dry salt therapy originates from speleotherapy (cave therapy). This was discovered in Poland where workers exhibited fewer respiratory illnesses.   There are thousands of salt rooms in Europe and beyond.\n\u2022\tThe benefits of Salt Therapy are wide-ranging.  Salt levels affect our cell activity, energy, and blood sugar levels.  A natural disinfectant, salt is antimicrobial, and antibacterial.  Salt comes in empty processed forms or healthier pure sea salts that contain 84 elements and trace elements found in the human body.  Dry salt air is more powerful than moist air.\n\u2022\tNegatively charged ions in salt improve our health and mood.  Inhaling particles may reduce inflammation and mucus in the lungs, improving respiratory conditions such as asthma, allergies, bronchitis, sinus congestion, and C.O.P.D.   We have seen physical proof of many of these conditions improving through our loyal clients.\n\u2022\tThe calming and detoxifying effects of halotherapy can support the immune, nervous and lymphatic systems.   Additional benefits are reduced stress and headaches, increased energy and better sleep patterns.  Salt ions purify the air and may increase lung capacity and reduce physical ailments for adults, children and athletes.  A series of treatments are recommended to keep the body healthy during flu or allergy season.    So, this is why we offer packages to continue your treatments.\n\u2022\tA session will last 45 minutes. For mild to moderate respiratory conditions, 10 to 12 sessions are recommended, depending on individual results. For best results, sessions should be 4 to 5 times per week.   Since everyone responds differently to therapy, this is provided as an average upon which to gauge your personal experience.   After the initial set of treatments, you should follow up at least once per week.\n\nThe Salt Cave temperature was accurate and is temp and humidity controlled by its individual unit. Blankets were provided in the salt cave for your comfort in the temp controlled room.   To be freezing in there, it was your decision not to use the provided amenities.\n\nWhile your wife enjoyed her massage that was paid for via gift certificate, you chose to participate in a service as well.    Our company policy states that Gift Certificates are only used for the person that they were purchased for.  Therefore, your salt session could not be added to her gift certificate.   The remainder of her certificate will be for her to relax and enjoy other services.\n\nWe have been in business over 25 years, and our reputation speaks for itself. Our moto has always been \u201cWhere You Come To Get Away\u201d.  We strive to maintain an environment and technology free zone that offers an opportunity for our clients to get away from the stresses of everyday life. It is your opinion that you found this \u201cboring\u201d. Following your treatment yesterday, you enjoyed our front porch swing, while on your cell phone. You expressed to me, that you understood the concept of the salt, because while you were living in Florida you \u201cspent many nights sleeping on the beach\u201d.\n\nIn response to your review, We pray that you will take this reply positively and learn the facts of the salt cave and our business rather than negatively portraying our business.\n\nGod Bless,\nPenny Ogle,\nLicensed Esthetics Instructor\nOwner"}, "gmap_id": "0x8861d93395331f91:0x4ea606343bb0ccd4"}

We did our research and saw it had a 4.7 star rating so we decided to check it out. Upon entering they were very friendly and the building was very nice and clean. I just needed a fill in for my pink and white and my friend needed a whole new set. Things were great at first but the lady upset my friend a little when she told her she wanted short stiletto nails and she said no they are long I can show you and my friend said I understand but I have had them that short before and she said there going to be ugly that short and so my friend was like ok can you just do square then because she felt as if the lady was trying her best to discourage what she as the customer wanted done. The lady moves to my seat to work on my pink and white fill in and I have been to several salons enough to know how I want them done and how I expect them to be done so instead of starting with shaping the pink power first then working to the white so the white powder could have a rounded shape like I want instead of a straight across shape I started to get a little upset and my friend spoke up for me and said I\u2019m sorry but I thought normally you use the silver tool to shape in the round form of the white and the lady said you can do it that way but we do it this way so finally I got the courage to speak up and point out that the nails she had done looked nothing like that he nails I already had and I wanted them like I had my originals and I didn\u2019t scream or yell at her my voice got a little high tense because at this point I was getting very stressed out and she just stood up and said you need to just leave your to picky I will just charge you a small fee so it will be cheaper and her husband was working on my friends nails and he said yeah that\u2019s best you made her feel bad and I think you need to leave and I was like what I already asked her if she could just quit and paint them a color so your going to charge me for something that\u2019s half done and not even finish the job and he said yes you need to just leave so my friend was my ride and she obviously wasn\u2019t going to make me wait while she finished hers so she told him that she would have to leave also because she was my ride and he said ok that\u2019s fine y\u2019all can both go and don\u2019t worry about paying just don\u2019t ever come back because y\u2019all are obviously to picky for us. WE HAVE NEVER been treated this way before we always leave a nice tip and never been told we were too picky but when you are PAYING for a service you get what you asked for and you let them know what you want. Needless to say they don\u2019t have to worry about us coming back anyways so we went to PERFECT NAILS on south parkway and when we went in we told them a short story about how we were made to leave a nail salon for being to picky and they wouldn\u2019t finish our nails and as soon as we sat down the most awesome girl ever Linda sat down and was like ok let me see and soon as she saw them she said \u201comg what happened to your nails\u201d she had to totally reshape them because the lady at revive had them all different lengths and shapes. I encourage anyone thinking about coming to this place BEWARE THEY DO NOT LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE TO PICKY ABOUT THE SERVICE THEY ARE PAYING FOR.

If I were to attempt to do this, I might end up with a thesis.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing the chiropractor, Dr. Brown, here for a few months. Originally, I sought out chiropractor help for a foot disorder which surgeons recommended surgery for, but it\u2019s a brutal surgery. I already tried surgery once for this issue and it came back 10 years later.\n\nWhile seeking surgical advice this time around, I told the surgeons I felt like my back and hips couldn\u2019t take the recovery from the Achilles\u2019 Tendon surgery because Ow! They did MRIs and found 4 compressed discs, 3 compressed nerves in my back.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 months and no surgery so far! He\u2019s willing to try different things and learn more about treating all of the conditions in each visit. I just got home from my 14th trip. When I went in, it had been over a week and Ow! I walked out of there 45 minutes later feeling a lot younger than 46. Key word in that sentence is \u201cwalked.\u201d Now that I\u2019ve been home a while, I could skip! I will sleep well tonight!\n\nI\u2019m in Decatur and dislike driving, but travel to this office is worth it and I look forward to the visits so much that I even enjoy the drive.\n\nThe staff treats everyone like friends and the place is full of healing energy and good vibes. The doctor is easy to talk with and explains everything perfectly. Medical experiences ~ not many are good. Every time I\u2019ve been to this office, it IS a good experience.\n\nThank you, Dr. Brown and staff, for everything you do to help!

Well we move to Huntsville in August 2018 and it had been about 5 months since my last visit to a chiropractor.  I noticed one morning that my right arm had numbness and tingling.  This exacerbated to my fingertips over a period of a week.  I went into Fox medical on base; of course, they gave me pain medication and sent me on my way with a referral to pain management.  I made an appointment with Millar Chiropractic because I knew there was something wrong with my spine.  By this time, (around Thanksgiving 2018), I was in excruciating pain and on the verge of wanting my arm amputated to just get rid of the pain.  Dr. Justin sat down with me and listened to my story with great patience and intrigue.  He recommended an MRI, which I got done a few days later at Crestwood Imaging & Diagnostic Center.  Come to find out my cervical disc\u2019s were both compressed and herniated causing the pain and discomfort.  My entire career it was my lower back that had issues, never my neck.  Dr. Justin immediately got me into therapy consisting of cervical decompression, cold laser, and TENS, along with spinal adjustments.  TRICARE does not cover chiropractic care, so working with his AWESOME Staff, they were able to set up a financial plan that fit my budget.  It\u2019s Feb 2019 and I am back at 100%, if not better!  If it were not for Dr. Justin and his amazing staff, I would probably be on heavy narcotics only masking the pain and creating a worse situation for my spinal cord.  I would like everyone to come in for at least one visit and see what he can do or help out with in your spinal health.

I was seeing a neurologist tying to get my migraine headaches under control and seeking relief for my back. Of course the first thing he ordered was physical therapy which only complicated the problem. Next step was medication which only turned me into a zombie. Next step I was recommended to a surgeon for consultation. The doctor  walked in the exam room without speaking, looked at my films and simply said nothing here I can help you with and stared to walk out. I stopped him and ask what I was supposed to do? He shrugged his shoulders and left. At this point I was   tears.  My primary doctor sent me to another surgeon. Another extensive schedule of physical therapy. This was before we moved here to Athens last year. I was desperate for relief.  I was looking for doctors on line and came across Millar Chiropractic. I thought after a neurologist, injections, two surgeons and extensive physical therapy it was time to try this approach.  I know this is a lengthy post but I felt I had to go through this first to give a reason for for my sincere recommendation. I made an appointment and so thankful I did. At the end of my consultation Dr. Walbom sent me for ex rays. A plan was made for treatment. The a office staff couldn't be more friendly, they make you feel welcome when you walk through the door. The people that set you up for treatment are always checking on you to make sure you are comfortable and relaxed. I am into my sixth treatment and have already experienced relief. Dr. Walbom talks with me after each session and I couldn't be more confident that I will come out of this office feeling like a new person. I can't say enough good words to encourage you to know this office staff and Dr.  Walbom  will actually listen to you and they care about your pain.

He was very patient with the process and tried everything within his power to help me avoid foot surgery. Unfortunately, my injury was a torn tendon that warranted surgical repair but through my recovery, Dr. Klein was there giving me tips, keeping the rest of my body as comfortable as possible through a prolonged period of casts and nonweightbearing requirements, and being incredibly supportive every step of the way.\n\nAfter a short time of visiting him, my lower back pain was resolved as well. I work a stressful job where I stand long hours and wear heavy safety equipment, but he keeps my lower back in check.\n\nI am so happy that I stumbled upon this chiropractic office over a year ago. Amanda and Dr. Drew make an amazing team and create a welcoming and professional environment. They're also incredibly personal and make it a point to know each of their clients. Speaking of which, when I walk into their office, I don't feel like a client, I feel like a member of a family. I think what I appreciate most is that they aren't here to waste your time. If he doesn't think there is anything he can do to help you, he will let you know. I always appreciate their honesty and their compassion for their patients. It's no surprise they were voted #1.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481747310114, "text": "Thank you, Emily!

He genuinely cares and is glad to share and help.\n\nAs I expected, I saw Dr. Klein two, sometimes three times a week in the beginning. My neck pain was severe and was radiating down my arm. I wanted to avoid surgery at all costs. Within two weeks, the pain was gone but due to my desk job, I was prone to drift back out of alignment. Dr. Klein treated my neck and back pain but also took the time to advise me on the most ergonomic set-up for my job to prevent neck and back pain in the future. As I progressed, my visits were spaced farther apart. As things stand now, I am feeling great and plan to maintain regular maintenance visits to stay on this path. If only I'd found him 7 years ago!\n\nOn the wellness side, I have a few medical issues and Dr. Klein has been a tremendous help to me in understanding what the issues mean, what my body may be trying to tell me and what I can do to combat the issue. I've also relied on him for referral advice on physicians because I value his opinion and trust his judgment.\n\nLakeCrest Chiropractic is certainly a place you can expect quality care and not fear being placed through a series of expensive tests just for the sake of making money. Dr. Klein has proven to me time and time again that he is in this business to HELP people. I highly recommend LakeCrest Chiropractic.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481747555965, "text": "Thank you, DeAnna!

We are a small family business who strives to treat our patients like family, with the upmost care and respect. We have seen amazing results through chiropractic for many of our patients, but it is very true that if we feel something else might benefit them to achieve their healthcare goals (like orthotic inserts, physical therapy, or referring to a medical specialist), we will encourage our patients to seek those treatment options. We wholeheartedly believe in chiropractic care, but we also believe that it isn't the answer for every case that comes in our office---which is why we often recommend orthotic inserts, etc. We do not sell nor are we affiliated with any sort of orthotic insert, we have just seen so many patients respond really well (especially folks whom are quite active or on their feet all day) to shoe inserts which is why we will often recommend folks to try them out \u2014 so sorry if we ever came off as pushy, it was never our intention.

Was told that my pelvis was tilted one way on one side and a different way on the other, subluxations were present in several places, and my kneecaps were not in the proper place. Realizing this treatment plan was going to be a sizeable investment both in time and money I decided to seek out a second opinion. (Honestly, felt kind of like I was at a cattle call with the first guy.) This is how I met Dr. Drew. His diagnosis jived with the first one, but his approach was so much better! First of all, he did not want to do duplicate XRays. He tried to save me money and exposure to radiation by having by having me pick up my first set of XRays from the other place. Secondly, he was quick to say that he did not work miracles but did believe he could help me. His estimation of treatments required was fewer than the other guy, but we were still in for months of multiple treatments per week. I gladly started treatment immediately.\n\nAfter about 3 weeks Dr. Drew advised that I was not getting the kind of relief he expected and ordered an MRI. Kind of freaked me out and I tried bargaining with him explaining that I had actually not been resting and icing like he recommended. He was supremely patient and convinced me to have the MRI. The test showed that I had a congenital condition called Diastematomyelia which had never been diagnosed. My spinal cord was split and tethered. Apparently the condition is rare and we began a frantic search for a neurosurgeon who had actually performed the surgery before. Dr. Drew was with me every step, answering questions, sending referrals, and calming my nerves. This condition left untreated could eventually have caused more loss of strength and coordination, incontinence, and paralysis.\n\nToday I am 3 weeks post op. 2 surgeons operated on me for 8 hours. All signs as of now indicate that the surgery was a complete success. Dr. Drew, through his unwavering commitment to patient care, got this journey started and I owe him a debt of gratitude. The only argument that I have with him is that I believe he is a miracle worker in getting this condition diagnosed.\n\nbtw - Mel is awesome and keeps the office running like a well oiled machine!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481747609736, "text": "Thank you, Ms. Rhonda!
