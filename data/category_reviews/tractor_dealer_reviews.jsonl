I brought the car back in on Monday the 4th and told them the service engine light came on and something under the car was rattling. I was told by the owners son that he didnt know anything about standard shift cars and they would not be responsible for anything wrong with it. Almost 3 weeks later the car starts running hot. When my husband got to me to check it out he opened up the radiator to find that it is full of J.B block seal he runs over 80 gallons of water through the radiator trying to clean it out to no avail. We replaced the thermostat that was so coroded with block seal it was rusted up. I called and left a message with Pierce auto sales telling them that the car was running hot and because someone was trying to cover up a cracked block or blown head gasket and there was so much block seal in the radiator and engine that I didn't know if the car was going to make it home and that I really needed someone to call me back because I had no way to get it home. I never recieved a call back.It cost me $60 to rent a car dolly to drag it home. Now the car came with an outside warranty but because \"whoever\" filled the motor up with block seal to hide a major problem until they could find an idiot \"me\" to take the car off of there hands the warranty will not cover the car. So now I have a blown up car sitting in my yard that I drove less then a month and repo men knocking on my door because they want there car back and still after all this time I have yet to recieve a call from anyone at Pierce Auto Sales.  I recieved more help and sympathy from the repo man in 10 minutes then I have from Pierce in 2 months. I paid $1500 down for a car that didn't even last until the first payment was due. I dont bash people or businesses but i have tried every other way to get them to talk to me. I just want my money back so I can get a car that runs and won't leave me on the side of the road less then a month after purchase.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a56497104639d:0x842e60c3c94517bb"}

I drove an hr to pick up machine got in it and had the same issue as when I dropped it off .\nNever got it on the trailer !!!\nI left machine with them for yet another wrong diagnosis of bad hydraulic pump !\nI got contacted that machine was ready so I picked it up . Still same issues but I needed it to continue with work . They had my machine for almost 2 weeks which is not a problem if I get back a fixed machine.\nThe repair cost was almost $4000 and machine was still the same as the day I took it .\nSo after a few weeks of trying the machine it never got better or worse so I knew I still had an issue !\nI took it to a repair shop that I was referred to and after 3 hrs I got a call your machine is ready !!!\nExciting news and it was only a issue with computer it was stuck in a precision mode !!\nCost me $164 and the machine works great !!!\nI called TRIGREEN and told them and they did absolutely nothing but tell me it needed the parts they installed! Remember the statement I referred to earlier ^ the next section tells you the answer !!\n\nNow here is the kicker precision mode decreases hydraulic flow which was my issue and is exactly what TRIGREEN said but failed to check the obvious because they want to throw parts at your problem and run your bill up ! The parts they replaced was not necessary because it was just stuck in the wrong mode .\nI have called corporate and they are sticking with the decision of the Florence store on not making this right .\nI\u2019m writing this to warn you off of using this company they are not customer service friendly and incompetent of working on the product they sale .\nHope this helps the next customer with there decision on buying or using this store for anything!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601396965606, "text": "Hi Scott -- we are certainly very sorry to hear that your experience with TriGreen has left you feeling angry and frustrated.

I could have gotten a MUCH better deal from another dealer but I didn't want to drive over an hour if I needed parts. For this reason I was willing to overlook the salesman who had ZERO knowledge of tractors, had no idea what a flail mower was and couldn't tell me what features would justify the expense of one implement over the other. I was willing to ignore  the random mechanic who wandered onto the sales floor trying to talk me out of the machine I wanted even though he had no understanding of my needs. I also endured the pain of dealing with the rude and unwelcoming finance manager who had the personality of a shoe. All of this because of the promise of a good service department and the full coverage warranty through Kubota and KTAC which is supposed to cover EVERYTHING on the tractor. Fast forward a few months and it's time for a small part that broke. I went right to HMTC service dept only to find out that not only is the part not covered, but they don't even have the part in stock and will take a month to come in. Ok, chalk it up to bad luck. Another month or so later I head to HMTC again for simple parts and they have none in stock. This happened a total of 4 times and I finally give up. The management here is out of touch with the market and their customers. They refuse to hire competent, qualified employees. Even the lady and the front door acts like you're interrupting her day when you walk through the door. Never again will I do business with or recommend anyone to HMTC. I honestly hope they get bought out soon by someone who knows how to run a business and serve their customers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a02c7803e7839:0xead23cabc77376df"}

I asked them why and they said \"Knowledge about your purchase will make you a better owner, and you will take better care of it because you now have skin in the game or so they say.\"\nIf you want the full  old timey correct customer experience, Fredricks is your place.

That is why when I purchased my tractor last year I did research for several months before purchasing my Massey Ferguson.  I looked at their longevity, handling, safety, reliability, company name, ability to get parts and the service department in case I was not able to repair the problem.  After checking Foothills, Banisters, Ag-Pro and Snead,  I finally settled on Haney tractor and equipment, Athens, Alabama.  I  drove 2 hours in each direction just to test drive my model and put a down payment. After, my model came in with my 20 foot trailer & 3 implements, I again, drove back to Athens, Alabama to complete the transaction and bring my new package home.  I was very disappointed with Foothills.  Even though I an less than 10 miles away, the purchase did not seem right (comfortable).\nToday, a year later, the same still holds true.  I decided to give Foothills another chance at my business. I am looking to purchase a rotary cutter.  Of course I checked prices on the internet in my area.  Everything from $1,000, $1,100, $1,200 for the 1204 Titan 2021 year model.  When I called,  the salesman would not identify himself.  I had to ask him his name, Daniel, and I introduced, myself.   I informed him what I was looking to purchase and was informed that he had new ones.  After checking his price in his book he told me the price was $1,400 plus tax.  I informed him that, that was a little costly, since others had the item listed at a different price.  He told me to go buy it from them.  Seeing that we were not going to make a sale, we both hung up.  I try to give as much business as possible to local and small business.  People do not always agree, however, there is no need to be disrespectfully.  I do not need a response or reply.

I assure you this is not the level of service we strive to provide here at Foothills Tractor and will take considerable measures to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nIn Foothills defense, all of our old prices implements were restored long ago, with increase in supply demand we have seen as much as a 15% increase in materials and steel. This leading to higher priced units. We could have sold you a 4\u2019 cutter in January for $1000, unfortunately we cannot do that currently as we would be selling for less than our cost and losing money. We cannot afford to stay in business by losing revenue.\n\nAs the General Manager, David Seals, I would love to speak to you directly and see if we can provide you a 5-star level of service from now forward.

Michael simply said, \"we'll take care of it.\"  And boy did they!  Michael's team went through our trailer like they were prepping for a military-style white glove inspection.

A week and a couple follow-up calls later, they still don't know what is wrong with my mower.  A couple days later, I'm told it's the auto choke in the carb although there is a choke on the handle.  A few days later, they are still waiting on the Honda parts rep to call them back.  Next day, I'm promised an estimate; I hear nothing.  I call the next business day (Monday) when I'm told i will have an estimate by the end of the day, but I told them if I didn't hear back that afternoon (2+ weeks later), I was picking my mower and not paying the diagnostic fee.  Do you think I got a call?  Nope.  At least they're consistent. I picked up the broken mower the next day without paying.  I would avoid this place, for service, like the plague.\n\nAlso of note, they do not use computers to document your equipment's problem, part number, or your contact info; they use a small notebook.  While I'll appreciate simplicity, I expect a business to be organized--not this service department!\n\nIf I could give zero stars or even negative, since my mower carburetor gasket was ripped during diagnostics, I would.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e824ab6ad50c9:0xfd65132a4056919f"}

Prior to this I physically visited SunSouth to purchase a mower but was told that I would need to go to a place like Lowes or Home Depot. I used my mower 3 times and noticed that the engine was leaking oil. On 29 Sep (when I noticed the leak), I called Lowes since I also purchased an extended warranty. They said that they would have someone come out to pick it up and that they would call the day before they were supposed to pick it up (scheduled for today 4 Oct) and give me a time. They were also supposed to call the day of pick up to let me know they were on the way.\n\nStill haven't received a phone call and it it currently 4:21 pm. They close at 5 pm. My wife called Lowes back today at about 3:40 pm and they said they would contact them again and if we didn't hear from them that Lowes would call someone else.\n\nNeedless to say, I am NOT happy at all. I don't know about all of the other experiences, but so far mine is terrible. I will update if I get a call. Hopefully they can redeem themselves and get more than one star.
