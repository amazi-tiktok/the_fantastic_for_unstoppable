My husband got a peach pic and I got a pinecone. 2 staff members one with shorter hair one with longer. They checked us out and we went outside with our box. We saw that they gave us one sprinkle donut but charged us for 2. Then I found a hair in my pinecone. I went back and they had already put away the donuts. However I quietly showed the lady with short hair. That there is a hair in my breakfast. Her reply was\" well these things happen\" no they do not just happen someone is not careful enough while baking and cooking. She replaced my breakfast however by that time I was done. it would have been a great place if they paid attention to their work and not rush to pack up for the day.

The service has always been great and we rarely, if ever, have any complaints. So we know what their typical level of service is. We were beyond psyched to see they were opening up a new location on Acton Rd, which is now closer to my mom's house. We have been to the Acton location many times over the past year and a half, thinking we'd have a similar experience to the Valleydale location. I'm so disappointed to say that EVERY single time I've gone, as well as all other family members, we've had a horrible experience! Overall, the customer service is terrible. The employees do not listen or don't pay attention to what you want or what you actually get. For example, this morning we went thru the drive thru. There was no one in line and no one in the store. We ordered 2 dozen glazed holes and 6 regular glazed. Easy enough, right?! We thought so.. But apparently not. We got the holes but when we got home and opened up the box, I couldn't believe it! Not one single regular glazed donut was in the box!! There was a chocolate covered, chocolate with sprinkles, a custard filled chocolate covered donut, sour cream, strawberry sour cream and blueberry cake donut! It seemed like we got someone else's order but no one else was there! When I tried to call the store, their answering machine picked up after several rings, so I left a message. After receiving such poor service, I can't even immediately speak to anyone about it!! It is impossible to understand how these 2 locations share the same name. That's the only thing they have in common. I\nWe've also been incorrectly and outrageously charged during another trip. They charged us over $30 when the correct total was no more than $15. This wasn't the first time we've been given the wrong items. My sister and mom went during a slow time. No other customers were there in the drive thru or inside. They ordered a dozen assorted donuts and 2 large coffees. The girl ended up handed them 2 big boxes of donuts and a large and medium coffee. Then proceeded to charge them a price that was way more than what they had ordered. My sister told the girl they hadn't received the right order and gave the boxes back. After a while of waiting, they were given another box of donuts. However, they were still being charged the same price as before for the 2 dozen donuts, even though they'd given 1 box back, that they never even ordered to begin with. My sister had to explain to her that they'd given the second dozen back and that they only ordered one dozen. Eventually she corrected the total. But after all that, they didn't even bother addressing the wrong coffee size they received. When they got home, of course the order wasn't right. They had 2 chances to correct the order and still failed. That's ridiculous! We have not had a single good trip to this location. Most visits have been during extremely slow times when no other customers were at Daylight. It doesn't make sense how it's consistently so awful when they're only taking care of 1 customer.\nIn addition, the donuts we have had there do not taste nearly as good as what we've had at the other location. That is not just my opinion. Several other family members have said the same.\nWe've given this location more than enough attempts to get better so we do not intend to return, except to get our money back for our wrong order today. We'll stick to the Valleydale Daylight and I recommend the same to others!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517369291149, "text": "Hope, we are so sorry for the experiences you have had at our Acton Rd location.

The town of Geraldine is slow, and often only acts as a destination that people pass through on their daily routine. Frothy Dog, though, makes it so that the town of Geraldine is worth stopping IN for a visit.\n\nNortheast Alabama, as a region, is hungry for proper specialty coffee, and only Frothy Dog has stepped up to the plate to truly satiate that hunger. It does a lot of things rights. Their blended drinks are popular, their Chicken Salad Sandwich is a cut above, but their espresso based coffee? That's the magic of the shop. That's where this shop excels. It takes great care in tuning, and extracting the best cup of coffee, and the owners are very knowledgeable about the craft and art of coffee. There's no other coffee shop like it in the area.\n\nIf you're a resident in DeKalb County, or in Geraldine itself, and haven't tried Frothy Dog out yet, do yourself a favor, and make that trip. The owners do a great job of walking newcomers to coffee through their first cup. Sometimes it's a full jump for those who are ready to enjoy the world of espresso, and sometimes you're eased in with a sweet, blended beverage. No matter what, you will not disappointed with your drink.\n\nAnyone new to coffee will love their dark Mocha, and the Coconut Dark Mocha are also great drinks. I love both as an avid coffee drinker as well. I recommended for the regular coffee drinker, their 12oz regular latte with an extra shot of espresso, or just a two shots of espresso by itself and a cup of ice water if you're feeling adventurous. Amazing espresso, quality shop.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600309993622, "text": "Thank you Brian for the super awesome review! You may need to pursue a career in journalism.

Perfect temp and the mix is exactly how the macchiato should be. I tried the lunch: SouthWest Panini and chips. Came with an apple slice and Cheetos. Great sandwich! I would have preferred a pickle instead of the apple. The hot sandwich gave the apple a bit of a taste.  I would have preferred a choice of chips but all in all good little lunch. Maybe there is a way to choose but I didn\u2019t see it on the QuickCup app. Green tea frappe was nice. Very refreshing. The cup is a little flimsy and definitely easy to pop the top or drop with a heavier frappe. Especially handing it out the drive thru. I think the QuickCup service could be better. I ordered early but had to wait on my sandwich to be made after arriving but the sandwich definitely was worth the wait. My drinks were ready when I arrived.  I\u2019m glad Geraldine has a little spot for the coffee lovers in town. I definitely think the employees are friendly and the place wil be very popular for the younger crowd in town.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1535231771644, "text": "Thank you for the great review.

I tried to order the same drink I LITERALLY ordered on Friday and she lied about them not making it anymore. I mentioned that I had just ordered it on Friday. She got snippy and made it but it wasn't correct. I told her(which took a lot for me) that it wasn't supposed to be warm. She rudely said \"you didn't say ice. I never have said iced and have always gotten it the way I like it. Then she makes another one and I tell her how it's supposed to be BUT NOPE! Still wrong.

While I was still waiting a couple that had ordered after us both got their meals and mine had yet to come. Finally after maybe 25 minutes mine finally arrived. it was 2 tiny toasted tortillas a few slices of tomato and a little cup of goat cheese and 2 pieces of bacon.

I visited Dreamcakes Cafe with my mother and sister for afternoon tea. It was such a special day for us because we planned afternoon tea right before they accompanied me to shop for my wedding dress! The staff knew this and were so excited, kind, and encouraging.\n\nWe made our tea selections a few days before our event via email. Kallie was wonderful about responding on email. We had to sign a contract prior to the tea and she made it very easy to do so. When we arrived to the cafe, our tea table was set up with everything we needed: teacups, utensils, saucers, even fresh flowers! The set up was stunning and the food was delicious! I highly recommend the pimento cheese sandwich with peach jam and the macarons!!\n\nDuring the tea, the wait staff made us feel so special. Someone was always by to ensure we had everything we needed, refill cups, etc and all of them were SO polite, friendly, and knowledgable about tea selections. My sister had a gluten and dairy allergy and they made sure she knew what she could and couldn't eat and even brought out a special cup of chicken salad for her.\n\nThank you Dreamcakes staff! You made this such a special day for us. The thought and time you put into the details of our tea was noticed and SO appreciated. It was perfect from start to finish. Hope to see yall again soon... we will be back!!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONY-oJn9BWzuTdb2Fi3h6atL79YWPl-U63vkJQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPHHd3s1HgC_MYEB8GlhgLV96Lk0wjV05Aiz7P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1626716965329, "text": "Thank you so much Erin!

In addition to having just about anything you might find yourself needing while out on a stroll around downtown, or serving jury duty, etc., the staff is incredibly friendly and will (in my experience) go out of their way to ensure your good day.\nHowever, you will be paying convenience store prices for most of their selections: a cup of coffee will only leave you a little better off than a visit to Starbucks (without the carefully constructed flavor--ACoE's coffee has been particularly bitter in my experience, even with sugar and cream), and the food can get a little pricey as well. Packaged foods, on the other hand, seem to be a bit cheaper than, say, the store inside the courthouse but it's not really enough to keep me from driving the little extra distance to the Publix at Twickenham Square.\nThe cozy atmosphere and neat meeting space upstairs, though, may be enough to counter-balance the slightly higher prices and not-so-awesome coffee--and a warm Spring day sat outside with a cold cup of iced tea and a fresh-made sandwich can't quite be beat.\nSo all-in-all, if you don't mind spending a bit more and not getting Starbucks-quality coffee, you will get a cozy, unique atmosphere great for a refreshing time on your own or with friends.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b56a1fd3df7:0xd805f6cc220b76af"}

Washing hands before TAKING the order just creates the need to wash them again. We wash hands 100% of the time before making ANY beverages. ALWAYS HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL. But yeah, that's gross, and probably embarrassing to the guy attempting to take your order. Downright deplorable. You know that feeling right?  We've all been there and it ALWAYS happens at the worst possible time.  What matters though, really, is the recovery. I hate that you had to leave so abruptly though, as you missed the part where he washed his hands before preparing the drink you ordered. It was good too. I know because I drank it.

So I walk up to the counter to ask for a refund and got a lot of attitude from the manager directly whom I hadn't even spoke to yet and a response of no refunds.

Hot chocolate-- First off, let me say, they used milk in the hot chocolate. This may seem like a small detail, but a disturbing number of coffee shops use water in their hot chocolate and that is not okay. Not Santos. Santos put milk in the hot chocolate like they care. I appreciate that. 10/10. Would order again.\n2. Cold brew--The cold brew was good and would be great if you are a fast drinker, but it came in one of those clear cups that have no insulation, so if you are like me and leisurely sipping for an hour or so, the ice will melt and the cup will sweat. Not my favorite. 4/10.\n3. Cafe Nutella--yaaaaasssss. This was by far my favorite. I absolutely loved it.

(Staff looked at me like I was crazy when I told them about the bathrooms.)  Trash cans were covered in spilt drinks, gravy, salt, etc. One young man walked out looked in trash can, turned and got right back on his phone.  Food was soso. Feel sorry for people going through drive thru.  If only they could see how filthy this place really is!!!  Will NOT be going back!!!!  I am not a person of money but I do expect where I eat to be clean! PS. Shae was very sweet.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889186cd300f08b:0x95223f65276e0be2"}

My wife was on the phone and said choose something, so I chose a French vanilla latte for her. She later told me she's not usually a big fan of  French Vanilla lattes but she really liked hers because it still tasted like coffee.

If the owners would just take 10 minutes to read their most recent Google reviews, they could make the desperately needed changes that the night crew currently are so terribly in need of immediately.  I assume, however, their apparent lack of concern all around with how poorly run this site has been doing business must mean that they're not concerned about their profits. And that's really sad because that translates to customers that upper management doesn't care about us and our concerns.\n\nThere are 2 things I know to be 100% CONSISTENT and TRUE about this McDonald's:\n\n1. That for any given hours between midnight and 4:00AM you'll be turned away by the staff because their \"system is down again\".  More than likely, it'll be told to you  over the drive thru speaker in a short/abrubt/rude manner and/or tone.\n\n2.  That, should you win the lottery during those late night night hours and actually make it past the drive thru speaker's gatekeeper, and give them your order...when you arrive at the window to pay & receive your anticipated meal, there is a 75% chance the staff will say anything to you, beyond the amount you're due to pay them, (because they're so deeply preoccupied in their own interpersonal conversations behind the coumter), and there is a 100% chance that you will NEVER be sent off with a \"THANK YOU!!\".  Never. And that includes the day shift employees,  in addition to the overnight crew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922b3b87ed2c5:0xf44cc350de2e8677"}

To that I get a response of \"OK.\"   When I get to the window the cashier asks what I will have.

She gave me a head bob and said there's no reason to be that way and walked away.  I then was able to place my order with the cashier.  I said to her that at some other fast food establishments the person taking the order gives you their name as you order to ensure better customer service.  She then replied in a snippy was. \"Nope, we don't give you our names here.\"  I said \"I would guess not, or it would make it to easy for customers to complain about poor service.\"   When I pulled forward the girl handing me our food was polite and all smiles.  I complimented her and told the manager behind her that it was nice to have a happy person at that window when the people taking the order were terribly rude.

Today though there was a lady with blue hair, I didn\u2019t get her name down though. She showed excellent customer service to the two girls in front of me but when it came time to take my order specifically she was showing terrible customer service...but passively. Like she didn\u2019t want to take my order but had to since I was already there. She didn\u2019t ask if I wanted my receipt and she didn\u2019t give me a straw and sugar for my coffee either like she did the other two girls in front of me. I had to ask, and when I did she seemed a bit hesitant to give them to me. Like I was taking up her time. I was having kind of a bad day that day and this is why we (especially if you work in customer service) should always strive to at least TRY to treat people with decency...I\u2019m also aware we all have our bad days though and nobodies perfect. You never know what other people are gong though truly. I\u2019m a bit skeptical on coming back here because I don\u2019t wanna have another employee lowkey making me feel bad, especially if I might be having another bad day next time as well.

This McDonalds, on the other hand, deserves the reputation that stigmatizes fast food everywhere. We don't frequent McDonalds anymore because this one is so bad, but the kids beg to go anytime they see the golden arches. Tonight, since we were in a hurry, I swung by the drive-thru for what I thought would be a quick visit. There were only 3 cars in the lane in front of us when we arrived. This McDonalds has 2 lanes, supposedly for greater efficiency, and we thought it would move pretty quickly. It did not. To my surprise, when we approached the menu to order we were promptly greeted. I asked the cashier to hold for a moment while I finalized the kids' orders. When I began our order, I informed the cashier I wanted a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese Meal, large sized with a Diet Coke. Yes a Diet Coke. You can laugh. I find the humor in it also. The cashier rang up the meal as I ordered and no sooner than I had gotten it out of my mouth they rudely replied, \"is that all?\" In case you don't know me, that irritates me to my core. If that was all I wanted, I would have said so. The correct question that should be asked politely is, \"what else can I get for you today?\" We have a decent sized family (4 kids), and my wife is picky, so it can take some time to get everyone's orders placed. I know they have metrics to meet, similar to an average handle time for a call center, but like in the call center business, you give the appropriate amount of time to the customer, while being as efficient as possible, then focus on making the next interaction shorter to compensate. Before I could continue with the rest of the order, I had to correct the cashier because they rang up a medium sized meal. Once \"corrected\" I asked if they got the drink large as well. The cashier replied they did. I informed them the screen says otherwise and in order to correct it, they canceled the order and rang it up again. I continued to place the rest of our order, having to repeat myself multiple times because they could not seem to ring it up correctly and when they did not put \"add lettuce\" on the screen for the McChicken, I had to ask multiple times if they got it. The cashier rudely replied, \"it already comes with lettuce.\" Had they said that in the first place we could have saved some time. We finally got our order placed, repeated, and the total provided and we headed to the window. All the cars in the drive-thru merged together into the service line in what appeared to be the correct order for which we took our turns at the menu, but when we arrived at the payment window they tried to charge us for the wrong order. We paid for our order, then it was off to the service window for pick-up. The first thing they tried to hand me was, you guessed it, a Medium Diet Coke. I informed the attendant it was supposed to be large and they looked at me like I was trying to get something I didn't order (at least that was my perception). They pulled the drink back through the window, looked at the screen of their POS (Point of Sale) system, then exclaimed, \"Oh... I see what they did.\" They can have their look back as well since I definitely paid for a large, but I kept that remark to myself. They gave me the other drinks, then the food, and left me waiting for my Large Diet Coke. While waiting, and after they gave me the drink, I proceeded to check the labels, not the individual sandwiches. After all of the waiting and grief we had to deal with on their side, I just wanted to make sure the labels were at least correct. Then, the original cashier that took my order came and hung halfway out the window to ask me, \"Sir, can you please pull up so we can assist these other customers?\" To which, I promptly replied, \"Sure, just as soon as I make sure I received all of my food.\" I wasn't about to go through all of that again. We had received all of the food, and I drove away with the cashier still staring at me like a buffoon. How rude. That's all I can say.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889049231246b35:0x2e5bb33d98875544"}

I cannot rationalize this decision.\nWas it to prevent customers from buying water and nothing else? Doubtful. Water was not the only thing I ordered; Was it to offset the cost of the water and cup?

If so, the restaurant should find a fix that doesn't lead to honest customers unknowingly paying a ridiculous price for something which is usually free at most places.\nAdditionally, the quality of the food was sub-par. The McChicken was overloaded with mayo, the burger was mediocre, and the cup of Coke tasted abnormal compared to experiences at other McDonald's.\nGiving 2 stars because I at least didn't get sick.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889049231246b35:0x2e5bb33d98875544"}

You can also expect your drink to be handed to you with some of it running down the sides of the cup and this is before you have received your food so you have no napkins to wipe it off with.\n\nFor me, visiting this place is more entertainment than for food needs.  It's comical how poorly operated it is yet also sad to see so much potential going to waste.  I wouldn't go here at all if it were not for the rest of my family liking their food.  In fact, half the time I stop there I get them food and then I go to Chic-fil-a to order mine.  At least there I can get exactly what I order that is not just thrown together and my drink is no running all over the cup.\n\nOne more thing about this place.  Forget ever getting any type of milkshake.  I've lived in this area since before this place was even built and since it opened their ice cream or milkshake machine has always been out of order.\n\nUPDATE: 1/11/2018\nAs usual these people can't get an order right to save their own lives.  I ordered two chicken biscuit combos and guess what was in the bag...just one.  Instead of listening they seemed to have gotten totally distracted by what type of chicken biscuit meal.\n\nI wish my family didn't like this place so I wouldn't have to deal with the nonsense here.  OR  perhaps the owner could take some action to ensure that it is run properly...somehow your competitor right there by you, Chic-fil-a, get's it done right.\n\nUPDATE: 10/2019\nNothing has improved.\n\nOrder still can't be taken or prepared properly.  If you're going in then there won't be any salt, pepper, or napkins available.  No creamer for coffee.  You literally have to ask for everything.  You have to ask a group of people who clearly don't want to be there for everything you need ie; ketchup packs or whatever and believe me they aren't interested in hearing your request.\n\nThe tables and seats are dirty and despite the kiosk, which those are good, you still have to go stand in line to get your cups because they won't bring the drinks with the food.  So, they put in a kiosk to reduce lines then force you back into the line...you can't make this kind of stuff up.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889049231246b35:0x2e5bb33d98875544"}

It's sad that we had to drive way out of the way because our usual McDonald's didn't have any power right along with us because of the storm then have to pay more to receive less than good food.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHhYZpcghkhOx9-1oJ66YyOwhGfQVga5yttUlU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd2c8b51669:0xbb37a217ea6bbf63"}

I get to the window and the operator says \u201cone moment please.\u201d So it thought \u201cthat\u2019s fine, he\u2019s probably gotta take care of a simple task real quick.\u201d I thought wrong.

I came in looking for a 14mm quartz banger and was handed a 18mm glass bowl and was told that \"that would do the trick\" that was my first instance. I cannot control what happened with the broken pipes at the underground smoke shop in the back of the coffee shop when smoke and ash wasn't opened; that wasn't me. If there was an issue it should've been addressed. The \"$200\" piece I offered $20 for that may or may not of been china glass still only sold for $50  so my offer doesn't sound too unreasonable.

If you could be more precise about your interactions, I could address your concerns more specifically. I was around the last few times you were in and I'm confused about what my partner could have done to frazzle you so much. Was it the time he asked for your ID per my new policy? Was it the time you were in and your friend dropped and broke two glass pipes and he didn't charge you for them or even make a big deal about it? Was it the time he wouldn't haggle a $200+ single blow recycler from Boulder down to $20 as if it were pressed China glass? Is that what's \"hard to deal with\"? You know me and you know I'm more than happy to address your concerns but I'd need to know more about your perception of his application of my policies. Stop on in and have a chat with me.\n*Reply to your edit*\nSo, you decided to do this here instead of talking to me? Got it. I didn't realize you had access to all my sales and inventory information.

Also, that was lukewarm at best. There were no crispy straws on this sandwich nor was there cheese.\n\nThe chicken tenders were all very small and fairly soft. I did get four of them, but they were all very small. One was about the size of my thumb, at best. I would say three and a half, to be generous.

The service was horrible. There was only one person taking orders. The line from the counter went all the way to the door. After I finally placed our order, I realized that people weren't receiving the food they ordered. People, both inside the store and in the drive-thru lines were coming back to the counter to get things that they ordered but didn't receive. Some people took their orders, got in the car and left and then had to come back because they didn't get their complete order. We waited more than a half an hour \"after\" I placed our order. At that point, I realized that they'd \"skipped\" our number and questioned the girl at the counter who told me it would be up \"soon.\"  I had only ordered two things a Southwest salad and a plain hamburger. I waited a few more minutes, while several more orders were filled, including one order that they filled twice, but my order still wasn't filled. At that point, I stopped the girl again and asked her for a refund. Just as I asked for my refund, another woman came in from the drive thru and said she'd been waiting outside forever for the rest of her order and she wanted a refund too. The girl looked at me, handed me a hamburger (she didn't even bother to put it in a bag) and said she'd refund my salad. I gave the cold hamburger back and told her I wanted a refund for \"all\" of my order. It took her a minute or two to read the receipt. She couldn't seem to tell the difference between the cash I'd given her and the amount of the bill, but I did eventually get my money back.\n\nMy husband's diabetic and controls his blood sugar level with food.

Also of note when I did observe someone mopping the lobby, the water they were using was STINKING horribly due to dirt saturation.  Staff needs to be trained on proper cleaning etiquette.

The place is pretty easy to get to and is just off the interstate exit.  It's located inside the Love's Travel Stop.  Our visit here was on August 4, 2018.\n\nThe place was pretty busy when we came in, which was not a surprise since it was around the lunchtime hour.  My niece was with us, and she wanted McDonald's, so that's the reason for the lunch stop here.  When you first come inside, the place was pretty nice.  There were some tables in there.  With the rush, there were workers there clearing tables as quickly as possible to keep them available for others to use.  I was still a bit apprehensive after seeing other reviews from here, but alas we were here anyways.\n\nThe wait in line to order was quick though.  Our wait on this visit was about 2 minutes, which wasn't bad considering how busy they were.  I ended up ordering a Quarter Pounder With Cheese meal, with a special order on the burger with no pickles and extra onions.  After a few minutes, the order was ready for all of us.  Almost all of the orders were correct.  The only error was with my burger.  They did no pickles and no onions instead of extra onions.  I went back up and asked for extra onions due to the mistake and they got that for me very quickly.  After that, it was time to eat.  The burger, fries, and drink were actually quite good and hot, which I don't normally expect at a fast food place.  The others in the group said their order was correct and the food was good and hot as well.\n\nOverall, this was an okay McDonald's.  There does need to be some work at quality control to make sure orders come out correctly, but other than that, this visit fit the bill with no major issues.  If I am looking for a McDonald's and am in this area again, I'd still come back given the experience in this visit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4f80a81f68f:0x42157023af6427bf"}

When i walked out there was a man (black) being served his food...you decide, it was literally 2 minutes between me being told we're closed, and them handing another customer food... Just dont go here, if they dont want to serve you, just imagine what theyre doing to the food when thay HAVE to serve you....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4f80a81f68f:0x42157023af6427bf"}

I watched my freshly cooked get pulled out of the grease, not be drained and put in the bag with the rest of my order, witch had been sitting there the entire time. The bag was torn, grease was literally dripping from it and my hash browns basically fell apart. On top of all of that, some of my order was left out. I pulled back around to the window and told the cashier that I had food left out and the hash browns were all broken apart and requested that my order be remade. U was asked if I just wanted a refund instead. When I said \"No\", the manager was called and instead of speaking to me like a valued customer, they basically interrogated me. I was asked, \"Did you not see your food being bagged?\" \"Did you not see the hash browns come up fresh?\" I gave the food back, witch SHOULD NOT be allowed with everything going on in the world, and asked that it be remade.

After about a 5 minute wait they gave me my cheeseburger and didn't give me a fresh order of fries. Didn't matter though because guess what?!? Both of them were cold as cardboard! McDonald's on 6th Avenue in Decatur either needs to hire competent employees and caring managers or they just need to shut the store down.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862869db4a0f6cb:0x6803c69e848fbc76"}

Classy and vintage. Not my cup of tea though. You can be classy, vintage, and well kept. So to me it looks a little let-go.\n\nAtmosphere - 5\nVery homey with good lighting for reading during the day or working on your computer at night when you don\u2019t have the natural lighting coming in.\nNot a great place to meet up with friends, but a place to get stuff done. Soft mellow music in the caf\u00e9 is nice.\n\nPricing - moderately high.\nCoffee is priced well but espresso drinks and fraps are over priced by far. Especially for quality and flavoring.\n\nBarista friendliness - 8\nThey have been nice and accommodating even while there are enough people to keep them busy. The customer experience did not go down when they got busier.\n\nCleanliness - 3\nFrom the front door to the back door, everything just needs a good wiping down, scrubbing, or swifter duster.\nBehind the bar should always be a sanitary place. A lot of coffee shops have the backside of the bar facing customers so they can interact while they work. This also hides a dirty workspace. Here at O\u2019Henrys the barista has their back to the customers while they work, and leaves the cleanliness and appearance vulnerable. Not a bad thing, but to be well executed - that junk HAS TO BE CLEAN. I got tea today and tried a friend\u2019s espresso drink. Kinda glad I did that today.\n\nCoffee flavor - 4\nDrip coffee is good and strong. I am very happy they dose their drip coffee on the heavier side so you can get a good robust flavor for all their drip coffee.\nTea is nice because it is Piper and Leaf Tea but not here to review them. It is good though.\nGlad I didn\u2019t get the espresso as my main beverage. The milk of my friends drink was steamed properly but overall underwhelming in flavor of the espresso.\n\nOverall rating - 6", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197b4da6f34b:0x6b153b0762addf85"}
