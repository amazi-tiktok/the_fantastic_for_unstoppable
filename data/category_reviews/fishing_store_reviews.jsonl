The usual point of sale goodies can be found at every register, but the real goodies are found in the old time store... The fudge is awesome!  Sit down meals and available at the in-store restaurant offering a variety of animal meats.\n\nI was impressed with the knowledge the staff had in their respective departments.

It took 3 strangers and myself to find the working dispenser and get paper towels out of it, it was a team effort.\nThere were far less people in the store than previous years, so I'm not sure what their excuse would be.

And by all means it should have been half that time. There really weren't many people in the store. Crafts that were supposed to start at noon didn't begin till around 12:30 and the craft person was stale and thoroughly uninterested in their job. Before when we had come there was quite a bit of interaction and Mrs. Clause even came over to help.\nIt was a total waste of time coming out here. Their restaurant isn't even open anymore.

They were marked down from $44.99. I went and did about 15 more minutes of shopping and went to check out (at 0925 AM). At check out the item showed up as $44.99 and I said I would take it over to refund for them to research the price further. The associate at the refund desk stated the price was never $17.99 and there was no sign there showing it was ever that price. My wife walked back there and could you imaging the signs mysteriously vanished from the time I picked up the item at the rack to the time I went to check out. I was made to look like a liar and a cheat by the refund associate and Bass Pro. The only thing they had to say was they had mistakenly left the sales signs up from the weekend and I would have been okay with that. Instead I had to listen to the other refund associate say I was in the right and the signs were removed late but she could not make the other associate listen to her. Funny how they want to thank you for your military service one minute and then make you out to be a liar in front of other customers the next. I will no longer be shopping at the Bass Pro Spanish Fort location and I would suggest that all customers take photos of sales prices on the racks for they are to be susceptible removed at a moments notice to prove the customer is wrong and vendor is in the right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e72ad1fc5:0xde568058c6022035"}

It had been a while since I was last in there.  I have never had an issue before but this time I was there to spend some money.  I went up to look at a  rifle scope that I had been looking at online.  I went upstairs and took the long way to get there.  We were greeted properly walking in so didn't see any reason to think anything else.  We walked through the bows, then walked past the rifle racks to the scopes.  The guys working the counter were working with other customers so I looked around, I found the one I wanted to see.  In that process, I found another that I was interested in I looked up to see the status of the salespeople and they were over on the other side talking to each other and what looked to be looking at a phone behind the counter.  I left the counter went to check on kids who were by the aquarium.  We walked around and I decided I was going to get both of the scopes I found.  I went back and both salespeople were talking to one person.  So while I was waiting, I found a third scope I wanted.  The lady they were talking to left and they went back to the other end of the counter and did what they were doing before.  Now I don't like when a salesperson hovers over me, but I have worked in retail enough to at least let a customer know I am there to help.  I couldn't even get that out of them, so we walked away.  They missed a out a $4K sale.  I am not going to beg for them to help me.  They weren't busy.  The way I see it is they were just busy ignoring me.  Walking to the exit, I found a gear bag for a decent price and decided to buy it.  The man at the cash register was awesome.  If the guys at the gun counter were, Bass Pro would have sold me a lot more than a $12.99 bag.  I will go back again.

He went into the tracker boat section, spoke with two elderly gentlemen, he doesnt rememeber his name but the gentleman that let him back in the building after looking at the boats outside didnt say anything to him, just opened the door and walked away. So he approached another gentleman sitting at the desk, asked about one of the boats they had outside and about financing, the gentleman\u2019s response was if you dont have a 700 or better they wont finance you and they wont finance anything under $5000.00. Assuming because of how my husband looked that his score was under a 700. So my husband went inside and started looking at kayaks, he was up there for close to an hour and was not approached one time by a sales associate to see if he needed help, at that point he left the store. So not only did you lose a possible sale on a boat you also lost out on the sale of a kayak.
