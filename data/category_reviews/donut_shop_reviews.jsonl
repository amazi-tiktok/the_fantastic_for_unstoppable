I usually just don't. Even when purchasing donuts (or grabbing free ones for that matter) I always go for plain glaze. I've had other eclectic flavors and styles but they usually don't do anything for me. All that being said to say, I now crave sweets and it's because of these donuts!\n\nCheck my pics to see some of the variety that have. From fruity pebbles, to old fashion, to blueberry cake donuts they are all so tasty... It blows my mind. They can only get better with time too, which is scary but exciting. I'm sure there are flavors that are being fine tuned (the owner told me so) that weren't even out when I went. If and when you go, you MUST... MUST... MUST get the maple bacon donut! It's soooo good!\n\nCoffee provided by O'Henry's is the perfect touch. I prefer the Jamaican Me Crazy blend, but there's a house blend as well. Oh, almost forgot... A couple of great breakfast sandwiches on deck as well (there were samples when I went). Both wrapped in baked donut dough!\n\nLong Review Short...

The service has always been great and we rarely, if ever, have any complaints. So we know what their typical level of service is. We were beyond psyched to see they were opening up a new location on Acton Rd, which is now closer to my mom's house. We have been to the Acton location many times over the past year and a half, thinking we'd have a similar experience to the Valleydale location. I'm so disappointed to say that EVERY single time I've gone, as well as all other family members, we've had a horrible experience! Overall, the customer service is terrible. The employees do not listen or don't pay attention to what you want or what you actually get. For example, this morning we went thru the drive thru. There was no one in line and no one in the store. We ordered 2 dozen glazed holes and 6 regular glazed. Easy enough, right?! We thought so.. But apparently not. We got the holes but when we got home and opened up the box, I couldn't believe it! Not one single regular glazed donut was in the box!! There was a chocolate covered, chocolate with sprinkles, a custard filled chocolate covered donut, sour cream, strawberry sour cream and blueberry cake donut! It seemed like we got someone else's order but no one else was there! When I tried to call the store, their answering machine picked up after several rings, so I left a message. After receiving such poor service, I can't even immediately speak to anyone about it!! It is impossible to understand how these 2 locations share the same name. That's the only thing they have in common. I\nWe've also been incorrectly and outrageously charged during another trip. They charged us over $30 when the correct total was no more than $15. This wasn't the first time we've been given the wrong items. My sister and mom went during a slow time. No other customers were there in the drive thru or inside. They ordered a dozen assorted donuts and 2 large coffees. The girl ended up handed them 2 big boxes of donuts and a large and medium coffee. Then proceeded to charge them a price that was way more than what they had ordered. My sister told the girl they hadn't received the right order and gave the boxes back. After a while of waiting, they were given another box of donuts. However, they were still being charged the same price as before for the 2 dozen donuts, even though they'd given 1 box back, that they never even ordered to begin with. My sister had to explain to her that they'd given the second dozen back and that they only ordered one dozen. Eventually she corrected the total. But after all that, they didn't even bother addressing the wrong coffee size they received. When they got home, of course the order wasn't right. They had 2 chances to correct the order and still failed. That's ridiculous! We have not had a single good trip to this location. Most visits have been during extremely slow times when no other customers were at Daylight. It doesn't make sense how it's consistently so awful when they're only taking care of 1 customer.\nIn addition, the donuts we have had there do not taste nearly as good as what we've had at the other location. That is not just my opinion. Several other family members have said the same.\nWe've given this location more than enough attempts to get better so we do not intend to return, except to get our money back for our wrong order today. We'll stick to the Valleydale Daylight and I recommend the same to others!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517369291149, "text": "Hope, we are so sorry for the experiences you have had at our Acton Rd location.
