With the recent price hikes in meat prices, I felt it had came time to look for a more reasonable option. I can gladly say I am so glad I founds Gary's Custom Retail Meats. I purchased a good selection of meats, and we have not been disappointed. The hamburger meat is awesome, taste like it doesn't even have any fillers, almost like ground steak! Gary and his wife offer a nice clean store, along with an excellent variety of meat options, and at a lower price than most local stores. The trip to Rainsville is well worth the quality and the price savings. I do not think you will be disappointed! 5+\u2b50", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861dfadb0eab381:0x516d90f6e5cebfa"}
