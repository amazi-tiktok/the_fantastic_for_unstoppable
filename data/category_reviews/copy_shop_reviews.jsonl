I have always been treated very well from them so, NO I did not want to change. After a while of thinking about it SEVERAL MONTHS and my Son hammering me with the RJ YOUNG name, I did it. I purchased a machine from RJ YOUNG.\nAt first I was skeptical and to be honest I really didn't want to give it a chance (The Machine), but I did and after several months and barely using the machine I starting coming more around it and using it a little more & more. Then I began to really like it because it really printed so nice and pretty fast. It only took me  8 to 10 months to like it but you have to understand I WAS A XEROX Man and I thought there was NOTHING out there but Xerox. The Xerox machine has ALWAYS  performed outstanding and the SERVICE was the best, I was spoiled from that. However, I found out that there was more out there than XEROX! I found out that RJ YOUNG was REAL and believe me they have made a believer out of me. The Service that I thought would not compare to XEROX, has showed me they are just as good and if not BETTER. I never thought I would say that but it is so true. I can not believe how fast the Service Technicians reply to the service calls. They are always polite, and get me back up and running in a very quickly manner. They have such good personalities and a smile! As for the Ladies at the Home Office, Oh My How can you NOT like them. They are AMAZING. They always tell me they will have my supplies on the way or a Technician asap. IT IS JUST SO HARD TO PUT IN WORDS what RJ Young has done for my business. This is a very caring company and to be honest I am so glad that I have some of their product and that I was introduced to the World outside of XEROX. RICO machines have made my life SO MUCH Better and I am so happy that I have changed. If you are not a part of RJ YOUNG, you are probably missing out on good PEOPLE and Great Machines.\nDavid Santos,\nSantos Printing Co.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615567331024, "text": "Thank you so much for your feedback, David!

Apparently, the online ordering process is only convenient if the item you're ordering is not actually in the store and you need it to be.  Otherwise, you will spend just as much time, if not longer, standing at the online pickup counter trying to pick up the item you searched and already paid for online.  Office Depot scanned my driver license (I had already clarified that I personally would pick up the order, as the online form asks). I was asked twice if I wanted a receipt, once by the computer then by the rep (the receipt already came to my email,  along with the $ withdrawn from my account when I placed the order).  I had to sign the credit card panel.  Honestly, I don't have to do all that when I order $200 worth of groceries online for pickup at Walmart.

Came in to pick up extra  mechanical pencils and note cards while in the area and went to the check out.

The older female notices me as well and has to tell the younger female with her back 4 times to return to her register.  She goes to register, doesn't greet me or ask if I found everything alright.  Instead only asks if I want to sign up for a membership a few times after I decline repeatedly.  She puts my order in the bag and walks off before I can take my card out of the chip reader and back into my wallet.  Didn't even get a thank you for shopping.  Will not return again since staff doesn't want to make their customers feel welcomed or care if they make the sell. Will just order supplies from Amazon in advance, or go to Walmart in a pinch.
