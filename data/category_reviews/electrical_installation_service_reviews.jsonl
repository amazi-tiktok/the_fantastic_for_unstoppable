This story takes place in the relatively small parking lot of the hotel I am staying in.\n\nBefore we get started though, know that I tried to resolve this issue directly with the company. The responses I received from them began with a man named \"Andrew\" responding to my initial email with \"who the heck is this\".\n\nIn the attached pictures you will see what their workers did. Things the company clearly considers acceptable, because their attitude towards the situation was condescending at best.\n\nThing #1: You'll see 3 trailers here. One is a different company, one is Scott's Services (the middle one) and one is unmarked. It's not easy to see how many spots they are taking up, but at least 6.\n\nThe drivers were there, and were aware of the problems they were causing. People were actively driving around the lot trying to find parking spots. You can also see the company name on the truck here.\n\nThere is another truck here that is apparently also theirs. After the front desk agent of the hotel asked them to stop blocking parking spaces, they refused, claiming they were stuck. After the agent left they had a good laugh about it, and then moved into the unmarked truck.\n\nThing #2: This is the other side of the parking lot. Another of their vehicles. A much smaller vehicle. One capable of fitting into a single space, and yet they managed to take up two with this one as well. Surely this truck was not stuck as well. What stopped them from fixing this one and freeing up a space?\n\nUpon reporting this behavior to the company, I was told by the person named Andrew that I had a personal problem, and that the hotel should deal with the issue if they feel they need to. I should also stop trying to get hard working people in trouble just because I cannot park where I want. Because everyone knows only Scott's Services' workers are hard working - none of the other patrons of the hotel they inconvenienced were hard working people as well.\n\nIn the adult world we do not get \"in trouble\"; We get held accountable for our actions. The company's refusal to hold their employees accountable for their behavior is a clear declaration that the behavior is condoned by the company, and that these actions accurately reflect the values of Scott's Services.\n\nConsider these things when you consider working with them. This is how they might choose to behave.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNotWXTHDswMaStIri7oO1KYTHcdDg-iMZM7EcH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIccL5azPhSQVorayMuH0fSQ-MeP3tLWdwfrfu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYlAUxH76tGUHIMWgqp0OIhoIpA1rtx96Fa9j5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890d91da79e17f:0xb7995bed26179105"}

There is nothing more aggravating than to have your air conditioning unit quit. Although it is mid-October we needed our air conditioning fixed ASAP. Our unit was 17 years old and I knew we needed to replace it if not immediately, within the very near future. I emailed a few companies Saturday night asking for estimates and to please contact me Monday morning. Only Autumn Air and one other company returned my call today. Autumn Air was very pleasant and offered to have someone come out to price the unit immediately. Since I knew I did not want to start throwing money away repairing such an old unit I asked for a quote for a new unit (with and without the furnace). Skip came out and priced the unit with three options and it was clear if I wanted more options he would give them to me. He did not acted putout or frustrated with my request. He did not pressure me to make a decision nor did he push me to buy the most expensive product. Without me asking, he let me know the specials that were being offered. I asked how soon they could install the unit and he said either this afternoon or in the morning. I called my husband and sent him the estimates. My husband was impressed and even showed his fellow employees who were also impressed with the prices. After weighing the pros and cons we decided to replace the entire unit (with furnace). I called Skip back about 2:30 saying we did want to go ahead and replace the unit, he said he would call me right back, that it would be either this afternoon or in the morning. I was floored when he called me back shortly afterwards and asked if it was okay with me if they could install it today. Skip and two other gentlemen came and installed the unit working hard until close to 9:00 pm. We were all extremely grateful to the diligence of these men. In addition, Autumn Air included a 2-year service plan where they will come out to service/clean the unit twice a year. They have earned my trust. I am very thankful to Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSUL9QRFJSPykXqDzrNKpCip6nXxO_y7dxFY68=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2RdAWKk5TI7OZtRl8wgn94aokdQNwgFcu2UXt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEyoCn2esr-2rrYIf35lCntXDGlIln-damn4kj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532696719, "text": "Thank you!!!!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

{"user_id": "117764367263681419355", "name": "John Hosmer", "time": 1505317915712, "rating": 5.0, "text": "For a long while there have been atmosphere issues in our basement where the previous home owners had never taken care of sealing up the rooms and keeping temps and humidity in check. We had addressed those issues and we had tried using good filters at the returns to prevent as much of any dust, mold spores, etc. from recirculating and spreading, but it ended up being a losing battle for both comfort and our family's health.  Finally, about a month ago I disconnected one of the flexpipes at the end of the trunk run to see just how bad it was and found almost 100% coverage of dust, mold, and nastiness throughout the system. It was in every bit of the trunk, and every flexpipe throughout the house (See pictures). Even a few of the vent registers had started harboring mold growth which was a really bad sign as well.\n\nSo, I did what any good panicking homeowner would do at that point. Went to Google, pulled up nearby HVAC companies with good reviews that could do duct replacement, and called for appointments for onsite inspections. Out of the four highly reviewed and reputable companies (minus individual contractors) in the Pelham area that actually showed up for their appointment, Autumn Air's rep Baker was the only one who showed up on time, actually visually inspected inside the ductwork even after I showed him the initial pictures I took, and then spent a solid amount of time explaining to me options for replacing the entire ductwork system so we could see about what would be right for our budget. In the end, the price that Autumn Air was able to provide for an upgrade to a new round smooth metal interior and outside insulated wrapped system, including new boots and registers, throughout the entire house, plus a new central AprilAire Space Guard filtration and iWave-R GPS ionization system upgrade (per my request) beat out the one other company who actually sent me a quote by almost half. Let me say that again differently...TWO of the four companies NEVER sent back a quote. This told me that two of the highly reputable companies in the Pelham area that have a high amount of favorable reviews simply did not want a job. Pitiful for them.\n\nFast forward to the install a week later...Led by two guys named Javy and Charles, they took care of making sure everything was treated with care when taking out the old ductwork so as to minimize spreading of dirt and mold as much as could be. Then, they proceeded to assemble and install all of the new system on site for custom fitting plus making sure all seams were taped properly and coated with mastic so that the chances of air leaks past the coils is forever kept at a minimum. They arrived early in the morning, and worked until the job was finished that evening (on the day of Harvey storms coming through too!).  Any questions I had concerning anything with the job was answered and explained with no hesitation on their part.  They went beyond expectations with accommodations and I just can't be any happier.\n\nI can't say it enough in this entire description here how great Autumn Air is for an HVAC company. They want someone's business in the best way because they give the work the best service they can at reasonable prices, and offer great financing options too if needed. They understand how to go the extra mile to make sure the customer is being taken care of in the end as well. I can say I have also had the pleasure of meeting Jeff, the owner, later when he came back to look at a minor issue that crept up post install, and he is just as awesome about discussing more than the \"here's what we'll do\". He takes the time to explain the why and how's (if you are interested to know and ask) and will work with you as a customer to do everything he can within reason to make sure you are satisfied with him and his company. Because of all of these things described about everyone at that company and how we were treated, we now not only have clean, sanitized fresh air, but the confidence to know it will stay that way due to the complete service and professionalism we got from Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMabAWy162GH96gyl3m37sUEbn3lZkhH_QMnw5p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_X0ScvBCZDov4a77tJ8--jNZxa4SLKPRwf7ZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2_SRCsbshQYMwunCW_Svt09o-TDruxZ8tozW8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKpjJ6ZJSD3l76fC4DaZ5moDrfqENk5DrC3V5m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVryaFeSx9Ipmsmn5UNXwMOBC9HZqnM-6Io7MO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532681755, "text": "Thank you for sharing your review of our company!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

I found Autumn Air online, and even though they weren't in my area, I figured I had nothing to lose trying them. My call was answered professionally, and he took my info and told me that they were pretty full for the day, but that they would try to fit me in. He asked me for details on what was wrong. After about 10 minutes, he called me back saying that they had a cancellation and a tech could be. at the house in about an hour. An hour later the tech was here and within 30 minutes we had cool air!!!
