Working with DSLD owner David Sharp was a pleasure. He responded to my inquiry within a day and met with me within a week to discuss options for landscape and drainage work on my Highland Lakes home--the $100 up-front consult fee was a worthwhile investment, and was applied to to the cost of my project. Work included expanding, grading, and sodding (Zoiysa) the backyard, which included construction of a 70 foot concave curved/step-graduated wall, installing a new drainage system along and under the driveway, and adding an external sump pump well and pump to move water from a tied-in roof downspout and overhead deck drain. DSLD completed the project in approx. 2 weeks.  Good communications throughout, with detail breakdown of proposal costs.  Definately recommend.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893e19213388e5:0xeb3f3999b720c596"}
