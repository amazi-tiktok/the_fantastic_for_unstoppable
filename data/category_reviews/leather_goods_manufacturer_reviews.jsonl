The logo and leather patch look great - but the quality of the hat itself was very poor and noticeably cheap. I compared the size of the bill to the size in their marketing images - and they are two completely different hats. Bait and switch?\n\nMy goal in purchasing one hat was to see the quality and design so I get one for my entire staff. Whoops! Not going to give this hat out to anybody. If it has my brand on it - it has to be high quality, the Holtz custom hat was a disappointment to say the least.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559074824956, "text": "Hey Lawrence,\n\nI am sorry to hear that you are disappointed with your hat. We use Richardson 112 Snapback Hats, which are the same hats as featured in our marketing and website images. They are one size adjustable snapback hats so they look a little different on different people. On our website, the main image is of a woman wearing the hat so the bill does appear larger compared to her head size.

Ordered a wallet to be made from my sons baseball glove from his undefeated high school season to replace a wallet that had been stolen to be given as a Christmas gift on Dec 6 which was 9 days before the \"guaranteed delivery by Christmas\" date in the email blast ad I received.  I'm sure you know where this is going.  Paid my money and waited for the box to arrive to send glove back for production.  Funny thing was I was still receiving email blasts selling the \"guaranteed delivery  by Christmas\" ads. The box finally showed up 11 days later on the 17th.  I know it is Christmas time but that did seem to take longer that it should have taken.  I called the company and was told that there was some delay in shipping (duh). I asked if I sent the glove back right away would they still make the \"guaranteed delivery by Christmas\".   I was told NO WAY with the shipping back and forth and the 2 day production time it wasn't going to happen.  I offered to pay for over night shipping to them which would get the box to them on the 18th - 2 days for production - 20th - they could pick up the tab for over night return getting it back to me on the 21st or the 22nd at the latest.  NO  I offered to pay for the over night shipping both ways.  NO  I asked why not?  Was told we wouldn't have time to make it.  What?  You took the order.  You took the money.  You knew it was to be made.  From the pictures the glove isn't the main part of the wallet. I still needed to get him a wallet....they already had my money....they have a store front... You would think they would try and sell me something.  I was told they have nothing in the store to send me.  What? Nothing in the showcase? Sold out on the 17th of December?\nCancelled the order and was told 2 days to get money back.  It took 4 but I was glad to get it back(haha).  Too bad - I liked the wallet concept.

All my items were shipped on December 12th. A week after Inplaced the order. It is December 17th and I still do not have my items and I just called customer service and it appears I now have 2 tracking numbers rather than the one I was supplied with on December 5th. I purchased monogrammed passport cases for my children as they left on a trip to South Africa on Dec. 16th. I called customer service and they assured me that I would receive my items on Dec. 14th. My children are is South Africa and who knows where my Holtz items are. Never ordering from them again. My advice you should not either!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1545931267473, "text": "Hey Kim,\n\nI'm so sorry your order did not arrive in time for your children to receive them before they left for South Africa! I know how disappointing that must have been, and for that I am truly sorry.  I wanted to address your concerns and see if I can help alleviate some of the frustration and/or stress around this.\n\nThe shipment came in two boxes largely due to the size of products purchased. The box we ship our whiskey barrel marshmallow roasters in is 48x8x8, and that will not hold things like the Vanderbilt journal which is much wider than that box would allow. We take great pride in presentation and want you to receive our products in excellent shape, and as such we are very particular with how we ship everything. I am so sorry if that extra tracking number did not come through to you - those automated emails may have missed that one.\n\nAs for the delay in shipment, we are a small family-owned company that hand crafts each of these products. We put out a very large volume between our online orders and our brick and mortar store in Huntsville - but we do not have the staff to be able to put out products the same day they are purchased - especially at Christmas time. Our lead times definitely lengthen around the holidays; so the priority shipping is an add on just for that method of shipping - it does not remove the production period. I see that you contacted us on the 11th requesting to have it by that Friday, 12/14, and we were actually able to push it out the door on the 12th which should have gotten it to you in time. Unfortunately it got held up at the post office for 4 days, which is why it did not get to you in time.\n\nI know this does not negate the fact that you didn't get your items in time, and again we are so sorry about that!\n\nI hope you had a merry Christmas and your children enjoyed their travels!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886215cba217cce7:0xe04a5ad9b6a5c690"}

We contacted you via the email and phone number you provided on your order, on 4/25, 4/30, 5/3, and 5/6 to get your logo file. Our final email on 5/6 notified you that we would ship the item without the logo if we did not hear back from you. With no response, we shipped your order with only the name on 5/9.\n\nI hate to hear your experience with us did not live up to your expectations. I understand the frustration you must feel to have waited for an order and it is not exactly what you had hoped for. Please contact our Customer Service team at 256-883-1111.
