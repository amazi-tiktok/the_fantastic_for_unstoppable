This lady has a nice space in back for animals but this is not a serious business for her so she is not passionate about providing great service because she probably doesn't really care. Good luck getting a hold of her when you need to. Wish she had simply called and let me know something but absolutely no contact was made and no apology for the inconvenience.

They told me they were looking and had the police and animal control looking too. My family looked for four hours that morning with no sight of the police or animal control looking. When I called on Monday to get an explanation on what happened, they wouldn\u2019t give me information over the phone because I wasn\u2019t the \u201cowner\u201d on paper. It was in my moms name. This was after I paid for the bill and brought him to the vet myself. I had to go up there with my mother to get my refund and a proper explanation. They only gave me a partial refund and no one came to talk to us until I asked for camera footage. The manager was somewhat sincere and I learned that he in fact did not chew through any metal or fence. He chewed through a wooden door and managed to bend the chain link fence to crawl up under it. I got a clear explanation and some of my money back, but have yet to find my dog. They told me they were still looking but I have no way of knowing that. We\u2019ve been searching for a week now and no sightings of him. I was under the impression that he was going to be watched 24/7 since he had never been boarded before but I was wrong.

In addition, MOST of the food we took for the cats was still in the bag...that concerns me as well. My 18 month old cat came home extremely jittery and has been jumping at the slightest noise. I can't say that Piper's did anything wrong, but I will say that our furbies did not come home happy this time.

The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent. This facility is anything but transparent!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb344b45a6c63:0x685d3a5c7b681a37"}

Shaking, limping and handed dirty bedding with no explanation as to how he was injured, why we weren't informed  when it happened plus finding out he'd been very stressed by being kenneled every night in the large room with the large dogs with big dog barks! When I first boarded @ Piper's 2 years ago I requested that he be kenneled at night with only little dogs and was shown a room off the hall on the right where I was told the small dogs stayed. When I asked why he was put in the big room this time with the big dogs she said \"well, you didn't request that he be separated\". If my file had been consulted I'm sure it would reflect my wishes. There was no I'm sorry we didn't contact you about his injury, etc. He literally had to be carried that night and Christmas day every time to potty, to food bowl, etc. While I understand this may not be the norm @ Piper's, ( had never happened to me before) since it happened this time, I'll be making other arrangements next time. Beware. Things are not always as they seem. Ask to see where your dog will be put at night. I was told they  NEVER allow tours! That's shocking! I've ALWAYS toured where I board my dog. Ask what their policy is if your dog becomes injured or sick. I asked when the owner would be there as I wanted to speak in person with them and was told the owner was never at the Anniston location.

We recently purchased one, Ramos, from  Germany.  After about  6 weeks here,  he developed a case of bloat that could have killed him.  With bloat, the stomach actually \"flips over\" and cuts the blood supply off to the stomach, causing a rapid distension, and death if not treated quickly.  Fortunately, Ramos' stomach flipped back without emergency surgery.\n\nNot wanting to go through this again, we researched bloat and found the best \u201ccure\u201d for it is a laparoscopic assisted gastropexy.  In this procedure the dog's stomach is sutured to the abdominal wall. The sutures eventually dissolve but the stomach is held permanently in place by an \"adhesion\" preventing recurrent \"flipping\".  Many animal hospitals do not have a laparoscope or the skill to accomplish this procedure.  Dr. Daniels was able to take care of this surgery and Ramos is 99% normal after five days. He has personally checked on Ramos 4 times on his own time since surgery.\n\nEverything about Drs. Daniels and Clark, and their clinic and team  was strictly professional, yet courteous and friendly.  We can't forget Cassidy, the glue and the center of their clinic.  Exceptional personality and warmth!\n\nIf you are looking for a superior team to take care of your special \u201cfamily member\u201d, consider Dr. Daniels and Clark at Nall Daniels Animal Hospital in Homewood.\n\nNot close enough for you?

The first time I took him for his annual shots and a check up I asked about the small lumps on his body and they said it was nothing. 6 months ago I took him to this office to get a check up because we had some concerns. After paying hundreds of dollars for tests and x-rays, they assured me that there was nothing usual going on with my dog. This week he started getting very sick, and after a trip to a different vet, we found out he had cancer and it was very prolonged and caused other problems like anemia, kidney failure and lesions on his lungs. This kind of progression doesn't happen in 6 months. It happens over years. He had been coming here for years and they never once said anything about the cancer that was all over my dog's body and covering his organs. At this point, he was in too much pain, couldn't eat or drink, and could hardly breathe. The new vet and I decided it was best to put him down so he wouldn't be hurting anymore. After years of coming to the same office they never said anything remotely close to cancer.\n\nThere is nothing I can do for my dog anymore, but there is still something you can do for your's. DO NOT bring your animals to this office. There is no way a cancer this severe goes unnoticed for so long with an office that provides quality care. Find somewhere to take your pets that won't treat them like they treated my dog.

Nall-Daniel\u2019s provides a variety of veterinary services including well pet check ups, grooming, surgery, and prescriptions. We went there for our yearly check up and vaccinations for our two dogs; a senior Golden Retriever, and a six year old mutt. The entrance was very clean and clam. When we got called back, we were in a decent sized examination room with a vet tech, I can\u2019t remember his name, but he was a very kind and patient young man with brown hair. He was very thorough with us; he listened to and answered all of our questions. He even provided us with a printed out quote of what all the shots, the visit, and the treatment for the ear infection that our Golden had, before performing any procedures. Then, Dr. Dunaway came in to examine them. She immediately got down in the floor and started loving on the boys. You could see her passion for animal care when she came in the room. She was very articulate and detail oriented, laying out all of the treatment options for the ear infection and recommending medication for his arthritis, too. Her bedside manner was impeccable and I felt listened to and informed as she explained everything that she was doing. We never felt rushed, even as it got near closing time. All in all, it was a wonderful experience. I had called fifteen clinic before choosing this one. The reason I chose them in the first place was because they were one of the most affordable. Sometimes, affordability comes at the expense of the quality of care, but not here. I could tell they genuinely cared about the well being of our animals, and I think that we have found a lifelong vet!

When I brought her in a week ago, I knew it was probably going to be time to put her down.  She was suffering and could no longer walk.  The staff at Nalls Daniel couldn't have been more kind, caring, gentle, thoughtful, and patient with me and my family.  They made the process as personal and easy as it could be made.  They took good care of my dog and of me until the end.  They were respectful of me and my wishes during this heartbreaking time.\nToday I returned from a luncheon to find beautiful flowers waiting on my porch in memory of Mini from the staff at Nalls Daniel.

I always thought she enjoyed it as she seemed excited to pull up and be dropped off. At around a year old, I started noticing a lot of staff turnover at the facility. Although I should have taken heed, I did not and my dog continued to attend day care regularly. I began noticing that my dog was very timid of the staff. In particular, she was called by one of the managers/trainers and immediately backed up, tail between her legs, and laid down in a submissive position behind me. This time I took note and my dog never returned to the facility. I still have pre-paid day care days that will go unused. When I inquired about my dog\u2019s reaction, it was explained to me by staff that my dog was regularly kept separate in a kennel in the back during the day. AND, that her \u201ctraining\u201d involved being taken into the yard, on a leash, while other dogs were allowed to approach her and she was given commands to obey. THIS RUINED MY DOG. She has dog aggression issues to this day, largely due to her extreme anxiety which I believe was engrained into her at a developmental stage while at JHH.

She at some point mentioned I\u2019m required to pre pay for both dogs (mind you I\u2019ve never used their service and don\u2019t know how I feel about prepaying), as well as for the appointments I missed? Because I didn\u2019t give them a 24 hour notice? My mother fell ill the evening before the appointments were scheduled, it would be impossible to give a 24 hours notice for this.\n\nIt was all very bizarre, and confusing. I\u2019ve used the same groomer for five years, and she recently went out of business and moved states; I\u2019m certain I can find another groomer to take care of my dogs\u2019 needs, but it\u2019s shameful Classy Pup is so tone deaf and belligerent.

You spoke with me the owner.  As I remember our conversation it was several days after your appointment you called to make another one.  No mention of your mothers illness and a very lighthearted  attitude about your missed appointment.  That is a huge deal to a small business, being that we had a hole of 2.5 blocked off hours in our schedule due to your dogs not coming in. Businesses cannot operate that way! And it was an appointment blocked off for 2 dogs... not one.   Our business model requires a prepayment deposit to be make after 2 missed appointments, that will be credited to the following appointment. Two dogs no showing is 2 appointments missed and lost revenue for us. We are not always able to fill those appointments last minute, as was the case. This is only our way of insuring that we will not have an empty slot in the future, not a  harsh personal attack as you infer.\nRegards, Lisa"}, "gmap_id": "0x888922759e8b6b6b:0xb958c1f8ea411005"}

The business is located in the downstairs of a building which you access from behind the building. There is no sign indicating this at the front of the building. When I arrived I parked up front and opened the front door to find an abandoned filthy building. I quickly closed the door and ran back to my car. I almost left then, but decided to drive around behind the building. That is when I saw the downstairs door. The upstairs door should be locked with a sign instructing you to go around back. When you get inside everything looks dated, but that's not the problem. I dropped my dog off at 1030. I was told that she would be done around 2 possibly 3 but that I would receive a call 30 minutes before she was ready. I was also told that she would be taken out of the kennel to walk and for a potty break (although there's no grass for this that I saw). At 1:30 I called to check and was told that it would definitely be 3 but that she would call 30 minutes before she was done and she sounded aggravated that I called. At 230 my husband and I decided to leave to pick up some lunch before picking the dog up, and at 309 I still hadn't heard from her. At that point my dog had been there almost 5 hours so I just headed straight there. I got there and she was still working on my dog but only for about 5-10 more minutes after I got there even though I hadn't received a call that she was 30 minutes from being done. Almost as soon as my dog was on the floor she peed which leads me to believe she was never walked or taken out to potty. She was shaved WAY shorter than I asked for her to be. I asked for a simple trim and instead she was shaved with a #5 blade. The lady argued with me and told me that I told her to cut her short, which I did not do. I was also told that it would be 50$ and I was charged 55$. We will not be back here.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532658787294, "text": "Hi Kendra!

Our sign clearly shows the entrance to our business is the bottom level!   Secondly.... we were nice enough to take your Maltese withOUT an appointment and work it in around our other regular customers.  Our regular price for our small dogs is $55.00 and I usually charge a bit more for people without appointments .. so thats what we get for being nice to first time customers! Thirdly.... your dog was the LAST to come in... so it was the LAST to go out. It wouldn't have been fair to the other owners now.... would it?  Lastly... your dog was not in good shape so it had to be taken down short as I explained when you picked her up. Your dog also pee pee'd and poo poo'd in her cage as soon as you  dropped  her off so yes... she was walked thoroughly after that..... and Yes.... we have a very large dog run right next to the shop which you again did not observe... and plenty of grass out back!

I debated on not going back after that but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. A few weeks later, my puppy contracts Kennel Cough from there which ultimately developed into pneumonia. As any other pet parent, I was angry because every dog is supposed to be fully vaccinated in order to attend there. $250 later, thankfully, he made a full recovery. I didn\u2019t take him back for weeks because I was paranoid. However, I moved closer to the area and decided to give it another shot. Took him back on a Friday. A few days later, I notice he isn\u2019t feeling well & end up having to take him to the emergency vet at 2:30 am. What have you know, Kennel Cough AGAIN.

Our COVID Care protocols have definitely made it much more difficult for our staff to interact with our clients with conversations.  We have really missed these interactions too!  We do feel strongly that our curbside dropoff/pickup services as well as our staff wearing full PPE is in the best interest of our community, our clients, and our staff - but it has definitely left us missing those close interactions and relationship building with our clients.  I'm sorry you missed that too.  We are definitely learning how to best create relationships with our clients in the climate of COVID safety.  Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to grow and change with these new and ever changing restrictions.\n\nI'm also sorry to hear your pup got cough while he was participating in our services.  This particular strain of cough this year has actually made several national news stories as it has shown up all over the country.  It's been a nasty strain.  We worked very closely with our veterinary advisory team to be sure we were utilizing the absolute best practices in cleanliness and disinfectant protocols throughout our facility.  We also did our best to inform all clients honestly and openly about the outbreak.  We feel very fortunate that we were able to get it under control so quickly because of our amazing veterinary advisory team.  Just like childcare, dog daycare does pose a slightly higher risk of dogs getting upper respiratory infections and sometimes GI upset in group play.  We do our very best to inform our clients of this by having it clearly stated in several places on our General Client Agreement all clients receive and sign before their first day of daycare with us.  While we sincerely wish the bordatella vaccine required by our facility was able to protect against all cough, just like the human flu vaccine, it does not.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your feedback and wish you and your dog well and that you are able to find another facility that suits your needs.  Please let us know if we can help you with any pet care needs in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923bd8bf81a99:0xf88dcba01a8213d"}

However, I found the classes to be ridiculously unprofessional. They charge the going rate, $20 per 1 hour class session for 4 sessions. However, the classes never start on time, the instructor is rarely prepared with her materials, generally she is looking at her phone several times per lesson and disappearing into another room, and 2 of 4 classes ended early. The instructor clearly knows how to train a dog, however this place has a business model based on you dropping your dog off for several weeks and a thousand or more dollars later they train the dog for you. I have no doubt she is exceptionally effective in that environment, but these classes where you learn to train your dog yourself are over complicated, incoherent, and lack any kind of structure. I feel like mostly they are used to get you to admit you need to drop your dog off with them, because that is the only way the dog will get trained. I've had better experiences with a big box store training, and that isn't saying much. There are significantly better training places for the same money with a whole lot less agenda. Hint: look for a non-profit dog obedience and training club.<P>\n\nResponse to the owner:\nFirst off, it's labelled a rolling class. You don't need to offer \"a missed class at no extra charge\", that's part of it being rolling. You show up for 4 classes, whether they are consecutive or not, and I checked ahead of time to make sure that was the case. Second, in 3 of the 4 classes there was no socialization time unless you count the period of time we all waited in the office while the instructor was running late. Ending the class early twice ensured no socialization time. You offer 14 days of board and train for $1100 and 28 days for $2100. Both of those cost more than the thousand dollars I put in my review. So yes, you offer both cheaper and more expensive options, personally I think I hit the middle pretty well with my review. I put in my review you charge the going rate. I don't dispute that. I also said the trainer knows how to train dogs, the trainer simply didn't do much to help people learn to train their own dogs in this one class. Finally, the Birmingham Obedience and Training club is a non-profit club, they just aren't a charity.

I am the owner of Roverchase and you have not contacted us in your 4 week training so, until this review, I was unaware of your unhappiness.  I have called the other puppies in your class period and they have all been exceptionally pleased and have all signed up for additional group classes for continuing education, so I am a bit confused.  I would be more than happy to talk with you about your experience.  I do know that your dog missed a week of Puppy Kindergarten and we were very happy to accommodate your schedule and allow you to makeup your missed class at no additional charge.     Puppy Kindergarten is a socialization and basic manners class and not a true \"training skills\" course.  This is very clear in the description of our class on our website as well as the materials given in each class period.  As mentioned previously, I would be more than happy to speak with you about your experience, please feel free to call the front office at 205-332-0203 and ask for Abigail.  Also, as a note, our day-training program is our most popular program but it is hardly \"thousands of dollars.\"  Most of our clients spend between $250-450 for four weeks of all day training where they drop their dog of several times a week each week.  This is hardly \"thousands of dollars\" and is, in fact, some of the best prices is town.  Our Puppy Kindergarten class is also priced competitively with \"the big box store\" but you are taking this class from one of the most highly experienced and certified canine behavioral consultants in the city.  As an additional note, our prices are less expensive then the Obedience Club in our town, which is not non-profit.

Aidan did a great job and took time to work on things that I specifically was having trouble with when there was not a big class. I took my dog to daycare and the owner, Abigail, stated that he was having trouble and recommended a behaviorist that comes to Roverchase every Thursday and Saturday. The price was $400 dollars which I was happy to pay because I really wanted the best for Blue (my dog). We talked with the behaviorist for about an hour and that was the end of the session. The behaviorist did not really teach or show me anything that I did not already know. The behaviorist did not even see the behavior that I was having trouble with but yet she was quick to write out a treatment plan. The behaviorist did say that I would need to do private lessons with Abigail which is not included in the cost. So for $400 dollars I talked to a lady for an hour. This is a big scam and I am really troubled that Roverchase would be a part of it.\n\nMy appointment lasted 1 hour. We left right after 5 and the appointment started at 4. So go back and check your cameras again. Yes, I was happy to pay the $400 dollars which I stated previously. But I was under the impression that I would get useful information and more than just talking to a \"Behaviorist\" for an hour. Again, how can she, the behaviorist, tell me what is the cause and real problem without even seeing the behavior. I even emailed the behaviorist trying to get a refund because that was not what I was expecting. Not even wanting a full refund because I understand that she did take time out of her day to meet with me. But I think she can keep the $80 dollars deposit and refund the $320 since I do not need her \"expertise\" any longer. But she has not responded to my email which she specifically stated was the best/fastest way to communicate with her. And as far as reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith...I did that. You decided to lie on your response by saying that you checked the cameras and that I was there for a little under 2 hours. Your cameras times are off or you lied. I told you that I actually loved Roverchase. I even recommended people go to y'all which only one of them did but one is better than none. But I do still think that I was scammed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1525838804535, "text": "Dear Mr. Auer,\nI\u2019m so surprised to read your review regarding your experience with Blue and Dr. Beihunko, Roverchase, and the chain of events you described.  I appreciate you giving me the opportunity on this public platform to respond.\nFirstly, I\u2019m so glad you were pleased with your group classes at Roverchase with our trainer Aidan.  He\u2019s so talented and our clients just adore him.  I\u2019ll be sure to pass on your praise.  Thank you.\nTo address your concerns regarding your experience with Dr. Biehunko, I will do my best to address them in an organized fashion.\n-  I recommended Blue see Dr. Biehunko when Blue presented to daycare last week after a 5 month absence from Roverchase.  Prior to Blue\u2019s absence, we had discussed at length Blue\u2019s increase reactivity and dog related aggression and you indicated you did not want to address it with us at that time but wanted to work with it on your own.  We advised against it.  When you presented last week, Blue came for a day of daycare and was significantly worse in all behaviors.  I recommended a consultation with Alabama\u2019s only Veterinary Behaviorist, Dr. Biehunko.  I thoroughly explained how Dr. Beihunko\u2019s consultations worked, that they were $400 and for that price you received a 1.5-2hr consultation with her expertise and she would make a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and then have 6 months of medical management and follow up.  I was very clear with you that there was no doubt that Blue would need additional lessons with me and that it would be at additional cost.  You remarked that you felt this price was fair for her experience and expertise and made your appointment for later in the week\n- I do rounds with Dr. Biehunko each day for our shared clients.  She had already been thoroughly briefed on Blue\u2019s behavior at Roverchase the day he returned as well as my notes from his behavior in December when we last saw him.\n- Your consultation with Dr. Biehunko was just barely under 2hrs.  I checked the time stamp on our cameras\n- In your consultation with Dr. Biehunko we were all very surprised to hear that you insisted that Blue has received no training outside of his training at Roverchase.  In fact, you insisted this was true even when specifically questioned about this by Dr. Biehunko and the Roverchase trainers who sat in on the session with you.  As I\u2019m sure you know, it\u2019s extremely difficult for any doctor to communicate effectively and efficiently with a client when that client willfully withholds pertinent information from that doctor that impedes the treatment plan.  As you can see from the attached screen shots, not only has Blue been in training with another trainer, but it was for the very issue he was presenting for.\n- Finally, since your consultation was just over 72 hours ago, and we are very clear that treatment plans can take 2-4 weeks to become effective, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can already be so unhappy with your results.\nI certainly believe that pet owners are allowed to train and handle their pets as they see fit and that there are many fits available for many different preferences.  However, I hope we can both agree that reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith and this one has some glaring issues.  I hope, in light of this, and in light of you many months of happiness with Roverchase, you will consider removing it.  We certainly wish you and Blue only the very best and much success in all of your endeavors.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAbigail Witthauer\nRoverchase\n\nEDIT::  attachment will not post.\nDescription of photo attachment:  Blue the dog on a trainers business page looking at the screen wl a clearly visible electronic training collar, caption from the trainer, \u201cBlue the Australian Cattle Dog rocked his first lesson.

In the winter there are heaters for each room that lower from the ceiling so dogs aren't cold. the cats have the cat trees in them so they'll have a place to curl up that's cozy and comfy.\nThe reviewer who said that it looks like they live near a bunch of meth addicts is ignorant.  The road to the Montevallo Doghouse does have mobile homes along it but most are well kept. That customer is so rude to assume that all people who live in mobile homes are addicts.

They were kind and compassionate and my short experience with them were wonderful. But the lady working the reception...by far the WORST encounter I have ever had.\nI am not one to complain, I do not believe \"the customer is always right\" and I also understand sometimes you just catch people on a bad day, but even on my WORST day I have never treated another person the way this woman treated me.\nLong story short, I took a dog in off the street, she turned out to be pregnant and had a litter of 10 puppies. At six weeks old I vaccinated them and de-wormed them, however one was failing to thrive. She quickly became ill and lethargic. I called to get an appointment to have her be seen. (My regular vet was absolute packed out due to the holiday weekend and suggested I call around to try to be seen as quickly as possible) I booked an appointment with Forrest Vet Clinic for later that day. However, the puppy quickly took a turn for the worst and so I rushed her in to be seen early. I knew enough to know it wasn't parvo (and it wasn't) but the dog was definitely suffering from something serious.\n\nThe receptionist greeted me with absolute contempt. While the dog convulsed and whimpered she stood there arguing that I never told her the dog was sick (of course I did but I was too polite to argue) she then curls her lip and says \"you probably haven't even vaccinated it!\" I explained I did and told her the brand used. She goes off on me. Rolled her eyes, told me I wasn't qualified, lectured me about how I had no clue to be buying some shot from a co-op (they were vet recommended and exceptionally reviewed vaccines by the way) all the mean while the dog is suffering terribly and shes too busy rolling her eyes at me to see anything is done about it.\nHer terrible behavior continues until I feel about as big as an ant and like I am human garbage. You would of thought I was some back yard breeder who brought in a trash bag of starved puppies and dumped them in her cornflakes.\nShe continued to roll her eyes and curl her lip and snarl remarks at me until my sobbing 7 yr old whispers to me \"mommy why is that lady making mean faces to you?\" She announces loudly (but to no one because the place was all but empty) \"that dog could have any contagious thing and we don't want it spreading it around. (understandably but come on, have some discreetness)\nWhen the vet saw the pup he was incredibly kind about it, the tech was very compassionate and concerned for my nearly traumatized child who watched the pup convulse and die.\nWhen it was all over I gathered what little nerves I had left and asked through humiliation and tears what the vet would charge to have the puppies de-wormed again at their office. The receptionist snarled yet again and said \"Well I don't know. Who knows what you've given them and what you haven't and when!\" and huffed at me.\nI was tempted to take the remaining 9 (and exceptionally healthy and thriving pups) and dump them in her lap and ask her to so kindly home and feed and medicate and adopt out a group of rescue mutts in the middle of summer.\nI was doing everything I could to keep this litter out of the humane society and it's been no easy financial or emotional task, but this cruel ladies absolute lack of compassion and decency had be more humiliated and disgusted then I have ever been. I had to pull over on the way home and just cry from the stress and humiliation of the entire experience.\nI am not a breeder, these were rescues, I intend to ask no money for any of these precious puppies, and until I find them safe and loving homes I will be footing the bill for vaccines, food, etc. It's expensive and stressful but I am not some careless human garbage and never should of been spoken to as such.\nSo beware. It's a shame because the rest of the clinic seemed absolutely lovely, but I would crawl through hot sand and razor blades before I ever faced that woman at the desk again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec62749e7f94f:0x636803f2190fa082"}
