I was completely calm and understanding about it but it was my favorite pistol and its no longer complete and they did nothing to make it up to me.Then the next day I went in under an employees promise to give me a decent deal on a hi power clone that had 1 mag and no box. Needless to say I was lead in the wrong direction and i was embarrassed in front of my mother and it really hurt my feelings to be lied to. I would still shop there because I support local businesses but it wont be in the amount I used to. The one good thing i could say about them is up until recently they were fair on their pricing.

In the same way you are unable to haggle at the local supermarket, you can\u2019t haggle with us. After all, there\u2019s only but so much a small business can discount in order to remain profitable.\n\nAs far as our prices go, we do not follow the inflated internet prices like many of our local competitors do (who have much higher prices than we do), but rather we adjust our prices as our suppliers adjust theirs. It is simple supply and demand economics, and during the COVID-era it demand has gone up while access to supply has gone down. That is completely out of our control. Again, we are a business and have to make a profit to keep the doors open.

He was extremely kind and helpful. He knew his blade steels, didn't make me feel rushed, was really glad to show me anything I wanted to see and had a great retail personality. I've worked in retail management all my adult career. The personality of the salesman, and their willingness to show me products without making me feel like a hinderance are the two things I really look for in a retail store. This store delivered. I also spoke with two other employees briefly (an older gentleman with a fantastic beard and a younger girl). Both of them were kind and attentive. Their prices are a little high compared to online prices (specifically BladeHQ) but they DO price match, and they don't make a big deal out of doing it like some stores in Florence/Huntsville do. Overall this seems like a fantastic store and I will be back once I've decided on which model knife I want to buy. When you are able to make the customer WANT to buy from your store instead of ordering online then you've done your job as a retail associate. These guy definitely did it.

I traded at Goldmine Pawn because Tom the owner and his employees have been friendly and knowledgeable. However today\u2019s experience was far under par. I was attempting to transfer ownership of a gun my friend no longer wanted, during the process my friend tried to get clarification on a question being asked on the questionnaire from  an employee.

I asked her to please be more pleasant when she expressed herself. At this the young gentleman waiting on us went off and said they were married and tore up everything.

You cannot be upset with how long a transaction is taking (part of which is out of our control) while simultaneously complaining about our efforts to train new people. Lastly, are you aware that nearly all gun stores have security cameras? Is that still an infringement on your rights? We also have a copy of your ID when buying a gun. Taking a picture of our customers (not just gun customers) for our internal system has been our policy for years with no complaints.

Andy was nice when I picked up the trailer, and I told the woman there \u2013 his wife, I think \u2013 that I didn't want the insurance because American Express would cover it. They charged me for insurance anyway. I had to keep the trailer two extra days because I had trouble with my truck, and when I called to tell Andy I was bringing it back, he gave me the total. I said it was wrong, but they wouldn't fix it. I called U-Haul and was told they would call Depot to straighten it out, but he still overcharged me and was rude about it. I told him I'd told the woman I didn't want the insurance, but he refused to take it off and said it was between me and U-Haul, after the U-Haul rep already confirmed to me that I was being overcharged. Then he acted like he was doing me a favor by taking one day's rental off because I was a little late bringing it back today. I said that was because I was on the phone with U-Haul disputing the charge, but he still acted like he was being nice. Not nice at all. I don't appreciate being conned and then treated rudely. This is why I didn't want to go to Depot in the first place. I don't like dealing with pawn shops and don't want to give them my money.

I'd like to ask you to reconsider after I explain the prices. This past year has been really difficult to find ammo because of Covid and extreme demand. We can not buy it through our normal wholesale routes so we are literally just buying it from whoever we can find it with online. So, we are paying markup-ed prices plus tax, plus shipping that we do not normally have to pay. We personally made a decision to only mark up ammo at the most $3. A lot of what we have, we only mark up $1 to try to keep the price down. We aren't making much money but at least we have product on the shelves where the other local stores and pawn shops do not.  It's only been very recently where the big box stores have started to get some ammo in. Unfortunately, the small mom and pops like us still haven't been offered any inventory. This is why the prices are unusually high. Under normal circumstances, we have the best prices around."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ccf3dda1ce0e7:0x8d68c6b79d097fb7"}

A couple of months back I bought a 9mm Taurus hand pistol we did all the proper paperwork and I was approved. In may I got in a bind and went to redstone pawn as I have in the past and got a loan on my gun. When I came back to pick it up  wes made me take another background check and said that I was delayed and to come back in a cpl of days. First off I should have not had to go threw that process again the gun was already mine and I have a receipt of proof of ownership, I was just paying back my loan and picking up my property. When he contacted me back a couple of days later he didn't call he texted me and said i was denied and kept my gun that I have receipt of ownership for nor did he give the full value of the gun he gave me the loan money back mind you I have an expired gun permit. This was a scam to cheat a customer out of money and his property and i want stand for it, I'll be taken more legal action against this business and show them that you can't treat people like this. I was a good customer to them and they handled me very rough and not fair at all, businesses like this get over because as consumers we dont know the law in Alabama you only have to a permit to carry a firearm not to own one. They violated my second amendment right also no way I failed a background check I work for DHR and I passed the first one I took for the gun nothing has changed so why did I fail this time.

They take the time to explain what it takes to fire at the range with ease, and have a cushy waiting area to view a quick training video. The whole process was smooth and easy.\n\nThe range safety officers are well on their game. I felt safe the entire time on the range, and they were able to quickly explain the touch screen track interface, and further explaining that safety is a top priority.\n\nI signed on for 30 minutes, and decided to fire my .40 before testing the shotgun. The touch screen interface has me sold on coming back to bullet and barrel. With just a click, the target goes the exact distance. Takes all the guesswork out of the experience.\n\nI fired my pistol, and was pleased with the range itself. The design is new and clean. And with the RSOs keeping an eye on everything, it's a great environment to enjoy your firearms.\n\nI tried the 88, and it performed beautifully. I added some extra cushion due to a shoulder injury. For those that would ask, you can't shoot bird shot here. But you can fire buck shot and slugs. But I'll tell you, it's fun firing a shotgun at this range.\n\nAfterward I wandered around and struck up conversations with some of the staff, and showed me a selection for sale. I was impressed with the inventory, as well as pricing. I see myself buying my next firearm from here.\n\nFor me, it's a bit of a drive from Madison.

I have never in my life had someone treat me the way this employee did. If I knew her name I would absolutely call her out. This was at the Trussville location and there were only two employees that I saw. But it was the woman that happen to be available when I came into the store. She was a straight up ass hole. Rolling her eyes when I asked a question as if it was the dumbest thing she had ever heard.  Or as if I was waisting her time. As I told her what I needed to pawn her attitude towards me was hateful from the start the least she could do is be polite and say that they were not interested in what I was trying to pawn at the time. Instead she said she would maybe give me a dollar for it. As she laughed under her breath. That behavior was so uncalled for. And then when I pointed out something on the clearance table that was still marked 60 dollars she stomped her foot and in a aggrevated tone said ok fine let me see it. Now I understand what she was telling me. And I understand why that product that was similar to mine was on the clearance table because it wasn't  selling well. But none the less it was still worth more than a dollar. But she apparently thought I could not comprehend that because of  her childish body gesture's. What she would not take the time to hear was that I had no intention of letting my item be sold in the store. I just needed to pawn it for a little while because life is not easy sometimes but thanks for making my day a little brighter. I wasn't looking for sympathy when I went in, but is it to much to ask for you to just be polite to someone you don't know.   Finally I said to the woman, \" you know what, I haven't done anything to you to deserve such a attitude. I will never be back to this store again.\" And then she had the audacity to reply with, \" good deal you have a great day!\" GOOD DEAL!!!! Are you kidding me. If you hate your job that much then go do something else instead of being a jerk to your customers I really don't think the owner would appreciate that at all. I know if I had worked hard enough to open three different location and had all that going the last thing I would want is people walking through my doors to be treated that way. But I didn't act a fool because I have more class than that I just kept walking and took my business to another pawn shop who did let me pawn my item and gave me way more than a dollar for it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890c6f9f2ccc9d:0x4a0af5af35d1fd24"}

He did offer me a full refund, but I told him that it wasn't about the money for me. He needs to do more research on his own and take care of ALL military members or no one at all!

I explained that I had read about the business online and wanted more information about renting guns and test firing on the gun range.  It was at this point that I was told there were new requirements to be able to use the range.  First requirement was to determine why I wanted to use the range.  Second requirement was that an individual had to have someone with them with a pistol permit, to which I replied that I did.  At this point it all started to seem like he was just making things up because he had decided he wasn't about to let me use the range.  He then asked how many rounds I had shot.  I explained that I had taken a course with my local police department and had spent time shooting a 9mm, a .40 caliber and my .38 special.  I told him maybe 100 rounds to which he said his requirement was 150 rounds.  He told me to bring an experienced person back with me before I could use the range.

To the guy who said he has the only gun range around mobile so he thinks he can charge what he wants.... You sir are an idiot. There are a total of 4 gun ranges in mobile. Do some research before you pop off at the mouth degrading the way some one runs there business. The other gun ranges in mobile all charge the same amount to shoot. You too can get over yourself. I have done business with robert and many other gun stores in mobile. I prefer going to robert because he takes care of me. I may not agree with some of the things he does or the way he does things but in the end, I got what I came for and got it at a good price with friendly service.

I was contacted the next day and told it was fixed. I told him I was unable to come to the store that day, but would contact them the following Tuesday, because they're closed on Mondays. Not wanting an out of the box repaired gun, I asked for a refund, at which time, my request  refused and was hung up on by the store owner.

I was told that the shop would stand behind the ring and wrote the details about the ring on my receipt that they would guarantee.\n\nThe next day I went to a local jewelry store to see what kind of deal I got.  Man was I surprised - I not only got a confirmation of the details of the ring were 100% correct - I was told that the ring was worth 5 times what I paid for it......I couldn't have been happier.\n\nTo know that I got a great deal on a great piece of jewelry alone would bring me back to this store.

Fort Knox safes are probably the beefiest and best-made safes the average consumer can buy.\n\nThis merchant works out of a structural steel building on the same property as their home, so if you drive up the driveway, turn left at the top and you'll see the building.\n\nThis is not a plush showroom; think of it more like a warehouse. It's not fancy, but the prices are reasonable, and the staff is very knowledgeable. They do sell other brands (including imports from China), but Fort Knox is their best brand; they even carry vault doors.\n\nThe purchase price does not include delivery, and delivering the safe into a building incurs a variable fee, depending on the difficulty of setting it in place. You can send a video of the path into the final position to the merchant, and they can decide what the fee will be.\n\nI enjoyed working with the sales staff (especially their rodent-control specialist, a 17-year-old brindled cat with a sweet personality), but unless you live nearby, I think I would recommend visiting their Florence location, as the trip from Huntsville took about two hours and ran through the Bankhead Forest.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8887e6910f01c3ad:0x7eaa2a6561ab97d9"}

I talked with Nancy. I was asked by my business partner to call and find out what options we had to get into a steel door with a keycode lock where the batteries had died. At some point the packet with the keys had been lost either during transit or by the end customer. When I told her that I was calling on behalf of my business partner, she immediately cut me off and told me \"I already told him once that he has to contact Browning because he has to replace that whooole lock system. They only have one set of keys per lock and their all different keys so he's going to have to replace that whole thing\". The delivery of this was with a very transactional tone so the customer service aspect was not great. One of the reasons that I was calling her was to verify what model of lock they actually sold our customer but after the initial interaction, I really didn't want to talk to her further so I called the next company in the chain of distribution. The problem with the lock system that was sold is that it is electronic and the batteries lock to the inside so there is no access once they die unless you have a key, and if there is no key, then you are looking at a major intervention. Again, I'm not blaming this company for the loss of the key, just a note about the transactional nature of the customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8887e6910f01c3ad:0x7eaa2a6561ab97d9"}

Yes - it was long, but it's not the fault of the employee, she was working as quickly as she could despite the occasional random customer walked up & interrupted her with some  question, meanwhile she's trying to continue checking out the many patiently-waiting customers in inline. Let's all remember the employees deserve our appreciation & patience during busy shopping times...and they don't make more money during those times, just more stress while the corporate folks take in the sales profits. Just try to treat everyone with the same respect you would like to receive from them.  And Academy employees deserve raises & more hired staff to create a sales team force!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c40d19dfb2d:0x98f12f478f5c3c31"}

I talked with the salesman in the back and notified him of our mission and asked him if they could give us some kind of discount and was told no. I asked him to ask the manager and he did and the manager said no. When checking out of the store the manager was up front chit chatting with an employee and a customer ( doing nothing) and I again asked him face to face if he could help us out and he again said no. All the other companies have been good about discounting supplies. Lowe's of Wetumpka,  Marvins in Millbrook,  Harbour Freight,  Home Depot all have been helpful especially Lowe's in Wetumpka. After being told no face to face I told him I appreciated it and then proceeded to name the other companies that have responded responsibly.

I just went online ordered a pair of shoes stated I could pick up at the store within the hour. I received a call from the store that they didn\u2019t have my item and that it would be best if I canceled my order. That my money hadn\u2019t been taken out of my account. I tried to cancel online but it kept freezing up. I called the corporate customer service waited on hold for over 30 minutes and then they cut my call off. I then called the Decatur store back and ask for a manager. The girl that answered said \u201c I\u2019m a manager\u201d she was short and rude with me . Said they would cancel my order and I would get a email or text when it was taken care of. I did receive it and it stated my money would not be back in my bank account until 7 business days. So isn\u2019t that great!! Academy ruins a Christmas present for my daughter. And has not a second thought or concern for me . I tried to do the right thing order from home social distance for everyone\u2019s safety and this is the thanks I get. I paid for an item last spring $ 700 and basically the same thing happened only difference is they didn\u2019t have my purchased item so I had to buy a $100 higher item of the same kind. I guess you make so much money that I make no difference. So I am sure I won\u2019t be missed. But very poor service and no compassion for taking someone\u2019s money at Christmas..
