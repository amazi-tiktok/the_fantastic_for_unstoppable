I was going to roll with the punches since the company was a sub under Woodland Homes but since old Google wants to know...my opinion. Horrible company!!!! If I could give it a negative star I would. This company has no pride in their work. They laid our sod all kind of crazy in the dead of winter and didn't roll it properly. If not careful one could easily break an ankle. They turned our sprinkler heads against the house and garage like idiots and quite a few were broken. It's the work of 2 year olds. And, it's a non warranty service so there lies the problem. If most are doing a job they never have to return to then they are not going to put too much pride in doing the job. Every home in this subdivision has issues with the sprinkler systems Largen installed. Company and companies who use and treat people unfairly...well we all know what happens. I would never recommend a company who lacks integrity and customer satisfaction. They are horrible!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886200e09e5cdb09:0xec31a4310d788318"}
