They were so very welcoming and sincere in their love. The preacher gave plenty of scripture during the sermon, which is a must for me. I enjoyed it. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because they do not have a true children's church. They have a daycare area though. Also, there was no choir or praise and worship team. They sing from hymnals. It's just not my personal preference. With that said, I would go back for just the people. They were truly awesome.\nNote: This church pops under African American churches but it is predominantly white.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862680dc5e00603:0x25cd5095f9645d5c"}

I find his teaching very thorough, challenging and humble.\nThe fact that he doesn\u2019t use the KJV was a huge plus for me ( someone mentioned it as a negative) because I truly believe there are more accurate translations out there than the KJV.\n\n( disclosure about why we settled on another church: our family is a family of 5 and we simply have different needs and personalities so another church in the area came in first place when we all voted.

I equate their adult Sunday School classes to seminary-style classes, with different levels based upon your current understanding of various Biblical truths.  The children's and youth classes are focused on teaching Scripture in a God-centered way.
