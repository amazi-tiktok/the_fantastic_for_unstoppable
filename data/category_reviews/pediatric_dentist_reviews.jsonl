If you don't have lots of money, no worries. They will work with you and allow you to make payments. Jamie, the lady who handles the financial part of the business is a sweetheart.

The dental hygienist, Renae, worked through her lunch break to perform a periodontal treatment on me because I told her it was VERY important that I had it done before the next week. The dentist, listen, you will read reviews saying that she's rude, etc. My goodness, here in the south we tend to be big babies. She isn't rude, at all. She's just very professional and straight to the point. I am sure that she never intended to come across as rude to anyone that's just how she may seem but NOT rude, by any means. I, also, read a lot of reviews where people complained that they tried to force them to buy a toothbrush or only cared to make money. I have a feeling that all of these people, unfortunately, misunderstood a lot. They, too, told me about a certain type of toothbrush and gave me a pamphlet on it. There is nothing wrong with feeling strongly about a toothbrush. Electric toothbrushes clean your teeth and gums far more thoroughly than one that is not. I am sure that the dental hygenist, who recommended the toothbrush to me, doesn't pocket a dime for the people who purchase the toothbrushes. Please don't be misinformed or mislead by other reviews.

I visited this location about a year and a half ago and everything was fine.  Had initial appointment where they did Xrays and evaluation and then had four teeth pulled the next day.  Was way overcharged compared to other dentists in the area, but because they were able to extend a credit line I paid the over priced services for relief from tooth pain with little money out of pocket.  Fast forward to today.  I have severe tooth pain that has had me away all night. I called at 7:30 this morning and the lady that took my call offered me appointments starting at 7:45 (which was the earliest appointment and I took it), and then just about every 15 mins increments after that for the rest of the day.  When we got to my name and information, she stated I was already in their system and would need to call back when the office opened to schedule my appointment.  I just called to schedule the appointment and they can not see me until late afternoon. I asked the lady could they not see me this morning, that I was in a lot of pain and had been up all night and she said no, that 2:30 was the earliest they could see me.  So I questioned why \"new\" patients could be seen as early as 7:45 am and every 15 mins forward, and walk in patients as their website says, can be seen this morning, but existing patients who have already spent a LOT of money with them are not able to be seen until later in the day.  She had no answer other then that is the earliest I could be seen.  Not to mention, even though it has only been a year and a half, I have to do all the exam and Xrays all over again just like a new patient, would not be treated that day for what was hurting and  would have to schedule another appointment to have any work done after the initial appointment.  So this place wants to charge me to complete new patient services, however does not want to give me new patient scheduling times.  I was willing to pay their ridiculous costs because I still have $3000 in credit with their finance company, but I refuse to sit her in pain all day while they schedule new patients in front of me............   Terrible, awful and ungrateful staff and services. Will not recommend and will advise everyone I know against them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1582667067511, "text": "I certainly understand your frustration.

I looked at the papers they have me and they charged me 3 and 4 times for the same thing, then told me that the teeth cleaning is charged for each quadrant of my teeth. This was never explained to me and I have never been to a dentist that charged that way, they did the same thing that other dentist do, and charged me for each quadrant of my teeth, said I had a gum disease, my gums are pushed up over my enamel on my teeth caused from me over brushing them, and brushing them the wrong way,, I did this when I was a child and brushed my teeth 8 to 10 times a day, because my Mom's teeth were so bad and I have seen her in so much pain from bad teeth, so I was over brushing my teeth. I was told that everything would be charged through Genesis Credit, I got a card from the credit company and never activated it... But they don't tell you that the charges are for your first visit only.. Then get the bill and for the few things they did my bill was $1013 and some change.. I went to only get a filling done on a tooth and the dentist was drilling out my tooth that needed filled and kept bouncing off my tooth he was drilling on and kept bouncing off my tooth and hitting a tooth behind the one he was working on, so now I have the tooth he kept hitting with the drill that has to be filled.. I was suppose to go back to get my 2nd cleaning and I was told I would have to pay them in cash for it, then found out that it had already been charged on the credit company, so there they thought they were going to get paid twice,, so Aspen Dental was going to make you pay 2 times for the same thing, as they did on my bill... I was told that the special mouth rinse and special toothpaste was included with the Oral B toothbrush kit, and looked on my papers and was charged 3 and 4 times each for the mouth rinse and toothpaste.. This is the worse dental place I have ever been to... And I have called the Customers Care line and am told they would have someone call me by tomorrow, I have been told this for several times, and the ones that call me tell me to call back if they haven't called me within 2 days, to call them back.. I have been calling them since right after I had my dental appointment and got the paperwork on all the charges and I almost fell over,, I was lied to by the employees, the dentist, and customer care... This is ridiculous... Aspen Dental is a ripoff.. Everyone I have talked to that has been there has nothing good to say about Aspen Dental in Gadsden Alabama.. I have tried to get this straighten out about being overcharged on what was done, and am always told if you don't hear back from me in 2 days, to call back, I have been doing this for months, and they have done nothing to resolve this problem... So my advice to everyone that is bringing about going to Aaron Dental in Gadsden Alabama DON'T USE THEM, THEY ARE CROOKS!!!!!!!...This is the sorriest place I have ever been to... I'm trying to get this straighten out or I'm going to turn them in to the Better Business Bureau, and see if they can do something about them!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3ecf41307ffb:0x4b5df95bcb483c3f"}

This facility is very new and clearly they need to meet there quota to pay it off. Staff is very nice but when it comes to experience and knowing what they are doing, the lack all of the above. Went to have a simple cleaning and they tell me I have a gum disease. Ok, fair enough I use to smoke so it happens. So I proceed to allow them to do the procedure but wait first I had to pay $180 before I could have any treatment which to my understanding was suppose to cover everything and my insurance cover the rest. Then we go on. They say one of my back teeth js decaying and needs to be uprooted. I allow it to happen because I had bothered me for years. In the most of pulling the tooth the dentist breaks the bone off that holds the tooth in process of pulling it. I told him multiple times before pulling it that I would soon be getting braces and I didn't want that to affect it. Well now that has caused issue with getting braces. So on, I have cavities. A total different dentist is doing this procedure days later. He and the women helping carried on the whole time and was more focused on there conversation than fixing my Cavaties. That being said he didn't fill the tooth the complete way so now I have sensitivity for sweet hot and cold things. The other day I get a bill from them. $172 it was. Going back to the gym disease. I had to \"pay everything up front\" before I could have the procedure done right. At least that's what the lady said. I just got off the phone with them. They begin to tell me the bill is only $126.??? So why did I get billed $50 more than that.

The very first visit back in June to get my sons teeth cleaned for the first time Dr. Curtis was very nice and patient but my son was very calm and did everything that was asked of him. So we\u2019ve had to wait two months to try and get a cap on my sons tooth because of scheduling. which is fine but after all that happened we didn\u2019t even get to have it done. It was my sons first time being in an actual dentist chair and laying down. So obviously he was scared. Between the very sweet hygienist and I we calmed my son down and got him to lay down. But once Dr. Curtis came in he got scared again. I would get my son calm and laid down but if my son even moved Dr. Curtis would start to get frustrated and tried to be stern with my son. My son is 4 so every time Dr. Curtis would try to talk stern to him  and tell him he couldn\u2019t talk to me, my son just had tears pouring. Dr. Curtis just kept telling my son he needed to talk to him that I was going to have to leave if he wanted to talk to me. So it just made my son scared. Dr. Curtis finally got mad and just said okay it\u2019s not going to work. He can come back and try this again when he\u2019s older and more mature. Didn\u2019t even get the laughing gas on my son. He wasn\u2019t even kicking or screaming. He was just crying and wanted to sit up to be with me. I didn\u2019t want to force my son to do it but I wish Dr. Curtis would\u2019ve handled it better and had more patience and wouldn\u2019t have just stormed out. I\u2019m giving it two stars because all of the women/staff/hygienist are wonderful. They never once got upset and were so sweet to us.

He asked a lot of questions about my baby nursing (kind of awkward to be honest) but my babe had no problems nursing so I still didn't see a need.  He wasn't rude about it,  just very firm in his belief that all children should have full range of tongue (meaning that piece of skin under the tongue should be cut all the way back to the muscle) and this was a necessary procedure. It completely contradicted what our pediatric specialist said when my older child was a baby and needed a little help to latch. I expressed this to Dr. Curtis and he did not agree.  I will say, I was talking with a friend who is now successfully breastfeeding and she credits Dr. Curtis for that.

The low rating is for how the staff and dentist treated myself and my daughter. My 4 1/2 year old does really well with doctor offices and dentist as long as things are explained and she knows what to expect. For instance, she doesn\u2019t cry when she gets a shot because she knows it coming and knows what to expect. I do understand that medical professionals need to do their job and get the information needed. I respect medical personnel and have good relationship with all my providers and my girls\u2019 providers.\nSo why the low rating. For starters the moment we walked in to the examination room, the assistant shoved an iPad in my daughters face without my consent. Again, my daughter is very curious and likes to ask question and know whats going on. During the exam, the assistant kept asking my daughter questions, while she\u2019s watching this show (expecting a 4 year old to multitask, wonderful). My daughter was great during the exam, everything was fine until the X-rays. The staff outright lied and said it wouldn\u2019t hurt. They made me and my youngest daughter leave the room for the x-rays, which i was already uncomfortable with. After the first three x-rays, i hear screams on the last X-ray. I wanted to go in to calm her and help her through it but was not allowed. I saw two more nurses go in and heard more screaming... if i hadn\u2019t had my 1 year old with me i would have burst in there; even now I feel horrible for not doing so. Anyway, after they got the final X-rays the dentist and assistant came back in to check her teeth. Of course she lost trust in them and was freaking out. I was trying to calm her down while they were talking over me and physically restraining my daughter without my consent. I signaled them to back off while i talked to her and calmed her down. We will never return there. I wish I would have just walked in there during the X-rays , grabbed her, and walked out. I DO NOT think it is acceptable in non emergency situations to hold a child down like they did, especially without my consent.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888dc135c41337f:0x6f5e3062ffb2d723"}

We shows up at 12:30 and the door locked before we could even get to the door. We rode around for about an hour and came back. And i have to tell u that I don't like how the receptionist kept rushing my mom and I to make a decission about when to get the work done. Rushing us to hurry up and apply for some type of credit card. Didnt give us much information about the card we are applying for. She swiped my moms debit card and told her if she's approved they would pay for her work to be done and charge a small fee. And its 12 months interest free. But that's it. No more info about this so call credit card. My mom was denied(on purpose) because I did not give all the information required on purpose because i didnt like how she was being treated by this receptionist.  I wasnt comfortable with the way the receptionist was handling my mom at all. It was obvious that my mom couldnt afford 1300plus bucks for a set of dentures and that's with insurance.(im like with insurance and that high? I wonder what its like without insurance then)but that receptionist just kept on trying. Saying pay 600 plus this time to get started and pay another 600 plus next time to cover it. I had just told her my mom gets ssi benefits which is no more than 700 bucks. If i give them 600 plus what the hell about about her bills at home? What bout her food? Etc That receptionist never considered. She never cared. She just kept pressing the issue. And no they never told us the price on the phone. If they had then i would never had wasted my time or my gas bringing my mother to this place. Other than that the place was clean. And quiet.

Because of this my pain threshold is high so if I say something hurts it really hurts. My previous dental office was aware of this yet the hygienist chose to ignore the pain I was experiencing. After speaking with the office manager I decided I would not complete my appointment and later called back and canceled any further treatment with that practice. I called my insurance company and located the office of a previous dentist that I loved and I am so glad I did. I called Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace and even the interaction over the phone was pleasant. Whitney was able to schedule me an appointment quickly and educated me on the processes and procedures and what to expect. I could hear her smile through the phone. The day of my appointment, the entire staff was absolutely wonderful! As a new patient for the practice I knew I would have paperwork and would probably be there for a while but as soon as I finished my paperwork my hygienist was waiting for me. Chelsey greeted me with smiling eyes (she had on her mask), explained the process in depth and after reviewing my x-rays she recommended the best next step to help with my issues. She listened and made sure to understand what I was experiencing and throughout my appointment she made sure the process was not causing too much pain. With tender swollen gums pain is to be expected however if the hygienist knows what they are doing the patient will experience minimal pain. Chelsey knows what she is doing! She took a potentially mouth throbbing, tears running uncomfortable situation and made it a pleasant and educational experience. I went in with my mouth feeling awful and because of what Chelsey did my teeth feel so much better. Because I am a cancer warrior my teeth and gums have gone through some major changes. Chemo, radiation and long term medication has caused damage that I thought was going to take radical treatment to repair but Chelsey explained how to minimize further damage and what to do to get me on a path of recovery. She was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace, you will not be disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621012488256, "text": "Wow to that wonderful review!

They use Transworld System collection agency when Tonya makes a mistake with your treatment plan and tells you your insurance will pay half and you pay the other half ($560) and then it turns out TONYA read it wrong but expects the patient to pay for her mistake you will get turned over to a collection agency! I liked Dr. Bentley and was very disappointed she let her office manager get away with dirty office practices, so I had no other choice but to find another dentist for my son and I. Tonya wouldn\u2019t let me speak to Dr. Bentley she twisted what happened to fit her narrative and let Dr.Bentley think they were doing me a favor by cutting the bill in half when all along Tonya knows this is on her! And she sent a $240 bill to collections on a procedure that wasn\u2019t even done correctly (we were told my son didn\u2019t need a crown turns out he did but because of Tonyas error reading our policy which is her job by the way we never went back to Dr.Bentley after getting a $500 bill in the mail no phone call Tonya knew I would be upset and she knew exactly what she told me) and the tooth had to be extracted after all of that! So NO  I do not recommend you go there! Not because of Dr. Bentley but because you cannot trust Tonya to do your insurance and billing correctly! Do you have an extra $1000.00  laying around when you get a surprise bill from Tonya? When I asked Tonya why she didn\u2019t catch that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover that procedure she said to me well neither did you! Wow!! Tonya claimed to have gotten an approval for the procedure when all along root canals weren\u2019t covered within the first year of coverage (so that was a lie to cover her mistake) I would have thought an office manager and the person who is supposed to verify insurance would check that first thing! I have never had this happen before over 30 years of taking myself and 2 kids to the dentist! So there you have it!

Unfortunately with insurance they always have the disclaimer that it is an estimate and not a guarantee of payment.  As a courtesy we strive to help our patients by handling all the dental billing rather than collecting all payments up front for procedures creating the hassle for the patient to handle all billing to his or her own insurance.  It's a partnership where we rely on what the insurance provides us and what the insurance provides to the patient about their own coverage.

Now Mom's on hospice care at home\nalong with the influx of Covid 19, we had to cancel many appointments.  Well  all the \"planets were in alignment today\" and I actually got her in to get  the denture. Mr. Kym spoke extremely curtly to her and quite frankly. Afterwards quickly , what I felt to dismiss us. Mr. Kym actually wait for it...........sent us home with this  denture only.\nNothing  else. So fast forward as Iam looking at it sitting on my table \"on a napkin\"  I called the office to inquire as to how to care for it. What to put it in (other than her mouth of course) And remembered her telling him that a tooth on top was sharp and causing pain to her tongue. To which he offered NO assistance. Pretty Inept  is the opinion I have of this guys practice.  He also made it quite clear he would offer no  further assistance with her remaining denture situation. You remember, the \" plan\" he had established prior. At any rate  I am simply at a loss.  Mr. Kym, Kim whatever at the very least owes her an apology for the lack of respect that he obviously felt was OK to show towardmy Mom. And at this point,  perhaps he could have one of his assistants  forward His  initial  \" plan \" if you will,  to a DMD whom can assist us in finishing her needs?

I saw Dr. Tan.  When Dr. Tan came and check my teeth and X-ray said I probably just need a cleaning and I had 2 cavities that need filling. They offered to do the cleaning that day and  I was ok with it. I have insurance so I knew that was cover and didn\u2019t have to pay anything. The hygienist also told me I needed a panoramic x ray and that my insurance doesn\u2019t cover so it was going cost me $92 and handed me this paper to sign it . I get very high anxiety at dentist office so I sign it without thinking any of it . She didn\u2019t explain why I needed she just said it was to check if everything was normal . I\u2019ve never had this done so I went with it. Now after my second visit I realized that panoramic x ray  is just a way to get money out of you and just to makes you pay for something you don\u2019t really need . After I got my teeth cleaning dentist never came to check on hygienist work and they never went over the panoramic X-ray . I went go head and got my second appointment to get my \u201c2 fillings\u201d done . The girl at the desk told me it was going to be $116.\n\nI went to my second appointment and of course I was anxious. The dental assistant tells me I need 3 fillings and it was going to cost me $155 . I asked her why 3 since I was told it was only 2 . She said her chart shows 3 fillings. Being anxious and wanting to get this done I just said ok and sign . Got my fillings done and paid . I went home and checked my teeth I can barely see the \u201c3rd\u201d filling . It makes me wonder if I even had 3rd cavity or was this just made up to get more money out of me ? . I don\u2019t know wether there was a miscommunication or if they\u2019re really just dishonest and taking advantage of people who are anxious ? !!!\n\nI know part of it is my fault for not speaking  up and just sign a paper .

My son is absolutely terrified of the dentist we had a really bad experience and then someone referred us to another dentist and then told us that we needed to be sedated so they referred us to here. Before coming to the office I had told them everything that has happened to my son .They reassured me that everything was going to be okay. That you're in good hands now. There was some paperwork that I had to fill out while my son went to head back to take X-rays. One of the paperwork was a behavior problem sheet .I'm not sure what that meant so I asked the nurse what is this paperwork she told me that it was nothing to worry about that before they would sedate him or do anything they would come and get me and talk to me first. The nurse came back out and said that he was doing great everything was going well. So I sat back down after I hand her my paperwork five minutes later my son comes around the corner and he's in tears. This is to be expected because he's so scared. Finished at the paperwork talked about what we needed to do for him forgetting the tooth out and we're walking outside my son looks up to me and says mom please don't bring me back here!! I asked him why what happened he told me that one of the nurses held his hand down and told him if he doesn't calm down there taking him to the back room!! What the hell is the back room?????\nI pulled back the front and I asked the nurse to come outside to talk to me the nurse told me that she was going to have someone call me and talk to me. I called back 30 minutes later after I calm down and ask them what was going on and WHAT is the back room?!? She told me that it was nothing to be afraid of it's just a room that they take children that do not cooperate. So the other kids would not be afraid.\nFirst off you do not threaten kids that are already petrified this is definitely an unappropriate dentist office and we will never be back.

She finished the kids by 2:05pm and just needed the kids checked by the dentist. Dr. Bowman finished with a young patient and then saw a friend and had lengthy personal conversation of 5 minutes with a patient/ friend. I tried to be patient but really became frustrated when the conversation was regarding their vacation to the beach. Finally I asked if the hygienist could intervene & let her know I needed her to go ahead and look at them.  She attempted but Dr. Bowman passed us to go to the patients on the opposite side  of us. I was told by the hygienist we were next to be seen beforehand and this was upsetting to me.  I told her we would just go on because I had an appointment. The hygienist went to let her know we needed to leave again and she refused to come over and directed to get Dr. Bishop to come over to look at the kids. Dr. Bishop  was quick and addressed that one of my kids needed treatment. She was kind and accommodating. Later I called back to set the follow up to have my daughters cavities filled with them and requested Dr. Bishop  and was told they couldn\u2019t accommodate that because of how they saw patients. I voiced that made me consider changing dentists altogether because I did not have a good experience with Dr. Bowman and detailed briefly what happened. The receptionist said in a ugly, smarty tone, \u201cShe would be happy to send her xrays elsewhere.\u201d I said, \u201cI am sure you would, you clearly don\u2019t care how she treated us.\u201d  She said in a hateful tone, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I am thinking.\u201d  So I just rescheduled the appointment and hung up. Kelly called back to inform me that Dr. Bowman was unaware that we needed to leave for another appointment and that she would never treat someone like I described above.  Then she said this was Dr. Bowman\u2019s practice and that I needed to find someone else to provide dental care.  I politely agreed.\n\nI have never been asked to leave a practice, I never yelled or cussed I just stated I had a poor experience and preferred one of the other dentists going forward when scheduling my appointment.  There had been no issues prior to this day. The receptionist Kelly was rude and basically told me the things I said were not true and that it didn\u2019t happen.  I think if I had been the dentist and learned there was a patient issue I might would have called the patient family to seek to understand what happened and try to make it right. But instead no apology and was asked to leave because I wanted one of the other dentists to take care of our children.  I didn\u2019t want to change dental facilities at that point because she needed immediate care.  Initially they scheduled her 5 weeks out to fill 3 cavities. I thought that seemed a little long for dental care and kind of felt Kelly did that to get me to go elsewhere. I didn\u2019t say anything about it so she called back within an hour to request for us to find a different dentist office.  I have a new dentist 5 star rated who scheduled us for a dental care appointment next .\n\nIf I could communicate one thing in all of this an apology would have gone a long way from the Dentist and the receptionist could have worked to orchestrate been an advocate for this but instead was rude and a catalyst to her losing a client.  I guess they do not value my business maybe because they have too many clients.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3bdfae4c8189:0xc855a4af9521f273"}

My daughter was really nervous but the staff was VERY welcoming and friendly. The dentist comforted her. I was blown away by how patient and gentle she was. I was highly impressed. The atmosphere is one that kids will love. The employee in my photo was the dental hygienist. She was cleaning my daughter's teeth. She was super friendly, as well. From the receptionists, to the dental hygienist, to the dentist, I couldn't speak more highly of them. I was mistaken about my daughter's appointment but the receptionist kindly worked her in. I'm sure they couldn't do that every time but, she checked to see if it would work out that day and thankfully, it did! They gave her a fun bag with a little Disney toothbrush, kid's toothpaste and dental floss. The first visit, on the way out, they gifted her a slap bracelet and she received a scrunchie on the second visit. She had to have sealants and a cavity filled so they gave her a sugar free ice pop, that we have since started buying! I HIGHLY recommend this pediatric dentist office to any kid around!

We were told the teeth they needed removed were attached to the bone and a little more difficult to remove prior to our visit- but Dr.Vann removed them without any issue and the girls were not, and still are not in any pain.

I recently cracked a tooth, and I was referred to a local dentist, so I decided to give them a try. Folks, just because someone has a fancy office does not mean that they are a reputable business, at least in my experience. It is not typical of me bad mouthing a local business and I will keep their name out of this review, but they are an embarrassment to the noble profession of dentistry. When I was seen by the hygienist, she responded, \"Oh wow that is bad, you will need to have that tooth extracted immediately\". My initial thought was \"I didn't realize that a hygienist was also a doctor of dentistry\". Then when the dental assistant took the x-rays, her response was identical! What made matters worse the doctor backed up what they said and wanted to extract the tooth right there and then!!! I was concerned and confused so I asked what the cost would be. They brought in the \"closer\" with the three options. Just yank it, yank it and create a cap with a bridge like a denture or the option that I would probably have chosen, yank it and have an implant which would have cost over three thousand dollars, oh, by the way they have a company that will finance.\nThanks, but no thanks!\nSo, I walked out and I waited, maybe too long because I got a bad abscess. Now what do I do?\nI researched and talked to many folks. I decided to give Southern dentistry a try and thank God I did. They got me in the next morning. Everyone that I came in contact with was very professional and friendly. From the receptionist to the dentist. The dental assistant took the x-ray and told me that the doctor will be with me shortly. Most of my experiences with doctors or dentists are that if you have an appointment be prepared to wait an hour or two before someone sees you. I was seen within a few minutes. Dr. Jessica Robinson was great, very professional and to the point and explained everything in detail. She recommended against extracting the tooth. She believed that the tooth can be saved. Her recommendation was to perform a root canal with a crown at a cost of less than a third of what the other dentist recommended! Very short and to the point treatment plan. NO FINANCING NEEDED!\nHow refreshing and what a great place. For once a dentist that understands CUSTOMER SERVICE! I highly recommend Southern dentistry. You will not be disappointed.\nRAVING FAN", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626896010651, "text": "Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a42208bd7a8c1:0x31556a24d6a98934"}

{"user_id": "112224890650932522378", "name": "Alyssa Stellmaker", "time": 1624936690983, "rating": 3.0, "text": "This review is in response to a request sent to me after a dental procedure and included a side note that a review of less than 5-stars should be called into the office rather than placed online.  Dealing directly with the office was unresponsive. I\u2019ve been a patient at Southern Dentistry, with Dr. Nebrig, for 3+ years, with numerous procedures performed. I don\u2019t expect perfection; but, when a business won\u2019t/can\u2019t get you in to see the dentist for pain related to work that he performed and waiting too long could cause further or more serious damage, those little, previously forgiven imperfections compound.\n\nCons:  scheduling and communication.  Can\u2019t get in to see a dentist; even as an established patient, for a dental emergency, or to get a newly placed crown adjusted. If there is a problem with dental work that was completed there-such as a crown that\u2019s too high, pain/possible tooth infection/root canal needed after dental repair 3 weeks prior but persistent pain when chewing, the office will, literally, tell you that they are \u201ctoo busy\u201d to see you. You have to schedule a regular appt, which is many months out.  Neither pain, facial bruising, nor new pain at the contact tooth will matter. One of the assistants who places crowns will ignore a patient\u2019s cry of pain in hopes of rapidly finishing the crown fitting on a raw tooth. When the crown felt a little high during it\u2019s placement, the assistant didn\u2019t dry the tooth before using the chalk paper and told me to wait until I wasn\u2019t numb and to give the teeth time to adjust; they\u2019d move around a bit and I could easily come back in to get it adjusted. The amalgam fillings have a rough/sandy texture that leaves the tooth constantly feeling dirty.   The wait time before work/cleaning begins is often 45-60 min.  If insurance covers at 50%, you overpay before the work is done at a 40% coverage. This policy is left to the patient to discover. When questioning the math for the estimates and lack of refunds or j completed work, they say they will reimburse the difference after all the insurance claims have paid.  After all of the work that\u2019s been done, I\u2019m aware of only one reimbursement.  Perhaps, the overpayments were applied to other procedures and they forgot to tell me. My insurance claims for one procedure showed that I had overpaid Southern Dentistry by something like $86 and the front office confirmed the same amount a couple months after the claim. When I was at my next procedure and asked to have that $86 reimbursement applied to the current procedure, the office said I had $8 owed to me and my \u201cinsurance must not have paid fully for an X-ray or something.\u201d  (They didn\u2019t apply the $8 toward the current procedure or give me the money back.) Providing patients with a break down receipt that shows the portions the patient and insurance paid, and the refund owed to the patient would enhance trust and clarity.  At one appt, the office was in such a hurry to get patients out the door that they skipped my annual X-rays and said they would do them at the next cleaning, in 6 months.\n\nPros:  Dr. Nebrig has a charismatic and laid back, jubilant personality. He does a great job numbing the area that will receive work and calming an anxious patient.  He takes pride in and enjoys his work, and completes the procedures quickly.  Same day crowns drastically improve an unpleasant and time consuming dental procedure.  The office location is convenient. Silver fillings aren\u2019t used.  The hygienists, assistants, and dentist are friendly and gentle.  The sport-top water bottles provided  after a procedure exemplifies attention to detail and patient needs. The facility is clean. The office accepts a lot of different insurances. The business wants patient feedback.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626896853017, "text": "Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a42208bd7a8c1:0x31556a24d6a98934"}

I was a little upset that I had to call to reschedule my appointment, originally for 4/6, (due to COVID)... I guess I just thought that the patients in pain, would at least get a call FIRST to reschedule any important procedures - that didn't happen. Thankfully, I called in late April & was able to get an appt for today, 5/27. I get there at 10:20, my appointment time, let them know I'm there, only to be told, \"You're appointment is scheduled for 11:10\". This was due some type of system issue they were having (understandable, not their fault). BEFORE they take payment, she goes over what they are doing today + how much it would cost. I immediately asked if that price included the nitrous oxide gas (my cost $50). She said no and amended my new payment to include the gas. After waiting for way longer than usual, I was called in and told, \"I'm sorry, the truck hasn't delivered the oxygen\".\nYes, I had about 2-3 panick/anxiety attacks in the chair but after 2 hours of crying, it isfis .... for now.\nNow, I'm in lots of pain and I can't even begin to describe it ... I can't open my mouth + chewing is OUT of the Question!!!!\nI really hope Dr. Nebrig and his staff makes this right bc I thought I FINALLY found a dentist that I can trust + does good work at good prices.\n***********************************************\n(August 2019) Dr. Nebrig and his staff are MARVELOUS. The environment is very relaxing. I was called back as soon as I arrived (literally no wait time in the lobby - not used to such a quick call back once I check in at other facilities I've visited in the past \ud83d\ude43). I was greeted with smiling faces and just felt \"Welcomed\". The girls were the most amazing assistants with my VERY FIRST root canal! They went over + above to ensure I was in as little discomfort as possible. Sidney even brought me a blanket while I waited on my crown to be delivered. Dr. Nebrig has an amazing bedside manner and is very kind and considerate. The staff called me the next morning to check and see how I was doing.

As you have experienced in the past, that is very unusual.  I was in our other office when this occurred and as soon as I read your note I inquired about the event.  It seems that it was miscommunication between the hygienists and your daughter.  Rhonda was scheduled to see her, but was spending a lot of time reviewing a complicated treatment plan with her patient.  Faye had a cancelation at that time, and volunteered to see your daughter instead (to try to avoid any longer delays).  The \"argument\" was regarding whether Rhonda needed Faye to help her out or if Rhonda could see her just a little later.  The effort was to get to your daughter as soon as possible, not trying to avoid her.  I'm sorry that it did not come across that way.  Thank you for bringing this to my attention.  All feedback helps us to become a better office.  Dr. Michael Nebrig, DMD"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a42208bd7a8c1:0x31556a24d6a98934"}

Dr. Scott seemed very helpful the first visit and told me I had a wisdom tooth that had a cavity, the root was short and he could pop it out.  I agreed that when I came back for my cleaning, he could extract it. (Mind you, I had no pain from that tooth nor was it bothering me at all.) I went back for the cleaning/extraction and after a couple of tries, he couldn't pull it.  So he offered to fill it.  I asked if that would fix it and he said yes.  I agreed and paid for the filling.  That afternoon when the lidocaine wore off, I was crying in pain.  I couldn't sleep and could only get a small amount of relief for about an hour by taking ibuprofen and pain medication.  That was on Thursday and they were closed Friday. I called back on Monday and asked if Dr. Scott could see me because I was in terrible pain from the failed extraction.  I was offered an appointment the next day.  Later that morning, I was called and told there was an appointment available that day, when I agreed to take it, the lady asked if it was for a toothache only.  I told her no, explained the situation and she put me on hold.  A couple minutes later she came back and said Dr. Scott said there's nothing else he can do for you, you need to go to an oral surgeon.  She gave me the number to the surgeon, needless to say I have to have it surgically removed and a bone graft done as well.  I don't see why Dr. Scott couldn't have at least seen me to see if there was another issue that was caused by the failed extraction or to see why I am in so much pain.   I wish he hadn't tried to extract the tooth, especially when the root was curved and not able to be pulled.  I was so disappointed.

I was willing to wait in the hall with the door open so that I would not disrupt the procedure but they wouldnt allow it. They also wanted me to sign a form allowing them to strap her to a papoose board and I refused. I have worked in a dentist office and witnessed first hand the methods they use to restrain children and I wont allow it. There are other ways. I had changed to this office because it was more convenient and close to my home, but I will be taking my children back to Smiles in Oneonta where the dentist allows parents to watch children from a distance. Things are different today than they were before and you have to watch your children more closely. Please do not leave your child alone with anyone that you dont know, even if its a dentist or doctor! To add to this, this dentist said 3 of my children had cavities and that 1 even needed root canals. I could not see the cavities so I took my children to Dr. Hypes and NONE of my 4 children need fillings ESPECIALLY not my 3 year old! Some dentists will take advantage of Medicaid patients and perform unnecessary work just to get easy money from Medicaid. Its sickening!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889bd8f8befe09b:0xfa29a404c6a25d13"}

My 3 kids had an appointment for 7:30, 8:00 and 9:00 on May 25th 2021. I was told to arrive on time or they won't be seen. I arrived at 7:15 and  when I arrived I realized they don't even open until 8:00. After they opened, I was attempting to sign in and I was told my kids aren't scheduled to come in today because a (dishonest) staff member decided to reschedule their appointment (without my knowledge) to August for whatever reason, then pretended they tried to call me and left so called messages. No phone calls or messages was ever received. The receptionist gave me paperwork to fill out since she claimed people supposedly cancelled while I was there and that my kids will be able to fill the cancelled spots. Well I filled out paperwork and still sat their 3 hours. They only saw one of my kids. After sitting for 3 hours I decided to leave but they kept the paperwork that I filled out for all 3 kids so I guess they will pretend they saw all of my kids but I plan to notify medicaid just in case fraud is attempted by this dishonest office. I even tried to reschedule my other 2 kids and I was told they won't be able to see them until December!!! I would not recommend this Dentist office at all. The staff (everyone that works in the front office) is rude, dishonest and have no care for your needs or frustration that THEY cause. The supervisor is the worst! Don't waste your time going to her with a problem. She doesn't care or try to resolve any issues.

It\u2019s the beginning of March, how can a location with 2 drs not have an appt or opening for 3months? That\u2019s ridiculous, I called Enterprise and the appt was supposed to be for today and they had us down for the 22nd of March, but the girl apologized even though wasn\u2019t her fault and she said you can go ahead and come on in we can still see you. Wow, the place that only has one dr. Can still see us even though they didn\u2019t have an appt for us today it wasn\u2019t for several weeks.

Two hours later they call me back to day they can't see one child because she has a scratch on her cheek. Then ask what I think, and do I think she should see my child. So she gave me the choice and I chose for her to continue and clean my child's teeth. Then she says that she refuses to because she's afraid it's something contagious from the playground. I say well what could it be? It's a scratch! She says well I don't know the name of it but it's passed around at school from touching. I asked was it impetigo she was referring to (me being a nurse) and she says no I'm unsure. So child one is refused. Child two is back another hour and comes out to tell me they didn't even clean his teeth. They fixed a tooth, that I was unaware needed fixing.

I made an appointment for today to get a cleaning and I even made an extra trip before my appointment time for them to verify my insurance and I was told yes they take it. My insurance pays up to $1500.00 per year for dental. I get to my appointment and after waiting 35 minutes past my appointment time they take me back and do the x-ray then put in another room where a woman comes in and does a very brief look around my mouth and I am told I have no cavities but I do have a very bad build up on my teeth which is true. They also say I have mild periodontal disease which is probably true also but here is were it gets crazy. The tell I am going to see another woman to tell me what it will cost me. I said it shouldn't cost me anything my insurance pays up to $1500.00 to which they reply that the insurance will only cover a normal cleaning and since I need a deep cleaning I have to pay. Then they proceed to tell me that even with my insurance my cost for a deep cleaning will be anywhere from $2000.00 to $3500.00 I told them no way and that I thought they were crooks and walked out. After I left I did a Google search for what it should cost to have a deep cleaning done and it comes back the it should cost between $750.00 and $1200.00 meaning my insurance should have covered it. Now I have no idea how much they are gonna bill my insurance for what they did but I would bet it will take a huge chunk out of my $1500.00 of coverage so when I find a reputable dentist I now won't have the full amount available for that dentist.

Im 40 years old and have been going to the dentist every 6 months of my entire life and I have never had such an \"unfeeling\" dental experience.\n\nI have no dentures, partials, cavities and still felt like I was put through the ringer. I was not hurt, prodded, ridiculed or demeaned in anyway but I did not feel safe, comfortable or appreciated. I will not come back and I would never recommend Aspen. That being said I did get xrays and the dentist came in for a few moments to look in my mouth to verify I didnt have anything wrong. I am going back tomorrow to sign a HIPPA release to have the records and the xrays (I paid for!) released in 7-10 business day to the new dentist I chose over Aspen. Sigh.\n\nI also was recommended a procedure that is not and was not necessary, i refused the chemical prescription strength mouthwash and denied the procedure but was told because I did not accept the (unnecessary debridement) gingivitis procedure that they would not clean (polish) my teeth. Appauled! I wish I could upload pictures of my teeth right now, they are perfect, gums and all. Im sorry but if I dont want to give $100 dollars out of pocket for an optional treatment I shouldn't have too.\n\nMe, myself, and my cavity-less mouth won't ever be back and it would take hell or highwater to ever recommend them for anything other then ripping someones teeth out...which I heard one of their dentist talking about while I was there, I shuttered. Ever see the little shop of horrors dentist?!\n\nAspen, I get it youre a chain but going to the dentist sucks for everyone...find your roots, try not to be the Walmart of dentistry and Aspen if you do choose to become a WallyWorld, lower your prices for sh*t we dont need.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618507524401, "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that, Pelles.

When I arrived at the office they checked me in on the phone in the parking lot in adherence to social distancing during this pandemic. They got me in after an extended wait. But bear in mind this was an emergency appt. Once inside they took a full set of xrays. The dentist came in and discussed the options with me all of which included the extraction of the tooth that had cause so much pain over the last few days. I met with the office manager, paid for the extraction, and went back to wait on the dentist to perform the extraction . I was moved to a procedure suite and the extraction was preformed under local anesthesia. I was released about 20 mins later. I was at the office almost 4 hours but again this was an emergency appt. I returned home and continue antibiotics prescribed by the emergency room 48 hours earlier. The swelling in my jaw and face is slowly going down. The pain is being controlled well with tylenol and advil. Give the fact that they made the emergency appt on Saturday for the first thing available and that I had to drive 40 miles to the office, I was grateful to get the appt as even emergency appointments during the pandemic are hard to get. The experience overall was positive and the staff was very friendly and professional. Thank you a gain for your help with this very painful and unexpected event. I will use aspen dental locally as a dental provider and recommend then to anyone whether having a dental crisis or for routine dental care. The treatment plan and cost are explained up front. They offer third party financing should you need it which could have been a viable option had it been necessary. Thanks again Aspen Dental. Great customer service and great dental service. The cost to get the tooth removed that had caused me such agony for days was $134. Fortunately I had the money to pay for the services. I highly recommend their services.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602155780120, "text": "I'm so glad that the team was able to accommodate you, Keith.

Most of the other dentists I contacted had about a 3 to 4 week wait. The day I arrived they provided me with x-rays and a quick inspection which included reading a bunch of numbers that were above 5 when they measured my teeth. Shortly thereafter they informed me I needed a deep cleaning procedure and a bunch of other treatments. Of course this procedure was going to be over $1,000 out of my own pocket. It was not covered by my insurance. They also informed me of a cavity that would need a root canal and it would be a separate procedure at an endodontist they recommended that of course would be more. They then tried to get me to go into a small room and sign paperwork to pay for the procedure. I left and figured I would get a second opinion.\n\nI decided to wait and made an appointment with Complete Family Dental also in Phenix City. They were able to do a cleaning for me and also fix my cavity tooth with a filling rather than a root canal and Crown. My insurance also covered almost all of the procedures and total cost out of pocket was only $150.\n\nAlso there was no deep cleaning procedure necessary and the numbers they read when measuring my teeth were all three or less.\n\nIt should be noted that I did not inform Complete Family Dental that I had visited Aspen. I wanted to see what they would say to make sure I wasn't being ripped off and if I indeed needed a deep cleaning procedure or a root canal.  Furthermore the dentist at Complete Family Dentistry fixed another filling free of charge because he noticed some decay building up behind that filling on the same tooth he was fixing already. I had my tooth fixed just this week. Definitely worth the wait.\n\nI recommend getting a second opinion if Aspen tries to get you for their 'deep cleaning' procedures.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccfcb1912be09:0xbb0a473fcae18582"}

I'm 38 and retiring out the army. So I've had plenty of dentist experiences over the years. First off it's a brand new facility. Yet some how when you walk in you get hit with a horrible smell. Once you get past the smell it wssnt to bad until they wanted 18 xrays of my teeth. Okay not to bad of a idea so they can see everything. Except you will have to listen to the ridiculous joke that the xray tech has patients drool over her all the time. Ok it's a joke I'm ok with that except I had to hear it multiple times. Along with other jokes and comebacks that you may be thinking in your head right now. Then I have to question  how sterile the equipment is. Like I said I had to get 18 xrays. So I had to bit the tools to do so while sitting in a computer chair. There is a plastic sleeve to cover the exposed parts except the metal they want you to bit down on. Then I move to a room and the actual dental experience not so bad and quick. 10 mins to check for cavities. 10 minutes to check my gums. That might be kinda long it was actually very quick. Then I had to sit there and wait for some new employment paper work as I realize I watched 2 episode of daytime TV. I havent seen anyone in a long time. I start to ask my wife via text I wonder if they forgot about me. I go look for someone and finally ask of I'm waiting on something still. I'm told I'm waiting on the facility manager. Who is with a patient hmm. 20 minutes later I get called to their office asked if I had any questions. Then was like no but this was ridiculous and I'll never come back I've been here 2 hours for a check up that i had a appointment for. They said ok thank you. So not even a apology that their service took so long. So I would not recommend this facility to anyone unless you feel like wasting your entire day. Now it's not like it was a ton of paper work it was all filled out it just needed a signature. Which was signed by the dentist when they completed the exam. So I'm not even sure what the facility manager had to do. But if that is the level of management at a new facility they need a new manager immediately.

I'm not one to write bad reviews on businesses but, I think someone needs to say something about this place.\n\nI went to Aspen Dental in Madison with a brown spot on my tooth thinking it was a cavity. I went through their free exam and X-rays. They found that I had periodontal disease as well, which did turn out to be true.\n\nThe dentist, either inexperienced or dishonest, told me that my \"cavity\" was too close to the gum line to drill and that I would need to have a crown put on (roughly $1,200). She also recommended about $6,000 worth of other work.\n\nI have no insurance and the financing person couldn't work with me due to my low income. I left depressed thinking that my mouth was really messed up and that I needed more work than I could ever afford. Thankfully, I got a second opinion.\n\nThe second dentist I went to took an X-ray, and looked at my tooth. He informed me that I did have periodontal disease and needed a deep cleaning but, that the brown spot that \"Doctor A\" wanted to put a $1,200 crown on was not a cavity or even decay. I had my first deep cleaning session and the spot (\"cavity\") came right off. Again, I'm not dentist but, I'm pretty sure cavities don't just come off.\n\nI thought about just letting this go and not saying anything about it but, I wonder how many people have been screwed over by this business.\n\nMy thoughts are that Madison is a fairly wealthy city and most people have insurance or the money for dental work so, they take the recomendations of an \"expert\" without a second thought. It makes me wonder how many people's mouths and wallets have been ruined by this office. This Madison office has good reviews but, if you look around online, the chain is poorly rated all over the country.\n\nI do not recommend Aspen Dental in Madison.

The person on the phone said I don't know how that works... Really because you would think that when you advertise something your staff would know about it.

From the moment your name is called until you exit the front door someone in that building is trying to sell you something. I had 4 different people try to sell me a $200 toothbrush with a $30 mail in rebate. Both the hygenist and dentist were talking and selling other dental procedures but did not discuss what I came in for.\n\nI went to Aspen Dental for tooth pain and wanted the tooth extracted. I asked before making the appointment if this was a type of procedure they'd do. They said yes. So I made an appointment. I showed up and everyone had a fake plastic smile as if we were playing We Happy Few (Google it). I felt so out of place. When I was finally seen the dental hygenist looked at my teeth for about 10 to 15 minutes then spent 30 to 45 minutes talking about how deep of a cleaning I needed, how much everything was going to cost, how important doing that there was, then pushed how they could do it now and it was only $93 (which I found out later was NOT true. It was in total $186). I declined and mentioned my pain and tooth extraction. She brought up that tooth brush and rebate and I had to listen to another 10 minute talk. Then the dentist came in. Another 10 minutes of poking and proding my teeth with a huge fake We Happy Few smile followed by a 45 minute conversation about MORE treatments I needed and AGAIN WITH THE DANG TOOTHBRUSH! I mentioned my tooth and pain again and she replied with \"Oh no I have to refer you to an oral surgeon. Sorry.\" Why couldn't you just say that!? Why did you have to talk for over 30 minutes about all this other junk while Im sitting there nearly in tears from pain as you sell?\n\nNow, let's talk billing. After all those sales pitches you're sent to billing where someone talks forever about payment plans and the debt you have in dental work. Mind you, NONE OF THIS COVERED WHY I WAS THERE! They hardly wanted to talk about my pain or the extraction I asked for. Just how they wanna fill and clean and polish all my other teeth. I felt trapped. Not to mention they \"referred me\" to someone in Birmingham with the billing guy \"texting him and taking pics of my xrays\". Felt VERY under the table black market because I asked twice for his information and both times I was told \"Oh if you want an appointment we can do it for you and text you the way to get there and stuff.\" Wouldnt even tell me his name or phone number. VERY sketchy.\n\nLater on, I felt uncomfortable about this \"Birmingham guy\" and the $350 extraction he wanted to do and how he wanted to use gas, which I did not want because Ive heard bad horror stories about it, so I asked for them to send me my xrays because I wanted to show them to my local dentist. That's when the real moods kicked in. The friendly atmosphere was gone. They wanted no part in sharing my medical records with myself. Before they were \"willing to send them anywhere\" and were texting them to strangers I didnt even know! Now they decline. I was told if I wanted them I had to go get them or I could just go get new xrays. I told them I did not want to be exposed to radiation again for no logical reason so I would go get them. So I did. Drove 40 min back and was given ONE of my twelve or so xrays. ONE! No fake smiles or sales pitches this time though! Just a lot of eye rolling and weird stares.\n\nIn conclusion, they are so happy to get you in there and they flood you with information and dental work with very little processing time. Now, Im not afraid of dentists but this place got me nervous and scared. It wasnt the physical look of the place. It wasn't rude treatment. It was the huge fake smiles and how the whole time you felt like a cash cow they just wanted to milk for money.\n\nTL;DR: All fake smiles and the entire process was a sales pitch, didn't care for my actual problem. Just wanted to sell me $1800 in dental work that had nothing to do with my original issue and a $200 tooth brush. Very reluctant to give me my own records and made the process a hassle.

You are kept fully aware through every single step of the procedures so much that they are actually teaching you about your teeth. You are encouraged to ask questions along the way so you can fully understand and deepen your learning for proactive care in the future. Rhonda was fantastic at facilitating this. A valuable asset for sure.\n\nThe facility itself is nothing less than cutting edge. So cutting edge that in every attempt they will reduce the total amount of visits and time spent in the chair in total (as they understand going to the dentist is not typically the top of the list for most people). There\u2019s even a screen on the ceiling so, if you wish to, you can watch and see everything that is happening while they explain it.\n\nIt is like being at a 5* hotel- but at a dentist. Not sure I could ever imagine an oxymoron such as this, but Dr. MacBeth and his team have accomplished this. Thank you, congrats, and keep up the great work!\n\n- update 10/4/19\n\nThese guys are not only the best, but consistent! Kathy was always smiling and positive at the at the front desk and made sure everything was totally understood so far as billing and working with the insurance.\nIt was great to catch up with Rhonda again who is so personable and professional in what she does.

He listened to my concerns, looked into some information for me, and even helped me find some other care providers for some of my issues. I really felt like he cared to inform me about everything that was going on, what I would need to have done, and why certain options were better than others. In short, I feel like he went above and beyond what I generally expect from most health care providers. Dr. Parks was nothing short of amazing with his injection of anesthetic. I actually wondered if anything was happening while I was being injected with the stuff. It didn't hurt one bit. I don't know very much about anesthetic injections, so I can't guarantee all injections were made the same, but Dr. Parks is really good at making it not hurt.

I was leary because they let me know that, due to covid, I could not go in with myself then 4 year old. I prepared him and he understood why mom couldn't come in with him. I became more leary when we arrived. The office is dilapidated from the outside. I called to let them know I had arrived and a \"nurse\" comes out and instructs me to move closer to the front of the building although I could see the front door and probably would only save her 6 steps. The \"nurse\" goes inside and I have to call again and wait for her to come back outside. I'm given paperwork and have to call again. Once they come to get my son, the \"nurse\" couldn't understand that she'd have to open the door for a 4 year old (normally he'd hop out but he doesn't know this lady or this building). My son was in there 20 minutes and I was given no explanation as to what was done or the condition of his teeth. I tried to get him to tell me but it's hard to get detail from a 4 year old.\n\nWeeks later I get an invoice for a routine cleaning (keep in mind my husband, oldest son and I have already gotten routine cleanings completely covered & I've checked my benefits). I have had to call twice and haven't gotten a response yet because billing is handled out of my TN.

He assured me they would respect my feelings and no one would make me feel bad for my teeth... I can honestly say he is a man of his word! The dentist & the lady that did my ex rays were so kind to me. I couldn\u2019t have asked for better people to be in my corner!

I have been hurting. They did the xrays and exam. We went over the cost of my options. One over 8,000 and one to get them pulled over 1,000. They wanted me to get a deep clean before any work was done too that's 265 I think. So this was on Thursday and around Tuesday one of the teeth started hurting so bad ...I can't eat...hard to drink anything. The pain is very bad. I called on Thursday I told them what was going on ...ask if they could at least for now pull it. I could pay for it. I would worry about the others later when my insurance will pay. I was told they couldn't work me in until the 24th now this is the 6...so I said I can't wait that long I am in serve pain. She told me that's best they could do.I said what am I suppose to do? They told me to go to the ER or call around. NOW IS THE WAY THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE ME? NO THIS IS SO WRONG. I GUESS MY CASH ISNT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM. I HAD 3 PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO GO THERE AND ASK ME ABOUT THEM I TOLD THEM DONT GO THERE....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER TO MAIN OFFICE. THIS IS DISCRIMINATION IN MY EYES.

Very pleased that I was able to get in three weeks ahead of when I had initially scheduled on the 28th, but not so pleased about the wait. I also liked how I was able to come in later rather than first thing in the morning. I read the other reviews before posting this and do not understand the last review about Mrs. Jessica having an awful attitude. She went above and beyond to make me comfortable with bringing me water, helping fill out paperwork on the Apple as I forgot my glasses, and even getting me a blanket once we were in the room as they keep it frigid inside. We had a lovely chat and she even let me show her pictures and made me feel at ease as I told her I have an awful fear of the dentist. I did not like when they took my xray as they kept jamming it into my mouth and the girl doing it seemed very annoyed and like she would rather be elsewhere. I heard her talking negative about other patients with another girl in scrubs while she was doing my xrays as well which makes me wonder what they said about me and my silly fears. She left me in the room for over an hour waiting for the dentist, and the girl at the front came and checked on me more than the xray girl in scrubs did. I enjoyed meeting with the hygienist I belive her name was Miranda as she explained everything I needed done and was very understanding about my fears. She even spoke to me about possibly numbing it before she did any work which definitely makes me feel like I found the right place. The dentist Dr. Ebby was very kind and had kind eyes. He seemed to genuinely care and made jokes to make me feel more at ease once we were in the room. I\u2019m sure he has a nice smile but I couldn\u2019t see with the mask on. He was definitely better than my last dentist who didn\u2019t care about people of my age and only want money. He seemed to want to help me get what was best for me and not drain the little savings I have left. When i spoke about the money to man at the end named Austin he was an absolute sweetheart. I have never met someone so understanding and kind, and he even went out of his way to give me more adorable options and let me take up so much of his time just to make sure I would be able to afford what I need. He gave me his personal office number and told me to call him with any questions. I learned later from the front girl he was the office manager and I find it so refreshing that an office manager is willing to spend that much time with a woman like me to make sure I\u2019m taken care of. The level of care I received was unbelievable and I truly feel like I found a place where I am cared for and taken care of financially and healthily.

It is now months later and I have my final dentures. Dr. Abtin Iranmanesh is the consummate professional with a very big heart and compassionate  side. When I first net him, I had been the victim of extreme dental malpractice from another local so-called dental franchise. I was in dire shape. Dr. Iranmanesh 'took me under his wing' and today I am finished with my treatment plan, out of pain and have a beautiful smile. I could not be more pleased with my outcome. Many others in that office have been very kind and helpful as well. When I first started treatment at this office, it was brand new and barely established. I received a lot of personal attention and there was no issue getting the needed appointments. I do miss that part. Their popularity has grown along with the number of patients. That is a great thing for the business but not so for the patients unfortunately. I guess I was spoiled in the beginning.  However, Dr. Iranmanesh has always made sure I was well taken care of and given the best treatment available.

The pain persisted after placing the permanent crown (on the second try, and it still did not look great on the X-ray).  I gave up on you as a dentist after the third or fourth bite-adjustment that did not solve the problem.  On the most recent visit (after my new dentist told me to go back to the person who placed the crown to get it re-done), you said that this crown is \"perfect\" and told me to go to an endodontist.  You also mentioned that you had told me before that the root could be damaged from previous tooth decay - you had not told me this about this specific tooth in the past, only a different tooth on which you had already performed a root canal.  According to the endodontist that did perform a root canal, the roots were in good shape - there is a crack in my tooth underneath the crown, which was the source of pain whenever debris got in the crack and irritated the root.  Whether this crack was because of a poor bite when I first got the crown or something else, I guess I'll never know.\n\nZero Stars: You lied to me.  I am listing several instances here, in no particular order:\n\n1.  As I already mentioned, you did not discuss this tooth and its root with me in the past as you stated at the most recent visit.  The assistant at that visit even looked for it in the chart notes and could not find it .\n\n2.  After the insurance claim for the crown was denied the final time, I asked you about the dentist's narrative on why it was necessary that should have been included in the files that were sent to the insurance.  You said you typed a full page for this, your receptionist said it was a few lines handwritten.  Neither of you could find a copy to provide to me.  When I was filing the appeal to the insurance company a few months prior, I asked if there was a narrative, and was not made aware that such a thing existed.  One or both of you lied directly to my face.\n* If you did not file anything because I was on the \"patient appreciation plan\" which states that you won't file insurance while I'm on it, you could have told me that and I would not have had an issue.  This was why I filed insurance on my own after paying you for the procedure, expecting them to reimburse me the covered percentage of what I paid; admittedly, I did not realize the amount of paperwork and effort needed for this.  Instead your office told me that you did file all the needed paperwork, which the insurance company never received.\n\n3.  I'm not even convinced that this crown was necessary (and there apparently is no narrative to state that it was).  Your office seems to put a higher priority on crowns and other high-dollar work than on fillings, which seems backwards to me as I would think that you would want to do a filling as soon as you find it so the tooth does not get bad enough to need a crown.  Another tooth of mine which you said would need a crown (which I never got from you because the pain on the other side of my mouth never stopped) currently has a filling from my new dentist.\n\n4.  You said an endodontist can remove and save the old crown to place it back on later.  This is incorrect, both endodontists I visited stated that they drill through the crown to perform the root canal.  This may not have been intentional, but I'm counting it as another lie.\n\n5.  After I got the root canal, some porcelain chipped off of another surface of the crown.  I called your office to ask about what material the base metal is (and if I should worry about corrosion) and was told that ALL the crowns you perform are pure zirconium and not porcelain-on-metal.  When I asked how that could be if mine clearly has exposed metal, the person on the phone got quite defensive ... like accusations of lying (perhaps not unfounded) is a common phenomenon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600008293148, "text": "David, I'm sorry you are unhappy. I do hope you at least realize we tried our best to provide all the Care that we could. If you don't mind, as you leave us one star would you mind elaborating on what you wish we had done better? That would be helpful for me and anyone reading this. However, respecting your privacy, I don't want to elaborate on what I think your experience may have been.\n\nUpdate: David, I am so happy that you have found a new dentist with a relationship that you have confidence and Trust in! Thank you for taking the time to share this with me.  It will do neither you nor I any good for me to make a defense of the experiences that we had together. I'll leave it at I am so sorry for the misunderstandings we had and I wish it had gone otherwise.

And I'm not a relative, I swear.\nI live in Austin Texas and was visiting Huntsville and had a dental emergency. My crown post broke and I was left without a front tooth. I went to Dr. Cook for options and after extensive discussion decided to put a new post in and a temporary crown so my dentist at home could then replace the temporary with a new crown. But when Dr Cook got into the process he discovered an old-school resin that had been used  to fill the root canal and determined that the chances of success for a new crown were significantly reduced. Rather than continuing with the new post, he simply glued the old crown back in place and suggested that I discuss my options with my dentist at home. Wow... He had the opportunity to charge me for a new post that probably would have been unsuccessful but instead was honest and told me that I would probably need an implant.\nPatient before profits. For me this is something significant and something I was extremely impressed by. On top of all of that, the office was friendly, extremely organized, and seamless throughout the entire process.

She is even excited to go back for cleanings because it was a great experience for her (awake)\n\nI would recommend them for any pediatric services.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a5ab6fe9677:0x7e2859ca99722eb8"}

He is a really nice guy but seemingly lacks the energy and spirit to meet children where they are emotionally.\n\nOur 5yo daughter has significant anxiety regarding dental appointments. Some of this is due to bad experiences with previous dentists and some due to poorly handled situations by Dr. Bush.\n\nOur daughter initially went in for some routine fillings, however, during the process of proving local anesthetic Dr. Bush actually nicked her lip with the needle. Of course, this brought that attempt at repairing her teeth to a screeching halt. We were advised to have the procedure accomplished at Baptist East in the outpatient surgery.\n\nThis is where our deep displeasure with the process really came to life. Our appointment was the first of the day and we were directed to be at the hospital at 6am. We were told our daughter would get an oral sedative that we would administer to calm her prior to going back with nurses. Instead, since we were first of the day, the anesthesiologist didn\u2019t even mention an oral sedative. We asked Dr. Bush again about that ensuring him our daughter was nervous about the process and he basically blew us off claiming the nurses \u201cdo a really good job\u201d.  Come to find out the sedative takes time to work so the first appointment of the day WILL NEVER get that sedative; parents beware!\n\nWell I can tell you they may have been doing their best but they had to tear my daughter away from me kicking and screaming. There was nothing I could do as the room was already prepped for the procedure.\n\nDr. Bush, in his infinite wisdom of child psychology, was sure our daughter would have \u201cretro amnesia\u201d post-op. Again I can tell you the very first thing out of my daughters mouth was recalling how she did not want to be on the bed the nurses initially put her in. During consultation, Dr. Bush was barely apologetic and completely glossed over the fact that he screwed us due to scheduling/timing while speaking incorrectly on behalf of the anesthesiologist.\n\nI could go on and on about how the entire procedure was a complete and utter cluster. Apparently this is the norm for them, I hope you other parents can avoid a similar experience for your little ones that have anxiety...our daughter will likely have issues with the dentist for the foreseeable future.  But hey they have a dog...\n\nBush Pediatric Dentistry employees do not bother responding to this, that ship has sailed. If we have to go to another city, we will find a dentist that works for us.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a5ab6fe9677:0x7e2859ca99722eb8"}

I'm sticking with Complete Dental from now on and I won't be going back to Aspen that's for sure. I mean Aspen had Dental code d4341 which is periodontal scaling and root planning 4 plus teeth, listed four times for each section of my mouth... I did not need scaling and replanting at all at the other place. Another thing that really made me mad was that the teeth they x-rayed 2 years ago and Aspen dental, there's a bunch of three surface composite d2393 codes listed and at complete dental, none of these teeth were listed as teeth with cavities. I examined my x-ray from both places and Aspen was really trying to charge me for teeth that had no problems. I just don't know why they do that... That makes people not want to return.\n\nComplete Dental listed 10 items on my treatment plan, x-ray taking last month..

They said I needed a special kind of deep cleaning instead of just a normal cleaning which is fine and great until I was informed that the special deep cleaning was going to cost me over me $200! With my dental insurance 2 cleanings and X-rays are included with my dental insurance at no cost to me as preventive care.  When the dentist told me that she wanted me to get a special kind deep cleaning I figured it was covered under one of my cleanings.  I had no idea that particular cleaning was going to cost me over $200.  So when the office manager made me aware that when I came back in for that kind of cleaning I would need to be prepared to pay over $200 because it wasn\u2019t considered preventive care but basic care because it was a deep cleaning.  I told her that wasn\u2019t explained to me an I wanted to change my treatment plan back to just a normal cleaning.  The office manger said that the treatment plan couldn\u2019t be changed without the dentist approval so she went an asked the dentist.  The dentist refused to change the treatment plan to just a normal cleaning.  At first I thought well maybe I am in need of the special kind of deep cleaning until I sought a second opinion from someone in the periodontal field and they informed me that a normal cleaning would suffice just fine.  So, with that being said I feel like they were trying to upsell me especially since they refused to do any kind of cleaning unless I agreed to pay over $200 for the deep clean! I had to make another appointment with another dentist so I could get the care I need.  More of my time spent on something I had already done.  This whole situation stinks and should be unacceptable!  Dental health is so expensive and stuff like this just makes it more difficult!  Aspen Dental and some of the other companies like them have a reputation for this but I was still willing to give them a chance.

After waiting around 30 minutes after receiving x-rays, they came in and informed me that my teeth looked great with ZERO cavities. The lady who cleans teeth came in and looked at my teeth and said that I had some kind of bacteria (I don't know how in the world you can determine by looking at teeth what kind of bacteria they have without placing under a microscope). I said okay when can you clean my teeth? She said she would be right back that she would get it set up. While waiting patiently, I hear her in another room telling someone else they have the same kind of bacteria and would need advance cleaning. After waiting they informed me that my teeth would need an advance cleaning and it would cost $281 to have my teeth cleaned after my insurance (MY INSURANCE COVERS 100% of basic care including cleanings). Basically, for first appointments and cleanings, they tell all of their patients the same thing to try and drag as much money out as possible. After this I was not going to post a review, but I decided to go with another dentist and have called them 5 times to have my x-rays emailed, but they keep insisting that they have emailed them, but have not. They are completely dishonest and are trying to charge almost $300 for a teeth cleaning that shouldn't be over $50-$100. Please save your money and go somewhere else. I asked, \"Can I not just receive a regular teeth cleaning that my insurance company covers?\". They explained company policy that they are not allowed to give regular teeth cleanings for first visits, so basically they lie and tell everyone they have some kind of bacteria.

Dr. Tara Cochran (who will, probably, be my dentist for the rest of my life..I hope), she gave me all the necessary information so that I could make a good choice in my dental plan.

Fast forward and I begin to have issues with the tooth that had the root canal. I call the Decatur office (I now live closer to this location, unfortunately) and specifically ask if they will be able to address an issue that another location serviced. The office manager encourages me to come to their office for the issue. A month goes by and it is the day of my appointment. I call and ask if I may come in early since I finished up with work early. The receptionist puts me on hold to speak with the office manager.(DUM, DUM, DUM...*music fit for a villain begins to play**not really, but it should have*) He begins to say that they can't work on the issue and I would need to visit the Aspen Dental location that completed the root canal. ( If you're reading this Greg, in the future you might want to do your research about your company's policies before wasting another person's time) The office manager goes on to tell me that he called and left a voicemail yesterday to tell me all of this information. And I told him that I didn't have a missed call or voicemail from him. And that I thought it was ironic that the other five calls that we exchanged a month ago were never missing from my phone. Only now that I explain that I am irritated that when I called a month ago he gave me a different answer are his call and voicemail from yesterday \"magically\" absent from my phone. He proceeds to say, \"well I know for a fact that I called and left a voicemail.\" To which I respond, \" I know for a fact that I don't have a missed call or voicemail. He then laughs sarcastically. So I told him, \" since he thought it was appropriate to speak to me that way then I decided to respond in the same manor.\" And the conversation ends with him telling me that they will not ever see me in their office. If I could give zero stars, I would. If he would have just apologized and not smarted off, I would have been understanding. Extremely horrible experience.

I also understand the reason parents are not allowed back in the treatment area. Many times in the morning, the children will cry for their parents to stay when dropped off at school. The longer the parent stays, the more they cry. Within a few minutes after parents leave, they have stopped crying. I feel the best thing a parent can do is to prepare their child for a new experience by telling them something like \"I love you and want you and your teeth to be healthy. I am taking you to the dentist so your teeth can be healthy. I will not be able to go back there with you, but I would never take you to someone who would hurt you.

From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeting with compassion and understanding, and assured that they could fix her crowns.  They immediately scheduled an appoint for that same week to do her evaluation.  In that first appointment, Dr. Wilson laid out exactly what needed to be done, gave us a time frame for the work to be completed with cost estimates, and hand made her a set of temporaries that looked better than any of the final crowns from the other dentists we had worked with.  He performed laser dentistry on her gums to give her a bigger smile, used the KOR whitening system to give her a bright white color to her teeth, and put on two new crowns that he gets from a lab in Hollywood, CA.  I can proudly say today that my wife has a beautiful smile that she is so proud of thanks to the work of Dr. Wilson and his staff at Signature Smiles.

I scheduled my appointment with the dental rep and asked what I could expect. She told me to plan to be there about an hour. They would clean, polish and then give me the Sheer Whitening treatments. Wow, I thought, pretty good prize. I proceeded to ask what kind of whitening treatments they used, 5 day strips, ugh, I thought, oh well.\n\nUnfortunately, I arrived for my appointment about 10 minutes late, however, not intentional. The receptionist was a bit unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because I was late. Shortly, a dental assistant came to me with a clip board and 5 pages to fill out. I completed my basic information and soon realized they were wanting more info than was totally necessary to claim a prize. I began scanning over the pages and stopped immediately. They were asking me everything from signing to consent to pay for the charges they would render to me today and insurance could not be filed to authorizing them to obtain my dental records from my current dentist. I proceeded to the receptionist and told her there was obviously a mistake, I was asked to fill out patient paperwork and that I was only there to redeem my gift certificate. She told me to proceed completing the paperwork so that they could keep it on file. I looked at her in disbelief and sat back down placing the pen under the clip. I guess she signaled the assistant who came out and retrieved my paperwork. I waited for over 30 minutes before they called me back. I followed the assistant back to a dental room and she handed me a box of strips and about 5 minutes of instruction. Do you have any questions? I said, \"Are we done?\", she said yes that's it. Hmm, so they led me to believe that the cleaning and polishing were part of my prize when really they were going to bill me for this when they were finished. I guess I didn't fall for their trap.

Christian, our 10 year old son and 100% all adventurous boy, was riding moving dolly's on our concrete driveway.  He smacked his mouth on the concrete putting a great triangle chip in one of his front teeth. We were stressed trying to find a new dentist. As I was reaching out to friends, family and acquaintances for help Dr. Beitel's name kept frequently coming up. My husband called our pediatrician asking about Dr.Beitel and the staff called back telling us they loved him.  Dr. Beitel's office was so helpful, courteous and caring from the moment I called. They were so very understanding of  the situation we found ourselves in with a retired dentist, our sons accident and no dentist. They got Christian in that morning to see Dr. Beitel. Brandy, the dental assistant was so good and caring with him and really made Christian feel very comfortable. Dr. Caroline Beitel, Dr. Beitle's daughter, was the dentist who took care of Christian. She was very patient and kind with Christian and was able to also repair the tooth that day. Dr. Caroline was courteous toward the support staff and she and Brandy worked together well as a team. They both kept talking and cutting up with Christian. Honestly my son was so happy with them that he kept telling everyone after we left how great those two ladies were. Needless to say my husband and I think they are great and both our sons have found a great new father daughter team who are great with kids. Five stars from us and our son.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621322b8d12b4d:0xd4b222525142f9b2"}

April 28th to ask if my appointment is still scheduled for April 29th,  no one answered, I left message. I received a call back within an hour \u201cAmazing!!  Well the association told me they had no scheduled appointment for me at all and are completely book up.  Not willing to help me at all.. I\u2019m blown away !! I\u2019ve  been waiting we\u2019ll over a month, and half  amdyou have nothing scheduled?!  What kind of business is this?!!!  Aspen Dental is a complete and utter JOKE!!

I would, their not deserving of one star.\n\nI would pay 3x times amount to someone other dental office  than have these clowns touch my mouth.

No, there are no implants included in that work.\nThe only downside was, after having my appointment schedule, the morning of, they sent me a message about coming in a half hour early, to have an unplanned cleaning.  I had recently had a cleaning.  This news about the cleaning the morning of, totally freaked me out, and turned me into a slobbering idiot.

I went to them initially to have an annual checkup and to have a chip/break in my front tooth repaire.  The repair they made looked fine but only  lasted less a few weeks.  Then the dentist recommended that I get a crown.  My tooth was prepared and they took molds of my teeth for the crown and supposedly  did a color match (WRONG).  When the tooth came back it was the wrong color.  But the temporary tooth that was put on in it's place fell out the first day.  No adhesive was applied.  The  doctor left before the temporary was placed in my mouth and the technician who put it in obviously used no glue.  I did not go back for them to glue the temporary (my fault/busy schedule).  I just persevered until the crown came in,  When the first crown came in it was too long and the wrong color.  So it had to be sent back for a color change and to be  shorten.  I received another temporary tooth.   Well the doctor put on another temporary this time and  he really glued it on.  He glued it on with an adhesive that obviously was WRONG for a temporary because they could not easily remove it.  The next dentist I saw had to drill the temporary tooth off.  Then the second crown again was the wrong color (WRONG AGAIN!).  Another temporary was made and put on.   So now I am waiting for the crown (Third time) and hoping it is the right color.  In the meantime the temporary I had fell off while I was eating a salad a few days ago and is broken and can no longer be used to hide the ugly tooth stub.  I have this HIDEOUS gap and STUB of a tooth in the front of my mouth.   I have had so much anxiety regarding this dental situation and no resolution in sight for a few more days. This is not a matter of insurance, nor a matter of money...I have both and have paid in full my co-pay for this procedure.  It is a matter of good dental service of which I have yet to receive.  After the first two disastrous  appointments and having not received a crown that matches and is acceptable I  am very disappointed and disgusted with ASPEN Dental.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43ea0834b16b:0x5e04b49f782ae262"}

But, felt it was important because people so easily post negative vs positive. Dr. Walker and his staff went above and beyond to meet my dental needs. I previously worked as a dental assistant while I was paying my way through college. So, I know a bit more than the average patient. I have to say that Dr Walker is far above average in his skill and chair-side manner. I had to have an extraction of #18. I never felt the injections.  And the actual extraction was done with speed and ease.  I hardly had any bleeding. I have assisted on many ,so I was prepared for the stress and pressure that one typically feels. Experience none of that with Dr. Walker.  A couple weeks later, I lost a significant portion of an old amalgam filling on#32. Yet, another difficult tooth position. Dr Walker was aware that I did not want to extract the tooth.  But, could not afford a crown at that particular time. Therefore, Dr. Walker spent extra time diligently repairing the tooth so that I wouldn't lose it. As previously  stated, it's  been about a year and 3 month and the tooth is still holding steady. Dr Walker is a brilliant Dentist with a kind heart. A combination not often found. Not to mention he makes you feel comfortable. As if you've been friends for years. In sum, He's as good as it gets. Aspen Dental and the Florence/Athens AL area are fortunate to have Dr Walker.  If he moves, I will travel to receive his care.  He took the time to earn my trust and respect.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597439850243, "text": "It's so nice to hear that, Angela.

I raised my brother and sister, cared for my mother who had ovarian cancer, and my husband with lung cancer. I survived cancer after a long hard fight . And when I need help no one will help. Aspen dental gave me the name if a insurance company to buy dental insurance.  Then I still have to come up with thousands. They only want the money. They will not work with you and will not help you. And I desperately needed the help. No money  no help! And I would gave gladly paid the outrageous amount in payments and been very grateful to them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592227893076, "text": "I'm sorry that you didn't have a positive experience.

I experienced horrendous wisdom teeth pain and had put off having them removed because I  have no dental insurance and an extreme anxiety toward needles going into my mouth. The pain got so bad that I ended up in the ER, which resulted in my having no choice but to get them out. I called Aspen Dental and they were so kind and helpful! They allowed me to set up an easy finance plan. They got me an appointment quickly. I had the x rays to be examined and the technician was so helpful by talking to me to make the long process of taking so many pictures go by super fast. I had an initial cleaning with a Mrs. Norma, whose vibrant smile and personality made me feel welcome and calmed my nerves tremendously.  During the cleaning they discovered I had gingivitis and they gave me a full treatment. They helped me get an Oral B toothbrush with Bluetooth capabilities and different modes for brushing and cleaning my teeth on my own. Mrs. Norma took time to give me tips on how to floss better so that I can prevent getting gingivitis again. When it came time to have my surgery, Dr. Perry helped my nerves by telling me what he was doing, when he was doing and why. Dr. Perry took time and didn't rush the process. The dental assistant that day was Mrs. Kourtney. I'll never forget how she kept me calm by reassuring me that I would be fine. She said being nervous was ok and normal. She kept telling me I was doing great. I don't think she knows how much I needed that. She kept my mouth suctioned, which I really liked because I have a tendency to have a gag reflex and that prevented it. Dr. Perry earned my trust and respect especially when he made the decision to divide my surgery in half. He did the left side, then had me wait two weeks for the other because he was concerned about my being able to eat comfortably. When he did the right side, he was assisted by a trainee who was kind also and attentive to my needs. If she continues to do as she did, she will be great! Overall, they really are a great place to go for dental needs. Even though I didn't need to use him, it also felt good knowing they have an oral surgeon with their office too. They will now be my go to for dental work! Thank you Aspen Dental!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581367889410, "text": "I'm happy to hear that you felt comfortable with the team, Mary!

I, personally, have suffered from depression and anxiety for a large part of my life, as well as adolescent gran-mal seizures since I was fifteen years old. The seizures prevent me from being able to drive a car, which prevents me from from being able to get to and from a workplace easily.\nLacking regular funds/insurance coverage, and being anxious and depressed did lead to my neglecting my dental health, which simply exacerbated my anxiety. I suffered a huge panic attack after encountering some (actually relatively minor) dental pain a few days ago. I made an appointment at Aspen Dental for the next morning, which was impressively easy to do online and your staff here at Cox Creek Pkwy did not disappoint me whatsoever; service was extremely professional. Dr. Konradi and the dental hygienist couldn't have done a better job at reassuring me that my shortcomings can be overcome.\nMy blood pressure at the time was apparently extremely high, most likely a result of the panic attack I suffered the night before, compounded by a minor fever and a lack of sleep. I took my blood pressure this morning and it has thankfully returned to a normal level (111 over 76). I have already purchased the recommended electric toothbrush and a new pro-gum-health toothpaste. I have been instilled with a strong sense of hope already and I have no doubt anymore that I am capable of restoring my dental health.

It is a very kind gesture to reach back out to me.\n\nI loved the hygienist 100%. She was very good with my 1 year old and I will go anywhere to be seen by doctors, nurses, etc. that are sweet to my baby but other than that I have mixed emotions. I arrived for my appointment 8 minutes early and walked up to the door to see a paper posted about staying in your vehicle and calling about your arrival. I understand that is typical COVID protocol but I had to wake up my sick daughter to get her out so it was a pain. Not a big deal but they weren\u2019t ready for me. About 20 minutes later they called me to see if the paperwork was complete but they still wasn\u2019t ready for us. I called after 40 minutes to see if they had forgotten about me and they had. Had I known I would wait so long, I could\u2019ve let my daughter sleep. The exam part was overall good (the doctor wasn\u2019t there so there was a stand in). I went to pay and because I don\u2019t have dental insurance they weren\u2019t sure what to charge me, which I found odd. I ended up paying $81 dollars just for them to look inside her mouth. No X-rays no fluoride and no cleaning. Just a five minute look. I don\u2019t know if that is normally what an exam would cost but it seems high. Honestly, after sitting in my car for 40 minutes and then 5 in the chair I am surprised to pay that. The hygienist waited for me and helped me with the doors which I appreciated because I had to hold my little one and carry stuff too. I am willing to go back one more time because of the hygienist but I\u2019m not sure if this will be the place for us long run.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cbb343fbb483:0xfc371336b0beb0e3"}

I was there 30 minutes before my appointment and sent a text (as requested by the office) to let them know I was there.\n\nJada brought out the paperwork I needed to fill out as a new patient and requested I text the office phone number when finished. She took my insurance card and driver\u2019s license to make copies while I filled out the very simple paperwork. The paperwork was basic and took no time at all. I sent a message when I was ready.\n\nShannon was Dr. Rutledge\u2019s assistant. She did my X-ray where the toothache was and talked with me and about my dental history. I was comfortable with her immediately. She explained everything she was going to do before she did it.\n\nDr. Rutledge came in and was INCREDIBLE! He diagnosed what was wrong quickly. I was super surprised to find out I had a cracked tooth! He went over all options with me and we chose the best plan for me. My appointment with him was set up as a consultation only and I was afraid it would be a while before I could get in to have the work done he suggested but boy was I wrong!\n\nCasey is the wonderful lady who is in charge of checking out Dr Rutledge\u2019s patients and she set up my appointment for m, MONDAY, February 15, 2021! I only had to wait four days to have the work done! Casey is a ROCKSTAR!\n\nI will return on Monday, February 15, 2021 to have a crown and possible root canal. I\u2019m not nervous at all.

However, when I first switched to Northcutt, it was because my previous dentist retired.  I was told that a filling I had received needed to be replaced.  I was reluctant, because it wasn't giving me any pain or problems, but I had it replaced.  After the replacement, the dentist said he needed to replace his own work (no charge)  so he did.  Then I started having a lot of pain from the 2nd replacement.  He worked on it a 3rd time.  The last time I went in, he expressed that the whole tooth needed to be crowned - lest I eventually need a full root canal.  (this time charged of course)  Needless to say, I will have to be getting a second opinion.

His front tooth got knocked in and was terribly crooked. Blood was everywhere...\nMy wife was at work..and needless to say..I was a little panicked. My wife came home and we started calling dentists. We came to find out that most dentists are closed on Friday..and it was Thursday evening when this occurred. My son has been a patient at Deerfoot Dental since his teeth really started coming through. We left a message after hours and Dr. Grovestein called us back! He asked us to text him photos of my sons teeth. We sent the pics and he called us back. He reassured us that it probably wasn\u2019t as bad as it seems and he would meet us at his office the next morning. So he opened his clinic for us on his day off! I mean who does that? He gave us instructions to care for the tooth, we made a follow up appointment, and left. Needless to say..our sons tooth looks great. It actually straightened out almost back to its original spot. We went to our follow up appointment and got the good news that his teeth looked great and to just keep a watch on it. I have never in my life experienced customer service from a healthcare provider like this. We are still in shock that someone would care so much about the wellbeing of our son.

The dentist went over my x-rays extremely quick and the exam was maybe 5 minutes. I had to bring up my issues the dentist did not even ask me..

They have my utilization very high on my credit card so until they send Genesys the refund , I can\u2019t do anything. They are a scam. Why would you pay yourself for services in full that a patient never received?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597145200539, "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that, Jaquenti.

My boyfriend received an appointment for June 11th, arrived 15 minutes early, approached the counter and was told his appointment had been canceled. They offered to reschedule and apologized but said there was nothing they could do, as his appointment had been given to someone else. He had done his paperwork by email and had confirmed his appointment as well. This was not an error on his end. Today, I arrived for my appointment after no communication from Aspen\u2019s end for weeks. I approach the door and it is locked with a note saying the office is closed until July 13th. I was turned away by the lady working inside, while two other patients that had approached the front door were taken inside. I was contacted by one of their managers after I called corporate to explain my frustrations with being turned away after having my appointment for over two months now, and I was told that there was no doctor in office. She explained that the other patients were just \u201ctaken inside\u201d and did not elaborate further as to why I wasn\u2019t offered the same efforts.

First the technician who I guess makes the dentures, etc., came in & was able to make an adjustment that would have made them wearable till she had a new set made. When they started to make impressions none of the trays that hold the \"goop\" was small enough to fit in her mouth???? Never had that problem before.\nThey ended up using her dentures to make the impressions, getting the goop all over her, then giving her a towelette to clean up with that came from a container that was clearly marked \"Do not use on skin\".\nWhen we got home & took the bottom denture out of it's baggie, it had been ground down till there was nothing but teeth sitting on a flat base. Called them today to tell them they needed to make her a temporary plate & was told they couldn't do that.  Needless to say we are not going to do business with them.

It was a weird experience at Aspen Dental to be sure, and I cant help but feel as if I was swindled somehow. It was the longest and most expensive dental appointment I've ever had. Being a new patient, I expected extra steps like xrays, but the whole ordeal was weird and confusing from the beginning (starting with when I tried to confirm my appointment via email, which ended up being a phone call, and none of my information was correct in their system). After an awkward xray process, I was led to a room and sat in a chair for about 30 mins. The first obvious red flag that had me wondering if I was getting the wool pulled over my eyes was the TV they stuck in my face (attached to the chair) as the tech and dentist did \"paperwork\" and talked about teeth stuff amongst themselves behind me completely out of my field of vision. Then the dentist said I had gingivitis and two cavities-- which were a complete shock to me since I've never had any in my life and was experiencing nothing unusual in my mouth during my daily life, no pain or discomfort at all. The gingivitis thing I could understand, I guess (i mean it's a reversible condition from what I understand, so I thought it was weird for them to schedule a whole multi appointment treatment process that would take place throughout the month). I dont know anything about teeth, so you could tell me to open up, poke around in there with tools, and tell me it's a whole huge dangerous mess and I'd have to believe you, because what do I know? What I do know is that the visits to my old dentist were always straight forward and I understood everything they were doing because it was clearly explained and they didn't try to schedule 3 visits in a single month. After all that waiting, tv, and a brief examination, I find myself at the cashier's desk and absolutely no work was done on my teeth. I opted out for the 130$ smart brush that was included in my bill. And then they said they could probably fit me in today for my first treatment after I paid for a large sum that was ultimately un-itemized. The paperwork I received was not a receipt for what I paid for in that moment, but a breakdown of all the work they were going to do and how much it was going to cost me later. I agreed to have the first treatment done right away. Finally, I was going to receive some sort of treatment that was physical during this visit, but I didnt truly understand what I was paying for that warranted such a large bill when I was at the cashier's office. The treatment was no different than what any other dentist would do during a routine cleaning so I'm still not sure why it was so expensive. At the end of my visit, I walked away with a lot of fancy products and with the peace of mind that I didnt have mouth cancer...so, that's a relief. The staff was super friendly and kind, and I really appreciated Loretta. She was absolutely fantastic, but I'm not sure I want to go back to this place at least two more times in a single month just to be broke and confused again. I fully understand that I am dumb, but things just didnt add up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570203176746, "text": "Thank you for providing this information.

But I trusted him and he did 2 fillings and the 3rd filling he just put a deep hole in my bottom tooth and sent me home. When I got home I realized there was a big deep open hole in my tooth. So I go back up there to have it filled. The dentist said out loud, \"why did I do that?\" Which lets me know he messed up. While he was sticking needles in my mouth to numb everything, which never got numb, he hit one of my top teeth with the needle and made a hole. The whole procedure was so incredibly painful and they just kept going. So now I have to get that hole fixed plus the tooth he put a deep hole in then filled, it still hurts. Also while drilling he hit so many surrounding teeth with the drill, made punctures and grooves in teeth that are now sensitive.  I can't chew  anything even a little bit crunchy on the right side of my mouth.  When I called asking for a refund nobody ever got back with me and they feel like they did everything right.
