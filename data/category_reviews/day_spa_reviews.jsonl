Even the repainting was not good. Nail polish is still on my skin, you can tell where the base coat is and the nail polish is.

I was told over the phone that they would not quote me prices because I had little girls getting their hair done so if it was simple it wouldn't cost as much. I also had to give them $100 deposit to hold the reservation (completely understandable until I arrived). One of the stylists was very nice but appeared to be more of an apprentice and had to keep asking for help to do the hair of the 2 younger girls. We were still charged full price for these styles ($75 for a 6 year old and 8 year old). One was a bun and did NOT look good and it didn't even resemble the picture we used. Again, she was very nice but the hair was not close to what we asked for. Two of the styles were supposed to be beachy waves and instead we left with weird curls and half done hair. Both charged $55 and took almost no time making it look even decent. They asked me to send pictures ahead of time for my hair and then clearly had not looked at them. I had to ask multiple times about fixing it (it was for my wedding after all) and while my stylist was nice enough to fix it she did seem VERY annoyed. I left with ok hair that I could live with (not exactly what I had in mind as a bride). And somehow I was charged the same price for mine as the 6 year old flower girl. The owner was pretty rude - she told my sister that she could put the little girls in a room and close the door while we waited. The same girls she charged full price updos for. I guess they were good enough to pay but not make noise in her salon? The last complaint was that the stylists kept stopping with our party to help a mom and bride that were also in the salon.

She\u2019s definitely sending me off right for my upcoming mommy makeover and might I add the receptionist was amazing and all smiles and the property was very clean \ud83d\ude0a But parking was crazy \ud83e\udd74 but overall experience 10/10 y\u2019all check out Maddie and tell her Jessica sent you\u2019ll \ud83e\udd70", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626d987dfed2e7:0xe55536739be2f6c7"}

The service is pretty fast. Im usually out in 20 mins or less and it's less painful then other places I have been to. My only concern is that for me, the hair tends to grow back wayyy faster when I go here compared to other places I've gotten serviced at. There were noticeable hair stubs all over less than a week after my wax as if I had only shaved a few days before, so I kind of felt like I wasted $50 when I could have just shaved at home which is what I'll more than likely have to do in a week anyway because it's growing so fast. The same thing occurred after my first visit as well, but because the customer service is great and the place is clean and well put together, I returned anyway. I don't know if they use a different type of wax from other places or what. When I've visited other places (before and after going to cabana for the first time), I didn't notice hair stubs until at least 2.5-3 weeks after the wax. I'd still recommend the place to others.

We are not a spa; we\u2019re a wax studio, and we do not advertise a spa environment :) most clients love our simple, no frills atmosphere and speedy service. It sounds like you had a facial waxing service. To be clear, our staff constantly sanitizes their hands between services (for their own protection and for that of our clients), and we have a 100 health rating from the Alabama Board of Cosmetology, which is on display in our reception area. Our technicians do not always use gloves during eyebrow wax services, because sometimes wax can get on the fingertip parts of a glove and get smudged onto parts of the brow line that are not meant to be waxed. In other words, in areas such as eyebrows where extra precision is needed to avoid removing too much hair, gloves can make the process more difficult. Gloves are always used during body waxing services.

I have never had a service where they used strips... do you know why strips aren\u2019t used in a Brazilian? Because our skin is so sensitive, the strips are too abrasive for it.

First, she\u2019s only been waxing for 5 years? That\u2019s quite a while (and Bri is very experienced), so I\u2019m not sure what you were expecting as far as years of experience. Second, there is no need for a formal \u201cskin analysis\u201d in the room; that\u2019s why we have you fill out a form in reception where we ask, among other things, whether you have used retinol, Accutane, alpha hydroxy acids, etc. in the area(s) to be waxed and whether you\u2019ve ever had a bad reaction to waxing. Even without a formal skin analysis as you call it, our technicians are analyzing your skin during the service and would immediately stop the service if there were any issues. Third, everyone who waxes at Cabana Wax has a current cosmetology or esthetics license, which is what the Alabama State Board of Cosmetology requires. The Board actually visited us a few weeks ago for our 2019 unannounced inspection (we got a 100), and licensure and cleanliness are the two main things they inspect. Your irresponsible comment about licensure insinuates that we are violating the law, which is slanderous, and I encourage you to remove it immediately. Finally, you had a chin wax; the technicians would never leave the treatment room door ajar for a Brazilian wax or any other intimate service.

The therapist we scheduled you with is used to working with athletes and has sports massage and myofascial release technique training which both use Deep Tissue work, but sometimes this doesn't necessarily translate into what a client would call or expect as Deep Pressure.

She matched my color i had on my nails perfectly with no hesitation. Lastly but surely not least Tracy done my hair. I have naturally curly and extremely thick hair and i wanted it washed dried and straightened. Not very many can get my hair straight. Well Tracy didnt disappoint.

{"user_id": "103804845592874345668", "name": "Tera Shade", "time": 1393167773078, "rating": 5.0, "text": "In response to the \"1 star\" review written 3 years ago.  I responded 2 days after it posted but it never showed up, so I'll try again with my response...When this review was first posted the person included her name (it has since been changed to \"anonymous\").  I called the reviewer and inquired about her time spent at Bliss.  You see, I am the owner and very concerned about our reputation and our guests experience.  I believe the following information will help you decided if you want to take this reviewer seriously.   Let me begin by saying this reviewer called late in the day to make an appointment to have her hair cut.  Even though we were booked until closing time, one of my stylist agreed to stay late and take the appointment.  The two employees behind the desk greeted this reviewer, offered her something to drink, and informed the stylist of her arrival.  Because it was now after closing time, the two front desk employees left for the day.  This reviewer was not left alone or ignored at any time.  The stylist who volunteered to stay late, finished with the client she was with and was on time for this reviewers scheduled appointment.  This reviewer had her hair shampooed, had more of a trim than a cut, and blown out.  She was charged $15.  Her comment about being charged three times what she should have been charged... Well, I don't know where a woman can get her hair shampooed, cut/trimmed, and blown out for $5.  She did say she was new to the area, so maybe she could get the above service done for $5 where ever she moved from...Just to be clear, Bliss does not offer shampoos, haircuts, and styles for $5....  I noticed she did not mention the amount she was charged.   Could it have been she as embarrassed to admit that she thought $15 was \"three times more than what it should have been.\" Because this reviewer posted this review under her name and because we had her phone number on file, I called and inquired about her time at Bliss.  I stated I was the owner and was making follow up calls with our new clients.  I did not  mention I had read her review but instead asked how she enjoyed her visit with us.  I gave her every opportunity to relate any unpleasant experience she might have had.  I was told that Bliss is a beautiful place and was thanked for taking her appointment on such short notice and after hours.  When asked how she like her hair cut even thought it really was only a trim, she responded \"I like it, she did a good job.\" During our conversation, she never said anything negative about her visit at Bliss, and when I invited her to return in the future she said she would.  To be honest, she has not returned .  I wish she had given us another chance so that she could experience what Bliss is really about.  I would also like to respond to the comment about the service being done half-hearted and with no conversation.  The stylist's mother had just passed away very unexpectedly two weeks earlier.  She was still mourning her loss but trying to live as normal as possible and continue to work and support herself.  While this reviewer had no clue what was happening in our stylist personal life, I think because of the comment she made in her review for all to read, its important for you to know why our stylist was not her usual outgoing friendly self.   I am very interested in making each client feel welcome and appreciated.  I personally follow up with as many clients as possible to make sure that their time at Bliss was relaxing and that they are satisfied with their service.  I know this has been a lot to read, but I wanted to give a little more information about the above review.  I am sure I am not the only business owner that is willing to go above and beyond what is normal to make their guest happy.  If something is not what you are expecting, please let us know.  Give us the opportunity to \"fix\" it.  Our guest are the reason we even have a business and we understand that, without \"you\" we wouldn't be here.  We look forward to seeing you and making you feel \"special\" like the person you are!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d61a6391ccb:0x7321ebb76dd3fc84"}

Reason for one star...\n\nThe services I asked for and what I actually received in turn was not good at all. I went in for a facial threading, wax, and lash extensions yet when I went home and looked at the work done via my closeup magnifying mirror I saw lots of hair still on my face and many missed hairs on my mustache area despite being plucked as well, so attention to detail definitely royally lacking in this area.\nNow, the service on my lashes was actually even worse. I went in with a picture of what style and length of lashes I was wanting and instead I left with the complete opposite as the so-called technician had admitted that she decided to go a couple of sizes up on length despite what I had requested, as well, she had missed some areas where there were gaps and so I asked for those areas to be filled and lashes trimmed since they were too long (not what I asked for), although she claimed she fixed them, NOT, I was treated with frustration and impatience after the touch up I asked for to the point that she left me in the room and didn't come back to check on me or say anything, she just went out and took another customer which clearly expressed to me that she was done with me despite the fact that she didn't do what I had asked for but instead what she wanted to do. And, after looking closer at them when I got home thru my magnifying mirror they looked horrid as all the glue was visible (not black glue) and stuck to many of the lashes which caused them to clump together and they were still too long. I really tried to deal with them, followed all the instructions (that by the way I was told upon leaving to take a picture of from their taped sheet on a mirror, really!), the best that I could but the length of them was just not natural looking to my face and the horrid clumped up lashes was just to much to deal with, SO, so disappointing.  It was even obvious by every one's look on their face when they saw me and some clearly said so. I finally had to have them carefully removed the next week. I WILL NEVER EVER, EVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE NOR WOULD I EVER RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE I KNOW, and I am not one to give bad reviews but in this case there was just too much of the bad to go around, just shameful! \u2639\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude1f...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917afd52227e1:0x2b150ddbd8c8374a"}

When she was No longer doing my hair it looked nice but I never got the compliments that I use to get when Laura Beth was doing my hair. Every time I would go get my hair done I would think I sure wish Laura Beth was still doing my hair i missed her. My husband started looking for a new job and we found out we were moving to Newnan,Ga. I started thinking, I wonder how far she is from where I was moving to. I got on Mapquest and it was 76 miles. I didn't care, it was worth every mile I drove for her to be doing my hair again. Ambiance is a very nice place and everyone there is very friendly. I met the owners that day and they are really nice. You won't regret going to Ambiance and getting Laura Beth to do your hair. Best decision I ever made to drive 76 miles to get my hair done.

I went in with some tension in my shoulders and upper back (pregnancy during a pandemic can be stressful \ud83e\udd23) so I called prior to my appointment to ask if the prenatal massage could be customized and if I could have more of a focus in that  area rather than in my lower back that typically accompanies pregnancy. Of course, the ladies up front that answered my call were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to check with the therapist instead of just placating me with some generic answer. They were also very friendly and professional when I arrived.\nOnce it came time for my massage, Tara explained everything first and made me feel completely at ease and comfortable. I did add on the Lavender aromatherapy and wondered if it would be worth it or not due to wearing a mask. It. Was. Worth. It. Just do it. You won\u2019t regret it. The massage itself was excellent and met all of my standards. There was a time or two that I almost felt like asking her to move on to a different area because the pressure was beginning to be too much for me (it was a good hurt, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just a wimp), but it was almost as if she was so in tuned with me that she moved on before I got to that point. At checkout, they were offering  a wellness package, and while I passed on it due to the fact that I\u2019ll be having a baby soon and won\u2019t have the availability for a while, it is definitely something I\u2019ll consider in the future.

I understand that it is annoying to call and be told there is available time, then be told something different when you call back.  She was confused because you were offered an 8:30 spot for 2, and our shortest couples massage is 60 minutes.  She should have clarified that you wanted 60 minutes instead of assuming it and she has been coached on how she should have handled the call.\n\nI would have ended now with an apology and an attempt to make you happy if your complaint was about the error, but that isn't what your review stated.  After listening, she sounded totally confused, was stammering, and could have chosen her words better, but I do not believe \"rude, nasty\" or \"I never been spoke to this way ever in my life.\" apply to the situation since her tone was confused, not attitude.  \"loud in my ear\" may be fair because her voice was louder than the first operator, but she did not raise her voice, the volume was just louder.\n\nViewers, judge for yourself (I'm sorry I can't attach the audio so you can see she did not raise her voice or have attitude). It was less than a minute.\n\nThanks for holding, I apologize for that waiting time, how may I help you?\"\n\nUm I just called just like 2 minutes ago and I talked to someone and they said they had, that they could probably do something at 8:30, tonight for 2 people.\n\nThey said they were going to try to do something to, hold on just, you talked to? hold on.

I understand that it is annoying to call and be told there is available time, then be told something different when you call back.  She was confused because you were offered an 8:30 spot for 2, and our shortest couples massage is 60 minutes.  She should have clarified that you wanted 60 minutes instead of assuming it and she has been coached on how she should have handled the call.\n\nI would have ended now with an apology and an attempt to make you happy if your complaint was about the error, but that isn't what your review stated.  After listening, she sounded totally confused, was stammering, and could have chosen her words better, but I do not believe \"rude, nasty\" or \"I never been spoke to this way ever in my life.\" apply to the situation since her tone was confused, not attitude.  \"loud in my ear\" may be fair because her voice was louder than the first operator, but she did not raise her voice, the volume was just louder.\n\nViewers, judge for yourself (I'm sorry I can't attach the audio so you can see she did not raise her voice or have attitude). It was less than a minute.\n\nThanks for holding, I apologize for that waiting time, how may I help you?\"\n\nUm I just called just like 2 minutes ago and I talked to someone and they said they had, that they could probably do something at 8:30, tonight for 2 people.\n\nThey said they were going to try to do something to, hold on just, you talked to? hold on. (pause for a breath) Maam, we don't, we don't have an opening at 8:30 because they close at 9:00. You have to have it done before.\n\nSo who did I talk to?\n\naa, you spoke to another of our our our other operators.  Yeah, she spoke with you, but you won't be able to do that.\n\nOK, cause she told me something else but I will go with another massage place thank you bye bye"}, "gmap_id": "0x888918bb2ec6e57d:0x1a53ce7ffe081b00"}

She showed me some diagrams and explained some of the muscle areas that could be causing the pain.  The deep tissue massage with Kate was the best massage I\u2019ve ever had.  Throughout the session Kate communicated with me regarding the amount of pressure and what specific areas were continuing to trouble me.  Before I left, she showed me some stretches that I can do to alleviate some of my back and neck pain.  In my opinion, Kate went above and beyond just the hour massage I paid her for.

I have signed up for a directory service to give clients direct access to an appointment specialist or to me. Hopefully the recorded options won't just annoy people.\n\nI apologize for the extended hold time.  I understand how frustrating it is to be left on hold and am so sorry you experienced it when calling us.  I contacted my answering service to find out why you were left on hold so long and to find out if this is a regular thing and I'm just now finding out about it.  What I found out is that what you experienced is not common.  I'll try to explain why it happened below.  Please note; it's an explanation, not an excuse.\n\nThe answering service was able to determine which number called twice and was left on hold, so I have your number, but I don't want to call you in case the call would be unwelcome.  I'd like to make it up to you by offering 30 minutes free to make up for the hold time.   Once again, I'm terribly sorry and will try to limit the chances of it happening again.\n\n(1) Not all their operators can make appointments for us.  Our answering service does not just take messages,  they give information, make appointments, and take credit card information.  In order to keep errors down, they have certain people who are allowed to make appointments and take credit card info, so when you call and want more than information, and one of those people is on the phone, you will have to wait until one of them is free.\n\nWe keep our prices competitive with independents rather than spas by not paying for a receptionist.  Our clients have consistently said they'd prefer to wait 2 min on hold with our service than get my voicemail and have to wait for me to call back (The average hold time when one of our specialists is not available is 1.9 min.  Most of the time someone can take the call right away.)\n\n(2)  They had a couple of our appointment specialists call in sick, so the pool of people who could take your appointment was reduced.\n\n(3)  You called at 5:05:31 and 5:12:05.  Their peak call time is 4:30-5:30 and with several people out sick their hold time was longer than usual. As I said, I will try to make myself available during this time to reduce the likelihood of being placed on hold in the future.\n\nJenae"}, "gmap_id": "0x888918bb2ec6e57d:0x1a53ce7ffe081b00"}

I called in to make what I thought was an appointment for a Brazilian wax, she told me to be there @ 4. I arrived at 3:55. Once entering the building I was not greeted or asked did I need help or to sign in. I patiently waited because I know it\u2019s prom season and she will\nHave a lot of clients. So eventually it was my turn up. As I entered the room I informed her that I was a first timer and I didn\u2019t understand the process. She asked me to take my pants off and lay on the table. Once laying there she put me in the butterfly position, she took the baby powder and just sprayed it from the rotor to the tutor #literally and started placing HOT WAX all over my vagina area. At that moment I knew this was about to regret this decision. I never seen/heard where you place HOT WAX all over the area at once. Then she began pulling away. I let her know that it was really painful and i don\u2019t think it suppose to be this painful. She let me know my hair was course and it takes to long to do it in small sections which I was accustomed to from hearing other describe their experiences.. I allowed her to pull a total of 7 times before I called a quits! Once I let her know to stop she Rudely told me that I would have to get the remaining wax(on my lips) of myself and to get it off use Baby oil. I told her that I was afraid to place my under garments back on because the wax will stick to them and that will be another tragedy I will have to deal with! She told me to put a napkin right there, I declined them she threw me a baby wipe and walked out the room!! This is by far the worse thing to encounter. I forgot to tell y\u2019all she pulled so hard that I was bleeding in multiple places on my bikini line. This is a sensitive area and I entrusted her to take her time and get the job done in a professional manner. I\u2019ve never encountered anything like this in my life whatever y\u2019all do, do not go to PAM in trussville @MOON DAY SPA!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc7963e254d:0x308c0b755d4ea7f1"}

Disclaimer: I recently moved from Atlanta, and love my previous eyebrow threading/wax location (Unique Threading and Waxing), so I held this place to high standards. The prices are similar.\n\nI went for a Brazilian and underarm wax.\nThe interior is subpar - their needs to be an update. The lighting is dim and it made me feel as though it was not clean. The waxing table is made of faux leather (which is not a problem) but it was pealing. She placed some paper on the table, but I did have to ask her to place more to cover the entire table prior to me getting onto the table.  She stayed in the room while I was getting undressed - which was kind of weird.  The floor was dirty, it needed to be swept. There was long hair as if someone combed there hair there or perhaps the room had been used for salon clients?\n\nThe waxing was going well. Painful, but not out of the ordinary.  She did not double dip. She gave me a pair of gloves to assist, but during the processed I noticed that I was bleeding. She had ripped some of my skin off during the Brazilian!  I have had many waxes, but this was the first time I had ever had that happen. I noticed that she was applying wax to large areas at a time then removing smaller portions. I've never seen it done that way, and perhaps that's what caused it.\n\nShe kept the same bloody gloves on while touching the other products like the powder and removed them after I had grimaced. The underarm wax was fine. But this was my first and last time going to this location. She stayed in the room while I got dressed, but then left to go to the register. I didn't see her wipe down any of the items she touched or the table.  Some of the reviews say they are unsanitary - this is correct in my opinion.\n\nI'm not quite sure how it got such great ratings. I suspect that someone is removing bad ratings, or maybe I'm just unlucky.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc7963e254d:0x308c0b755d4ea7f1"}

I started out getting the eyebrows done. I had them threaded for the first time ever. Honestly, this hurt a ton less than waxing (but I have a high pain tolerance). Afterwards, we drew on the exact shape of brow that I wanted, numbed the outmost layer of skin, and set to work. It was a bit painful to draw the outline in, but afterwards my eyebrows were completely numbed to begin the full fill in process. It did not hurt at all at this point, just felt a weird scratching sensation. I would say the least pleasurable part of this experience was the scratching sound/feeling. My brows turned out exactly how I wanted. I now have cut my makeup time down to about 10 minutes tops. I am excited to see my brows fade over time and see how they turn out.\n\nAs for the waxing, I did not see anything unsanitary about the process. The woman who did my wax did not double dip the wax stick. Instead, she placed the wax she used on me in a smaller container, from the large melting pot, using a clean spoon. The only part I did not enjoy about the waxing was that they did not use numbing spray like my previous esthetician and they did not fully remove all of the wax residue afterwards, which left me feeling sticky.\n\nI also got mink eyelash extensions for the first time, just to try them out. My eyelashes feel beautiful. I definitely recommend getting them, but I would say try to keep yourself awake. It is very easy to get relaxed and fall asleep, but then you might jolt yourself awake like I did and end up with a little stinging sensation in your eye. But I loved the end result. My lashes are naturally straight, but now they are wonderfully curly and full.\n\nI was charged for the threading, which I thought was included in the microblading, so that came as small shock. However, even though I did not purchase the lash extension on Groupon, Moon honored the Groupon price. I went to the Trussville location, which was extremely clean and convenient. I will be trying out the Galleria location for my follow up waxes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc7963e254d:0x308c0b755d4ea7f1"}

So I purchased a very expensive perfect package for my girl as a surprise Valentine's day present at this location bc ive sent her here once before and she seemed to enjoy it. Well the lady at the desk inquired on who it was for and apparently submitted the information under her name where as MY email confirmation went directly to my girl, where she called me informing me she knew my plans for her, spoiling the surprise!!! That should have never happened! I then called and explained my irritation and informed them I was coming for a refund. They called me back like it was no biggy like cool we can just refund this over the phone for you rather than saying hey i'm sorry is there any way we can make this right for you! I'm a funny, chill laid back dude, but if you ruin a surprise, that is my one and only immediate heartbreak bc that ruins the joy of spending lots of money to be able to see the expression on your womans face of how happy she is. Presents are for the givers and for the receivers bc we both enjoy feeling the happiness of THE SURPRISE!! Please resolve this issue, bc i'm a man of morality bc now my woman is upset with me bc I refunded the package but I simply can NOT do business with folks that aren't in it for the satisfaction of those spending their hard earned money! So now, I had Valentine's all planned out perfect to the T, I no longer have the \"kaboom\" gift available, and now there is all this negative energy between me and my woman bc I know she still wants the package but I can not allow it bc the surprise was so important to me i absolutely had to have my money back so that this place would know and preferably remember that they ruined something for two special people! I wouldn't dare ask for something free, I would feel bad for taking anything not earned, but as a man that runs  a business, I make free offers every day to ensure customer satisfaction and that they come back!!

If you could let me know when it was that you had your visit with us and anything we can do to have made your experience more welcoming and relaxing?  We always appreciate when people take the time to let us know how we are doing. In some cases they do get us mixed up with a Serenity near us that we are not affiliated with.

However, as a Licensed Esthetics Instructor that researched extensively the salt cave benefits prior to constructing our specially designed Salt Cave. I would like to share facts regarding the salt cave with you.\n\u2022\tTaking wellness to another level, halotherapy (a.k.a. Salt Therapy) is similar to spending time in the salty sea air, which offers many more benefits than \u201csleeping\u201d on the beach.\n\u2022\tAncient Healers and Philosophers recommended salt inhalation for the respiratory system and health problems. Dry salt therapy originates from speleotherapy (cave therapy). This was discovered in Poland where workers exhibited fewer respiratory illnesses.   There are thousands of salt rooms in Europe and beyond.\n\u2022\tThe benefits of Salt Therapy are wide-ranging.  Salt levels affect our cell activity, energy, and blood sugar levels.  A natural disinfectant, salt is antimicrobial, and antibacterial.  Salt comes in empty processed forms or healthier pure sea salts that contain 84 elements and trace elements found in the human body.  Dry salt air is more powerful than moist air.\n\u2022\tNegatively charged ions in salt improve our health and mood.  Inhaling particles may reduce inflammation and mucus in the lungs, improving respiratory conditions such as asthma, allergies, bronchitis, sinus congestion, and C.O.P.D.   We have seen physical proof of many of these conditions improving through our loyal clients.\n\u2022\tThe calming and detoxifying effects of halotherapy can support the immune, nervous and lymphatic systems.   Additional benefits are reduced stress and headaches, increased energy and better sleep patterns.  Salt ions purify the air and may increase lung capacity and reduce physical ailments for adults, children and athletes.  A series of treatments are recommended to keep the body healthy during flu or allergy season.    So, this is why we offer packages to continue your treatments.\n\u2022\tA session will last 45 minutes. For mild to moderate respiratory conditions, 10 to 12 sessions are recommended, depending on individual results. For best results, sessions should be 4 to 5 times per week.   Since everyone responds differently to therapy, this is provided as an average upon which to gauge your personal experience.   After the initial set of treatments, you should follow up at least once per week.\n\nThe Salt Cave temperature was accurate and is temp and humidity controlled by its individual unit. Blankets were provided in the salt cave for your comfort in the temp controlled room.   To be freezing in there, it was your decision not to use the provided amenities.\n\nWhile your wife enjoyed her massage that was paid for via gift certificate, you chose to participate in a service as well.    Our company policy states that Gift Certificates are only used for the person that they were purchased for.  Therefore, your salt session could not be added to her gift certificate.   The remainder of her certificate will be for her to relax and enjoy other services.\n\nWe have been in business over 25 years, and our reputation speaks for itself. Our moto has always been \u201cWhere You Come To Get Away\u201d.  We strive to maintain an environment and technology free zone that offers an opportunity for our clients to get away from the stresses of everyday life. It is your opinion that you found this \u201cboring\u201d. Following your treatment yesterday, you enjoyed our front porch swing, while on your cell phone. You expressed to me, that you understood the concept of the salt, because while you were living in Florida you \u201cspent many nights sleeping on the beach\u201d.\n\nIn response to your review, We pray that you will take this reply positively and learn the facts of the salt cave and our business rather than negatively portraying our business.\n\nGod Bless,\nPenny Ogle,\nLicensed Esthetics Instructor\nOwner"}, "gmap_id": "0x8861d93395331f91:0x4ea606343bb0ccd4"}
