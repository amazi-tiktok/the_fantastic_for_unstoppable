And they are worried that they will not get their money?!!! And this is a quote from a representative from their business.  If I could leave 0 stars, I would.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1556229316196, "text": "Dear Ms. Holder.  I am very sorry you feel that our company is not providing the hospital bed and wheelchair because of being \u201cworried that they will not get their money\u201d.  That is not the main issue in this case, however.  Being paid for the equipment is important to us but most importantly is the medical necessity for the items provided.  Medicare has specific guidelines that we must follow in providing equipment that is ordered and if we do not follow them, not only payment is not received but it opens us up to potential Fraud and Abuse issues with Medicare for billing items that the medical records do not support.  Our Store Manager, myself and another clinical person reviewed the records and documents we have received from the physician\u2019s office who is ordering the equipment and what we have so far, does not show medical necessity for the bed and chair.  We have asked for records that do support it and as of date, not received anything that does.  It is not our desire to withhold needed equipment from anyone who needs it, but we are compelled to follow established guidelines that support it which as of now, not supported by records in our possession.  We would be happy to schedule a meeting with the customer and/or yourself, if you are a designated representative, to provide a copy of the medical necessity requirements and discuss how the records we have compares to the requirements.  Please feel free to contact our local store and let us know when a good time would be.  Again, I am sorry for how you feel but we are not intentionally trying to cause stress for you or the customer.  We are simply following the medical policy established by Medicare."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626cc7b1740001:0x31de57b0821398c5"}
