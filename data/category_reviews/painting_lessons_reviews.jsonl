When we arrived, we were told they did not have anyone signed up for that class. My daughter showed her email for payment conformation. The instructor said she would have to cut our pieces. It seemed a bother. We stood around for a while & she finally told us to sit with another class. I feel like we were not shown the attention as everyone else. We had to ask for paint, brushes, & water to clean the brushes. We are pretty crafty so we just looked at the sample and completed it on our own. We did not get holes drilled for the hanger...she could not work the drill and the piece was not sealed. I do not recommend this business. Everyone should be treated with the same attention.....very disappointed!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b429faac5db:0xb11d47d73171010c"}

There was little to no direction by the \"instructor\" who made it VERY clear that she was not supposed to be there that late and informed us that the girl who was supposed to teach the class couldn't make it.\nLike many other establishments like this, they offer a variety of painting classes at different levels of difficulty. You also have the option to \"upgrade\" your painting by purchasing a larger canvas.\nAnother thing that most of these places do is sell the paintings that the instructors do during every class. I wish I could say that they're affordable and worth the price, but that definitely is not the case. When I inquired about which paintings were for sale and about the general cost, the woman got snarky with me. After paying well over $100 to for little to no instruction and having an overall bland experience, I did not want to give this place any more of my money.\nPAINTER'S TIP:\nI would suggest stopping by Walmart (or ordering off Amazon) and getting a cheap variety pack of paintbrushes (I posted a photo of the pack I purchased). I found that the brushes they supplied were a little worn out and often I couldn't get my lines as thin as I wanted them (I have a heavy hand).", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b429faac5db:0xb11d47d73171010c"}
