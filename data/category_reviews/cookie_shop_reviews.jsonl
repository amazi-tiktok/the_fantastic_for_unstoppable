A few have made it to being a fan favorite - Cherry Amaretto, Pumpkin Spice, Toasted Coconut, and Orange Cranberry. The regular size scones are a bit more moist, and have a stronger flavor.\n\nWe highly recommend them, and have not been disappointed with any of our orders!!

Me trying to be a good husband, she told me that she would like to try so I immediately told her let's do it. We called to make our order and were both very happy with the customer service and ease of the process and selection on short notice. We were on the circle across town so we made it there in just a few minutes. I went inside and was greeted in the most cozy, comfy place I had ever been in Dothan by a very sweet, kind lady(wish I had gotten her name so I could thank her on here but too late now, thank you for you're awesome service). Our order was already prepared that quickly but the case had items my wife didn't mention so risking getting in trouble (lol not really but husband's will understand) I asked if I could add a few items and without hesitation she was ready to help me. She packaged it up, gave me a total, I paid, and left it was a wonderful all around experience. This was the simplest part of this review lol. Skip forward a few hours, we are home and have had dinner and my wife is ready to try out the cupcakes. We both had a red velvet cupcake first and we had to stop what we were doing and thinking about to take in the experience that was happening. I can not explain in words how perfect they were, texture, smell and the taste... OMG, hands down the best red velvet anything that I've ever had my entire life (I'm 33), we then had to try another one so we each tried a different one so we could taste more without eating too much and still try more because we are still both in shock of the amazing thing happening. I got a key lime cupcake and she got a birthday cake cupcake, again we both were blown away by how incredible this all was. She is actually rushing me now because I had to stop then and write this review to let anyone know, who has a sweet tooth or any reason to get a treat, this is the place to go. We will go back in future and tell everyone we know to go try it because it is that great of an all around experience start to finish.

When showed to me this time, I saw that an exclamation point had been put after Cater instead of a comma.
