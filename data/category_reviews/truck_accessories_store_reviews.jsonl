Well I called 2 days ago and left message for him and told them it was about the blazer, she said ok he will call you back. Never heard anything. My husband calls up there today and he isn't in so my husband asked if blazer was still there. Guy says no we sold it back last week.\ud83d\ude21 Well good damn thing we told guy that was buying ours that we couldn't do deal until the day we was able to get other one.

I  can not believe the incompetence of the employees here.\n\nIt seems that the responder to this post has also failed to pay attention. Is this a company wide incompetence?

They reassured us that our long journey to them would not be one we regret but full of great memories. We have nothing but positive things to say about this corporate Line-X store.\n\nConsidering we were not planning on staying in Huntsville they was able to get our truck in and out within the same amount of time it took us to drive there. :-) Plus provided us with great local tips on places to visit while we waited and even gave us a rad F-150 truck to drive around and told us NOT to worry about the gas!\n\nWe were able to get into the actual corporate headquarters (pics weren't really allowed sry) & learned a little about the whole process while we waited on our truck.\n\nCheck out the day & sexy night pics below!\n\nWe drove 4 hours to get the BEST!

I would have to ask you why not?\n\nThus far I have purchased Yeti steersmarts, Rock Krawler X-Factor Longarm, Fox 2.5 Coilovers, PSC Steering system, RockHard roll cage, Adams 1350 Drive shafts (front and rear), RCV fron axle shafts, Yukon chromoly rear axles shafts and EVO front truss. All pricing beat or at least matched online prices and had everything in hand in same week.\n\nI installed some things myself, but Outlaw Offroad installed the front truss and Rock Krawler X-Factor Longarm. While doing so, they corrected my alignment of the PSC RAM, fixed some wiring to my rear ABS Sensors (at no cost, they just wanted it right for me).\n\nAt my request we split the Longarm install, did the front in December and did the rear just yesterday (3/13/20) and let me tell you, knowing I was trying to get it ready for MOAB trip, they got my jeep in and out the same day, even while doing the extra things I mentioned above and even though they, themselves are in EJS crunch time. They stayed late till 10pm to take care of me, no they didn't have to, they did it cause they wanted too and wanted to make me happy. They did that, cause they are jeepers too and know what it is like to want to get your vehicle back to you and you enjoy the new upgrades, they did that because that is just who they are and how they are.\n\nSo I ask again......Why not use Outlaw Offroad for any and all of your 4x4 needs???

TAPCO kept my car for over a week while making no attempts to contact and update me on the repair details. I had to call them daily. They did not give me an estimate for the repair and I was stuck with a $200 bill after paying them $300 the week prior. I went in for a new belt and to look at an oil leak and $500 later and my oil light is still on. Also they misgendered me (transman) the entire transaction. Very cool. Also your car will be sitting outside unlocked after they have worked on it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1623959183961, "text": "Cale, I apologize that you felt mistreated. You brought the vehicle in for the oil leak and we found your axle seal to be leaking. This is on the transmission side of your vehicle. The seal was replaced and you also requested a new drive belt which we happily installed for you. I advised you that there may be further oil leaks, and we would need to keep an eye on it and to bring it back in if oil was still visibly leaking on the ground. You had the vehicle towed in for a no start issue. After 3 hours of diagnosis not charged to you, we found that there was an ECM update needed for the vehicle. This is not a service we provide, and I know the advisor informed you that we were waiting on the programmer to come and flash the ECM. The advisor should of given you a rough estimate of cost for this service and I apologize he did not. We also did not know what the cost would be for the service because it has ranged from $45.00 to $400 in the past. So as we knew the fix, the cost was out of our hands. Once the programmer arrived, he performed the flash on the ECM, the vehicle cranked, and he gave me a bill for $200. We called you, let you know the vehicle was repaired and the cost was $200. We literally did not make one dime off of you, and spent 3 hours of diagnosing to confirm we had the right fix for you ( Normally a $345 cost). If your oil light is still on, then you may have another oil leak on the engine side and would need to address that issue, just as I advised you personally. As far as misgendering, we apologize, not really sure what else to say. We will do better with that situation as a whole. We apologize again for the way you feel. We were just doing our best to get your vehicle back in your hands, at the cheapest cost possible. We are not magicians, nor fortune tellers. We do not control when a vehicle breaks, or what mechanical part may fail and start leaking. All we do is advise the best path forward with as much information as we have to give the customer the best chance to make the right decision for themselves. Thank you for business. Please let us know if we can further assist you with your cars in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb89a66390d:0xc218ac2ba8793b57"}

I normally work on my car myself, but am willing to pay others to do so when problems are above my experience. I asked them to fix whatever it was that made the check engine light be on, which I knew was something with the vacuum system. I also asked them to fix two windows that weren\u2019t working. They \u201cfixed\u201d my car and gave it back to me. Well on my drive home, I discovered a rat chewed halfway through my seat belt and left dropping in the floorboard that they did not clean up. The next day I let them know when I got off work and they said to bring it in and they would fix it. And they did, but they replaced my seatbelt with a black one and my interior is grey. When they replaced my window regulators, they left metal chips from drilling all in my carpet and leather interior, so they did not do a clean job and did not clean up after themselves. ALSO, my check engine light came back on and was running the same codes as it was before I brought it to them. So then I had to leave it with them for several more days. They had my car for over one week. One last thing is that my driver window was tight before they serviced it and made no road noise. Now, it leaks air over fifty and I don\u2019t want to have to bring the car back to them for a third time. That same door now makes an awful rattling noise when it shuts, which it also did not do before they touched my car. I have had pleasant experiences with them in the past, and I left reviews those times as well but service was not what it use to be this visit.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608237580748, "text": "Arthur,\nSorry to hear about your displeasure with our work. Lets start from the top. The vehicle was brought in after you personally attempted to repair many issues with the vehicle yourself and admitted that you may have done something wrong as everything you had done has still not fixed it and the same check engine lights remain on and the vehicle was running rough, even after you worked on it personally. We used our extensive diagnostic equipment and found multiple leaks throughout your vehicles intake system. I personally called and told you we had found these leaks and would need to take off the intake manifold you just put on yourself to see what was going on under it, as that is where the main leak was. I also notified you that there was an code in your ecu for the EGR system and that it may be triggered by the massive intake leak and we would need to correct the major leak first, and let you drive the vehicle to see if there was still an issue with the EGR system. The EGR Valve was also covered with epoxy from what looked to be a band aid repair from a previous time. This could be an issue, but during the diagnosis we did check each component of the system and did confirm the actuators and the valves were operating as they should.  Once we had your approval for the work, we moved forward. Once the intake manifold was removed, we found that you had left the old intake gaskets on the engine and also used the new gaskets of the intake manifold you just replaced. This is what we call being \"double gasketed\" and quickly saw this was the issue with the massive intake leak. We purchased new intake gaskets since the new ones you installed were severely damaged. We removed the old gaskets and cleaned the surface to ensure proper sealing on installation. Everything went together very smooth on the install and a quick smoke test found that the leak was no longer and the issue was repaired. The codes were cleared and the vehicle was test driven and confirmed that the vehicle was running properly and no longer had any further codes in the system. You were called and told the good news and were made aware that the EGR valve was still in question but would need significant miles put on it to be addressed. Once you took the vehicle and drove it, the light came back on and when you brought it back in we found that the same EGR code was back and found that the EGR Valve that you epoxied was blocking the air passage and triggering the light. You were not charged any further diagnosis and we repaired the EGR valve and there was no further issue.\n\nAfter these issues were handled you requested that we look at your windows. The window regulators were found to be the issue at hand and they are riveted in from the factory and are very difficult to perfect. We Use OEM ford rivets and installed them to perfection with the factory holes in the door that were not modified in any way shape or form. I do apologize there is wind noise with the window now, we would be glad to take care of this issue and resolve it for you at no cost.  I was also not aware of the pieces in the floor that were claimed to be left by us, and I sincerely apologize for the possible mess left behind. I would be glad to provide a complimentary vacuum of your interior from a detail shop of your choosing. There was a good bit of mess on the floor, including crumbs and such, so we may of overlooked what mess we made, versus what mess was there before we began our work.\n\nThe seatbelt issue. We have never had a rat issue before at this location. We have been here for 8 years and never once faced an issue of the sort. We have biweekly pest control services done and stay very proactive with pest control due to the known issues of old downtown buildings and sewer systems. When brought to our concern, we replaced your belt with an OEM Ford part and purchased it by your VIN number at no cost. The interior in your vehicle was sun faded and that is why there is a color difference."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb89a66390d:0xc218ac2ba8793b57"}

They charged my daughter $100 to tell her that her check engine light meant her gas cap was loose. If they'll take advantage of a 19 y/o girl who's out of state, what else do you think they'll do? Seriously: $100 to read a check engine light code and (literally) tighten a gas cap. #epicfail", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608235243266, "text": "Kevin, I believe you may not fully understand the process of diagnosis on a vehicle. We take pride in our diagnosis and ensure the diagnosis is correct before we tell a customer any type of estimate. Our standard diagnostic rate is $100 and we roll that fee into the repair if you decided to do the repair with us. We have signage throughout the main office with this verbiage and discuss the process with customers as they drop a vehicle off. But yes, lets walk through it so you and everyone can understand. First, we read that check engine light on the vehicle, and used the $6500.00 computer scanner to do so. We went through and found every lasting detail on the issue down to the date it happened and how often it happened. That is where Autozone stops. They get their $30 scan tool out and tell you 10 guesses of items it could be. So now that we have a lot of data, and approved $100 of diagnostic work on the vehicle ( up to 1 hour of diagnosis ) we can move forward and start using our years of training and knowledge to properly diagnose your vehicle. Now my technician gets out his smoke machine (a $1600 tool)  that pressurizes your daughters Evap Emissions system and also fills the system with smoke so we can determine if there is a leak on the system. Then we put the vehicle on our $4500 lift to ensure that we inspect every inch of the system that has a fault. We also use the scanner in the above mentioned process to activate all of the solenoids of the evap system to ensure they are working properly and letting the system properly work. So now that we have used our multi thousand dollars in tools and years of knowledge that is priceless, we have determined your daughters system is actually in perfectly working condition and the only fault is that a personal mistake happened of someone leaving the gas cap loose! Whew! Seems like quite a lot for such a simple task, right?  Well what if you went by the local auto parts store, got a free scan on the vehicle and they sold you an evap canister for your daughters vehicle and then you take it somewhere for an install and spend $1000.00 and the same problem remains. I am sure this review would look a lot different if you took into consideration the time, the effort, the knowledge, and the care that was put into your 19 year olds daughter vehicle to ensure we did not sell her any parts or service she did not need and made sure she was getting the most honest and best value possible when she put her trust in our shop. I apologize you feel like we took advantage of her. I hope that you see we spent a careful amount of time ensuring we had a proper diagnosis, and realize that doing so does not come free. This business is how we feed our families and have done so for 8 years. If we did not charge customers for diagnosis, then we would become a charity, and likely go out of business, and your daughter would be stuck down the street at the dishonest shop that sold her thousands in repair work that was not needed. I am certainly glad to hear your daughters vehicle is still doing well and the check engine light has not come back on after our thorough diagnosis, with out costing her any extra money.  If you would like to further discuss this issue you are welcome to call me, Michael Lee, the owner whenever you would like to. I would be glad to walk you through our process and make sure you fully understand the extent of work we did ensuring your daughters vehicle was safe and properly diagnosed and why the $100.00 was charged. Most would consider it an #epicsave , you know, since we were the honest shop that did not take advantage of her and took every possible step to make sure her vehicle was diagnosed properly.

Additionally, they did not push me to fix or change anything I was not ready to do and spent time discussing the pros and cons of fixing or not fixing a part. They went out of their way to test drive my car after fixing the starter to ensure it ran correctly and went above and beyond to contact Honda to find my radio code. The employees at Tapco made this a painless and pleasant experience. I trust them completely and can honestly say they are the only auto company I will deal with again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb89a66390d:0xc218ac2ba8793b57"}

They are 40 minutes from where we live, but highly recommended by a friend. Great experience, it was quick, under an hour and it looked great. So we schedule my car for the 1st available appt., a couple of months away. No problem. My husband wasn't able to pay deposit over the phone that day - somekind of trouble with payment system. Female told my husband no problem, we were a repeat customer. Morning of 1 pm appointment I call to confirm time only to find my appointment had been cancelled because a deposit wasn't paid and they had already scheduled another for that time slot. She said he (her husband?) tried contacting me the day before but I had just swapped to a new phone -and my voice mail wasn't set up yet. Next available appt.was in May. I just tell her I'll reschedule, or find another place to have it done. She offered to call if there was a cancellation.  My husband calls them and reminds her that she said the deposit issue was okay. She admits she didn't make a note of it and they can get me in. I take my lunch hour and an extra hour (or so) off from work, drive 40 minutes one way, then when I say I'll just wait while it's being done, he says that it will take 3-4 hours for my sedan. I based my timeline on our previous experience (<1 hour) and we were NOT told on any of the three phone calls leading up to the appointment to expect a 3-4 hour window! They even knew I was driving from 40 minutes away. I am not bashing this business, I am just sharing my experience.

Took my 6.0 LQ4 block, crank and heads to have them reworked, cleaned and check to see if they were still within spec limits. We discussed engine gaskets rebuild kits. I left and then called on the phone to discuss more pricing and gaskets again. I went back to stewarts to bring some more parts to be cleaned but on that visit talked again about rebuild kits and gaskets. Now each time i talked to the owner about the gasket sets i asked, were they felpro? his answer every time was yes they will be felpro. He gave me a price which was little more then what i had search online for but i decided to go with his kit since the gaskets were definitely felpro . well is snowed the next day and roads were closed so i had to wait another day for him to finish. roads were still bad so he came in late but he was finished around lunch time. So when i get there to pick up my parts i ask where is the rebuild kit. The machinist shows me the box and the gaskets sets are not felpro, they are Victor reins gaskets. I refused to buy the kit because he told me a they would contain felpro. The machinist told me that felpro and victor reins were made by the same company that they were the exact same gaskets. That was his first lie too me. Those are two entirely different companys, with different pricing and materials. so we deducted the kit and now i owe for the machine work done, which is 345.00 I pay the balance go home and start unloading the block and notice the cam bearing that they installed for me were damaged from the installation too. Took it back and the owner said he doesn't know any other way to put those bearings in. well duh!!! but you don't damage them when they go in , if you do damage them then you take them out and install new ones. but they sent me home with that crap. so i decided to look over the heads real good since things are already not good. well the heads are aluminum heads , they look as if someone took a wire brush to clean the mating surfaces on the heads. they are scratched badly. there are several scratches going across the from one cylinder to the other which will leak when it is installed back on the block. So i took the heads back to stewarts this morning and asked to talk to someone about this and the owner wasn't there but the machinist was. so i showed the head to the machinist and asked what he did to it. he said he milled it. i asked is that acceptable? he said yes. i asked if he could show me any where in writing, online or any mechanic that can tell me that those scratches on the mating surface of the head was acceptable .The machinist looked at me and said pick my head up and get the hell out of there. You can imagine what my response was. :) but I'm not happy with this and the place of business is just horrible. I have been building engines for over 23 years and i have never seen anyone tell me that scratches on a aluminum head was acceptable to install. They refused to take of this and now i have to take the heads and have them resurfaced if they can even be resurfaced again. i also heve to take the block and crank to another machine shop to have them check and correct everything stewarts touched. BEWARE SHOTTY WORK AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. STAY AWAY if you want good work performed.\n\nYour Desired Resolution:\nAt this point all i want is a complete refund for the services they performed. I tried to go back to talk to them and i was told to get the hell out of their store. The work performed was bad and i don't fell comfortable letting them touch anything else of mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cb974de7cfd5:0xb07e55d35fc40cf9"}

The vehicle in question was brought in because the ignition switch was defective. Due to the connector going to the anti-theft module was not making connection. After I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the chevy dealer I found the connector was not available. I instructed your daughter to go and get a complete unit with a new pig tail. After explaining to them that a code reading would bring no results to identify the issue. I did allow the vehicle to sit in my parking lot until the problem could be addressed. Most places charge several hundred dollars to do this. Several days later they brought in a switch from a junk yard that was ripped out and badly damaged. I told them they could not use part due to being damaged. After a couple days a night time worker offered to help with diagnostics, he brought his scan tool and tried to diagnosis the issue.

Update (3-19-18) - When I picked up the truck from commercial van it was very dirty and there were little pieces of bed-liner plastic stuck all over the truck. It looked like over-spray, but they came off when I wiped them, thinking that this wouldn't be a problem I took the truck home (that was my big mistake). I didn't notice the paint chips until after I went home and washed all the little pieces of over-spray plastic off. There are 2 chips next to the drivers side Z71 emblem a gouge in the clear coat right above the drivers side tail light and 2 large chips in the clear coat between the bed and cab on the passengers side. All of these are in the immediate area around where they were working.  I also found a scuff where something rubbery with grit on it was dragged across my passenger rear door and had to use buffing compound to get it off. If you have work done there you need to stay and watch them, because as with any auto shop damage done will never be \"their\" fault.  Troy the owner called me this morning and asked if I was the one that wrote the bad review of his business. When I told him yes I wrote it he said that review is unnecessary and that I had planned to scam him from the start. When I got tired of listening to his accusations I hung up on him. He then calls me back and leaves a message telling me I was extremely unprofessional and I was no longer welcome at his business. As the owner of a business that relies on good experiences with customers it is HIS job to be the professional. And the professional thing to do would have been to ask me to bring it back so they could look at the damage instead of accusing me of being a scammer. All I was going to ask for was some touch up paint so I could fix it myself, but all I got was hostility and accusations. My father is going to get a bed-liner done on his truck, but he will not be using Commercial Van Specialists in Loxley. Troy and his \"business\" will never get another dime of my money, nor will they get any business from any of my family and friends.  When I give someone money to work on my vehicle I expect them to treat it and me with respect, but these people fall terribly terribly short.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6e8131eab6fb:0xa40d31008c34e55a"}

I write this review after driving an hour and a half to do business with them.  First off all, they do more than trucks.  30 inch rims for your car they do it, headlights, taillights, lifts, flares, tonneau covers, etc... if you want it they can get it.  There prices are hard to beat.  But let me talk about what sets them apart from everyone besides their exceptional pricing.  From the moment you walk in you are treated with respect and that they are glad to see you there.  They listen very intently to what you want whether in person or on the phone.  This is missed by so many other places.  They go through getting prices as well as can show you options.  They do this to make sure you get exactly what you want for the best price.  While doing so they take notes on the conversation to ensure they don't have to ask you several times because they forgot.  Making sure they stay on top of it and making everything move flawless.  The business is very well maintained and the showroom is definitely a showroom, not just a display, spotless.  Respect and honesty is projected so loudly by the staff, you will feel like its your own family that runs the business.  I can't say enough about this because I have been there a few times for different purchases and  the entire staff is friendly as well as great to interact with.  As I return to them next week to make another purchase, driving an hour and a half versus using the internet, I know I am meeting people who are like family, getting the best price, the right part, quality parts, but also the best service that I have seen in the state.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bfdfe2467e0eb:0xd5c2a691b573b7bb"}

(Employee)\nDate of incident: 2/20/21 - 4:30-5:00pm.\n\n\ud83d\udd25Bought a refurbished starter from there a few years ago. Returned it because it went bad and had a warranty. Did not want to deal with another refurbished starter, so I requested a brand new one. Was told they cannot get a brand new one which is fine. So they told me I could return the defective refurbished starter I had for a refund so I can use that refund on buying a new starter from another store. At that time, that particular employee was real helpful and kind to me.\n\nThen the incident on 2/20/21 happened when I returned on that date with my defective starter. was dealing with the store manager Mike and his employee Thomas D. at the time. I was told that the starter needed to test bad in order for me to get a refund which is fine, because I had my mechanic test the starter beforehand and I recorded a video as evidence. After waiting a good few minutes because it seemed like something was wrong with the machine, the store manager Mike comes out and says that the starter tested good, but that he would still honor the refund. I told him that's fine, but the starter should have tested bad because my mechanic already tested it and I watched him test it, so I pretty much told Mike that the machine is to blame, then he got defensive and rude with his tone of voice about the machine clearly stating that the machine was not incorrect. To avoid further debating, I directly said to just do the refund. His attitude regarding the situation was unprofessional and unacceptable.\n\nWhat makes the situation even worse is the fact that the employee Thomas D. asked me for my driver's license on returning the defective starter which should not have happened, because I have my receipt. When I asked him why he's asking for my driver's license, he said they were supposed to do that on returns, but that's obviously not true. Something didn't feel right, so I called another advance Auto parts store about the situation and that store told me that advance auto of Enterprise were in the wrong for taking my driver's license. My driver's license has the address to my Mother's home because it's an old address and I am not comfortable with that address being on file because I'm protective of my mother and concerned for her safety. I do not trust people I don't know, and I definitely do not trust that advance Auto parts store anymore and ever again.\n\nThey acted very shady and I felt discriminated because I'm part Asian. I've been shopping there off and on for years for myself and for my Mother. As of now, I am no longer a customer and I want my information out of that system immediately. Yes, I got my refund, but I shouldn't have had to go through that much trouble to get it, or feel that uncomfortable. Everything that happened that day was pretty much recorded on my phone along with two eyewitnesses that were with me in case I need them for future reference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617481519561, "text": "Hello KJ, thank you for leaving your comments about your visit to our Enterprise location.

Returned with a bill and bunch of excuses and no fix just a misdiagnosis.\n\nCalled the team from Jimmy's to sort out. They accommodated a time that worked for me to bring the boat in.\n\nIn a few short minutes had an initial diagnosis.

I went here in June and spoke with Ben about correcting an issue that was caused at another car audio place.\n\nBen assured me that it would be an easy fix and told me to come by the following week. I called one day that next week and Ben said that they were too busy on that particular day. I asked if I could just make an appointment instead. Ben said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m kinda tied up right now. Try us again later this week.\u201d\n\nI was in the area the following week so I went by. After greeting me, Ben remembered me and immediately told me that they couldn\u2019t get to my car that day. I told him that I wasn\u2019t expecting a same-day service. I, instead, wanted to make an appointment. Ben thanked me for coming by and told me that the shop had been so busy.\n\nHe, again, assured me that the shop could easily correct the problem. He went on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s really a five-minute fix. I could do it now, but I don\u2019t want to just in case something happens and makes it longer than that and throw our day off.\u201d\n\nMy appointment was set for Wednesday, July 8th at 9:30am. I used PTO at work so that I could finally get the issue taken care of. The evening before my appointment, Ben called and told me they would have to cancel (not reschedule) my appointment because they didn\u2019t get a chance to finish a car from the previous day. He went on to say that they could probably do it at \u201csome other time\u201d and he\u2019d call me to let me know when. Of course, I was never called.\n\n\u2022Why would you tell your customer that you\u2019re too busy to give them an appointment? Especially when there are others working in the office.\n\n\u2022Why are you making the customer chase you as if this is the only place that could correct the issue?\n\n\u2022I understand that the shop may have been busy, or behind schedule. Why not reschedule my appointment?\n\n\u2022If you did not want to (or could not) perform the work, you should\u2019ve been upfront. It was a waste of both of our time.\n\nThis is the second Jimmy\u2019s Car Stereo location I\u2019ve had a poor experience at.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c17a0d019b:0x6ae2aef67374d317"}

Years ago, I told the cashier I had a Cutlass, and he asked me what the make was. I told him, \"Dude, it's a Cutlass. It's an Oldsmobile.\" His response to me was, and I'm dead serious, \"Sorry man, cars aren't really my thing.\u201d\n\nBack in February, I needed a new alternator. Super simple, easy to find part, never had any trouble getting one for this car. Round one, the one they sold me was clocked wrong. We tried to clock it ourselves, because my car was immobilized 1hr 30min away and I didn't want drive to the nearest NAPA to return it. Well we took it apart wrong and broke all the wires.\n\nI took it back and explained what happened. They told me they couldn't do a warranty swap because I broke it. Which I'm sure is technically correct, but also a really bad way to handle it since the part they sold me was wrong, and I had the old one when they sold it to me. Two separate cashiers looked at the old one and the new one side by side and sold it to me anyway.\n\nI just bought a new one instead of fighting it for round 2. The guy that sold me the second one accidentally just gave it to me, assuming it was a warranty replacement, AND refunded me on my card, so I actually made money on this transaction. Which is a good thing because this one immediately whined because it had bad bushings straight out of the box.\n\nRound 3, I gave up and gave an auto shop a ton of money to buy one from a specialty shop already clocked and install it for me, because a 15 minute home repair was taking a week.\n\nA week or so, another shop thought they discovered a radiator leak (I later found out the top hose was just loose and spraying coolant, so this is all really ironic). I went back to NAPA and asked for advice. Fatal mistake.\nOne of the guys, and he's super nice but dumb as a box of rocks when it comes to cars, sold me some Radiator Stop Leak. I also bought some other radiator additive that supposedly helps rejuvenate the o-rings or something. Not sure how that is possible for something that doesn't actually go inside the cylinders, but this guy works at NAPA so I'm sure he's got this.\n\nHe tells me I can dump both of them into the radiator and it will be fine. I follow his advice and read the instructions on the bottle. The system had just been flushed and filled, and the radiator and water pump are less than 5 years old. I let the car idle for 15 minutes and run the heater full blast.\n\nI drive the car for 30 seconds and the hot light comes on, and the shift point for first gear has shifted up. I drive it to the shop and the guy immediately tells me I ruined my coolant system, and probably cooked the transmission, because Radiator Stop Leak is garbage and it does damage. They had to take the radiator out and all the hoses off and blow them out by hand, because the system was so clogged up they couldn't even flush it out with the radiator machine. It cost me $371.\n\nSo these $20 additives clogged up my cooling system to the tune of $371, and now I need a new transmission to the tune of $3,000. My car is parked because it will be at least 2 years before I can afford to fix it.\n\nRadiator Stop Leak essentially laughed at me on Twitter, and I don't have the receipt anyway, AND NAPA DOES NOT ARCHIVE RECEIPTS. They have computers, but I guess they just don't save them on purpose. I can get an archived receipt from Guitar Center for a windscreen I bought in 2006.\n\nAnyway, these employees are all super nice and they try to be helpful, but do not listen to them because they are all dumb as hell.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1523613141009, "text": "Thank you for the review, Jon Would you mind letting us know more by emailing customersupport@napaonline.com so we can try and help?
