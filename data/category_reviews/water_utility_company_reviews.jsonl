Box 1246, Bessemer AL. 35020\n\nDear Madam:\nI am writing to dispute a billing error in the amount of $1,148.05 on my account. This amount is egregious and boldly inaccurate, because I have not resided at the above property since July 31, 2016. It is in your billing responsibilities to have contacted me prior to 3 years after the delinquency.\nIt also states in your Bessemer Utilities Code of Ordinance , Code 1995; Ord. No. 2425; Section #110-51 Billing; line (h) and (i)\n(h)  A notice will be mailed no earlier than two business days after the due date advising the customer that their bill has not been paid. This notice will advise the customer that the late charge has been added and that an additional ten days has been granted.\n(i)  If the bill is not paid, service will be discontinued. Such notice shall contain instructions on how to apply for a hearing if the bill is disputed or if the customer is in financial distress and unable to pay the bill. If the customer fails to respond either with payment or by notifying the utility, disputing the amount of the bill, or by advising the office of the customer's inability to pay, service will be discontinued as scheduled.\nI have printed confirmation from USPS showing that I had a change of address active with priority forwarding  from 8/31/16-8/31/17. During this time I never received ANY correspondence from Bessemer Utilities.\nI also find it Unbelievable and Incredulous that Bessemer Utilities would allow a customer 11 months of service without payment, prior to disconnecting service. Especially when your code of ordinance states otherwise.\nMeanwhile you have been billing the current owner of the residence, an acquaintance of mine, as well.\nI am requesting that the error be corrected, that any finance and/or charges related to the disputed amount including my $300+ deposit be credited back to me immediately.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888de264d0e85a7:0x3bd37d0f7e68f65e"}

So, once asked why can't they knock on the doors of the consumers whose water they turn-off, consumers are told that this company does not have time to do that; but they do have time to cut off water in over \"300\" homes in the city of Harvest every single month. A couple of months ago, a consumer's water was intermittently cut off and payment was not due.  When the consumer called, Cheryle answered very rudely with, \"Hey\" as though she wanted to verbally assault the consumer who was understandably upset about the trickling of no faucet water coming out. For over 10 minutes no water came out of the consumers spigot. When the water did resume, it was brown similar to the water of Michigan state consumers and the household members have been ill every since with bleeding, exhaustion and the like and the household members don't even drink the water from the faucet which could possibly and reasonably lead to death. However, when their pets do, the pets start to make hacking sounds and inadvertently throw-up. Therefore, as a test for water poisoning and tampering the consumer put a specimen into a water bottle with faucet water and watered the outside plants only to find that the plants died. By the way, once the consumer called about the water and was told that someone would be sent out to \"blow-out the pipes\".

This is yet another anti-melanated citizen company that is likely a closet ALEC member, if not an open one. They are monsters of inequality. It\u2019s likely that the split of Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority from Huntsville Utilities was due to a need for both entities to further reign in the manipulation of those who are often overlooked. To add insult to injury, it is clear that entities such as Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority hate melanated people and will do anything to assist that person in Washington, DC to push melanated people into the woods much like the Australian Aborigines have been pushed into the wilderness. Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority is definitely not at all for the majority of the citizens of Harvest, Alabama who are the majority of the populaces residing in the area. . Thus, due to astute hatred, in America, and particularly in the South, brutal gouging, absorbent taxation without representation, as well as over-pricing by stores such as the Publix located on Highway 53 engage in hate crimes against many melanated residents. These illegal acts are unconscionable undertakings that have become strongholds. Yet, it is hurting the pocketbooks of the residents. Moreover, utility companies like Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority along with their partners in crime, Huntsville Utilities, are major players in manipulating, harassing, and causing economic hardship to the majority of the people in the Harvest neighborhood.  Somewhere between 100-400 residents have their water disconnected by Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority every month and in doing so, most residents are not in a position to pay the bill along with the absorbent, unfair and illegal fees.  For example, at least Huntsville Utilities employee will knock on the person\u2019s door or leave a door tag advising the resident to pay the bill. Sure, everyone gets a bill and is responsible to pay it in a timely manner. However, life happens and would it hurt to hand a door tag on the door? Apparently this would hurt their evil intentions because the fee will be charged even if the payment is made the day before the disconnect after 4:30 p.m. Still, there is a fee for the disconnection of the service even if the disconnect doesn\u2019t take place for Monrovia Water Authority. On the other hand, Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority simply robs the resident to no end. For instance, the average water bill in Harvest, Alabama is about, let\u2019s say, $30.00 and if the bill is not paid by the date on the reminder pink card, there is a $40 fee plus a 10% of the bill penalty. On top of that, once the non-knocking worker turns off the water of the resident, there is not only the $40.00 fee; but also an after hour fee if the resident calls after 4:30 p.m. c.s.t. to pay the unreasonable bill. Also, it doesn\u2019t matter if the resident pays Online or over the phone, there is still a fee. But, Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority doesn\u2019t keep credit card digits on file. Thank GOD for that because Heaven only knows what could happen. Nevertheless, in order to put a type of payment authorization on file, a resident would need to print off an Online form, complete it with the bank number as well as he routing bank information and. Then, the resident can mail the form in or or bring it in. Either way, it is a grave inconvenience for many neighbors to do any extra duties, especially the ones who are older, incapacitated or somehow restricted. Moreover, most residents are better off not ever putting a credit card on file since there is so much fraud, tampering and commingling of funds.\nThis review could go on and on with instances of bad practices from the likes of entities like Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority et al However, just beware of such predatory practices by companies such as Harvest-Monrovia Water Authority and speak up for those who are unable to speak up for themselves before you are not able to speak at all\u2122.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88625d2933861a81:0xc0c77d7df4abe968"}
