Apparently they have discontinued the Mexican pizza. The Mexican pizza was one of the only things in the menu unique to the chain. Everything else is better at a sit down Mexican restaurant. Now my decision to eat here will only be for quick food when I can not sit down at a restaurant.  This decision will cut my visits to Taco Bell by 70%. I use to go to Taco Bell 3+ times a week. Thank god for the party pack nachos, while they last. For today my money went to Jacks :(\n\nI can only imagine someone did not do a proper cost benefit analysis on this decision. While it may look like they lost out in a Mexican pizza sale. In reality the Mexican pizza was my reason for stoping at Taco Bell. This was the unique item I could not get anywhere else. Once I was at the window for a Mexican pizza I would then add on the other 6-7 dollars Of menu items. I definitely do not crave an over priced taco or a burrito that has all beans..", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608330711769, "text": "We are very sorry about this!

The people who ordered before me had time to eat and leave and be gone for 5 min before I got my food. The entire wait for my food there were 2 toddlers running around the dine in area screaming. It appeared that the cashier was babysitting this toddlers. She kept leaving the register to tend to them and give them drinks. That was very unacceptable. I ordered this for dine in but after being in the restaurant for 20 min I was tired of hearing 2 kids screaming and running around I asked them to give me the food to go. I get back to work to eat and the quesadilla was not properly cooked and just fell apart. I will never go back. And as an engineer I hope fast food workers are replaced with efficient equipment.
