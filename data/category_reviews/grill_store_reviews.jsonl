Marquez was extremely helpful!  I can't rave about him enough.  My issue came when I was told my dishwasher was in stock in Bham but due to the holidays their 1 installer wouldn't be able to install until after all the holidays.  Okay, I understood the desire to take a break and be with family.  After January 4th I still never heard from anyone to schedule my install.  I finally called on January on January 8th to track down someone to help get this installed.  They were able to come install my dishwasher on the 13th.  The gentlemen that installed my NEW Bosch dishwasher made me aware that the 3rd row was shipped with broken clips so it wouldn't work but that's okay they would have someone come right back out to fix the issue.  After several days of no communication I once again called the store and was told oh yea Shane can come out on January 25th.  Great! Finally I will be able to use my new dishwasher properly.  Shane arrives on the 25th with a 3rd row for the dishwasher.  He was NOT informed properly of the problem and only had the drawer itself.  So once again Im left with a dishwasher that can not be utilized to the fullest.  Shane tells me he will go back to the shop and grab the clips off of another dishwasher and be back to fix the issue.  I wait and wait.  I finally get a hold of Mike on February 5th.  He informs me that the job has been listed as complete!!!  There was no order to get new clips there was nothing listed as needing to still be fixed.  Mike tells me that he will call me back before the end of day OR call me on Monday February 8th to tell me what can be done.  Again, I wait!  I called today the 12th a FULL MONTH after my dishwasher was installed.  Mike tells me oh those clips are on back order.  I asked for some type of date as to expect them he states could be end of February.\nMy issue is the POOR COMMUNICATION!!!!   1st. the installer NEVER reported the correct issue with my dishwasher had he done so properly Shane would never have come to my house with the wrong part.  2nd Shane completed the job.  This is a HUGE FAIL!!!  3rd. Mike never contacted me to let me know there is no part readily available and it will be back ordered.  When I reached out as I've had to do every since they took my money back in December Mike acted a little confused to why I would be calling.\n\nI expect better when paying for a top of the line appliance.  I've gotten better service from a big box store!  I understand parts get broken in the box and no one is aware but this should've been taken care of in January! This was NOT a warranty issue as it was delivered to me broken!!! The product was not ever used.  I am NOT happy that I will have to wait until March to fully use my dishwasher the proper way.  The whole reason I came to All South was the earliest Bob Wallace could get the dishwasher installed was March 4th!!!  If I had known I would be stuck until March to begin with I would've gave Bob Wallace my money!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b91b8998ea1:0x1c5adc2f08bde249"}

All they had to do was install three appliances.  THREE.  The only thing these jag-offs got right was the delivery of the appliances and *sliding in* our new oven.  The dishwasher and microwave were both dropped.  This was obvious because (a) we saw the palette in our garage prior to installation, (b) one side of the palette was \"injured\", (c) the corresponding sides of the appliances from that side of the palette were both broken.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they didn't use the granite counter installation kit for the dishwasher.  This would help considering they don't want to fix the broken feet.  Now, when you open a loaded dishwasher, the whole machine rotates thereby \"dishcharging\" the bottom rack of dishes out onto your floor.  This is entertaining to guests.\n\nThe microwave is also fun.  The plate does not rotate properly so you can always tell when it's in use because of the \"thump-thump\" made by the turntable, much like a broken record but without the repetitive music.  Also, the clock is crooked so you can't tell if it's AM or PM (which actually matters during the winter when it's dark at 5AM and 5PM).  And the oven vent built into the microwave is broken so it slides right out after only unfastening two screws when it should be held together by four screws.  The other two take bits of the broken plastic housing with them.\n\nNormally I wouldn't care because these appliances are \"builder grade\" but it's the principle of the matter.  Allsouth is not interested in fixing or replacing the appliances which can be done EXTREMELY EASILY when you're a flippin' vendor.  They're only interested in minimalist work, single trips, and offering to \"send out an inspector\" which was already been done by the builder who verified that the pieces are indeed broken.  We're guessing Allsouth doesn't trust the builder that hired them in the first place.  They also will not come out on your time, only their time, so if you work and are busy from 8am to 5pm, you can bet you'll never see nor hear from them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b91b8998ea1:0x1c5adc2f08bde249"}

In beginning, the staff were extremely polite, courteous , knowledgeable  and pleasant to interact with. We picked out the pattern we wanted, and paid 50% of the total cost, to cover the  price of manufacturing the liner which, was very reasonable indeed. Steve came out in late December, to take the measurements of the pool, to pass onto the liner manufacturer. We then agreed to call Anders Pool, early March, to set a date to install the liner. I called Anders Pool, March 9th, and spoke with Steve, and set the date to install the new liner on Wednesday, March 27th. Steve touched base with me, a few days before the install date, to make sure we were good to go. Chris and two other staff, arrived early Wednesday, and drained the pool with a gas pump. They removed the old liner, thoroughly, and I mean thoroughly, cleaned, the pool walls and floors, smoothed over the pool floor and installed the new liner without any issues at all. Then, they set up a vacuum pump and a set a vacuum hose between the pool wall and the pool liner, to suck the trapped air out as we filled the pool from the faucet. The Anders pool liner installers, were extremely Professional and polite throughout the entire operation. They did a fantastic job, far, far, better than their local competition, that I'd used for the two previous liners, over the past 30 years. This liner fits snuggly up against the 4 ft. radius walls of the pool. Anders Pool, took the time, to accurately measure the pools dimensions. The previous pool company, when measuring up, rounded down the measurements, to get an even number. Which, resulted in a poor fitting liner. If you need a new pool liner, make sure you get a quote from Anders Pool Company. Trust me, they'll get you the best price and, the best quality liner, and the best possible installation.

I continued to check on it day after day and about a week later when I googled the Jenome 3000 Ken's Sewing center changed it from \"out of stock\" to \"IN STOCK\" I immediately added it to my cart and checked out. 2 weeks pass and I called to check my order status and the lady in the phone says \"sir, this was a pre-order\" I argued and told her I would never have bought it if it was a pre-order. She says yes sir it clearly says pre-order. I checked my receipt, and no where did it specify that this was a pre-order. I googled Jenome 3000 and again it clearly says \"IN STOCK\". So I called again to speak with a manager and the secretary tells me he's busy and she could help me, I explained the story and she tells me, \"yes sir, it does say IN STOCK, but if you scroll down to the details it does say it's a pre-order, and she was right. BUT THIS IS CLEARLY A BAIT AND SWITCH CON. I didn't scroll down because I already researched the machine and the website allowed me to purchase the machine from start to finish, including my receipt, without EVER clearly stating it was a pre-order. The status said \"processing\" not \"pre-order. No where other than the details did it specify that the machine was on back order and now they tell me it will ship JULY 27. Thats a 2 month processing time and they're trying to trick people by changing the status to \"IN STOCK\". That's false advertising and now they put me 2 weeks behind getting another machine for my wife's business. Completely unprofessional and tricky. I don't care if your website doesn't allow for the status to only read \"in stock\" or \"out of stock\" They should leave it \"OUT OF STOCK\" and put in the details that customers can call for a PRE-ORDER.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48cec32d1629:0x37e6ea59d2d2ff03"}

What I didn't notice is that the listing on Ken's website included some extra feet that were not in the Amazon listing - this was MY mistake. Kind of makes sense, since Ken's needs to pay Amazon a commission.\n\nMy wife called to inquire, and the woman at Ken's who answered the phone (no phone menu, no transfer, no \"I need to ask my manager\") quickly said that she understood how we could have misunderstood the listing difference, and that she would send the extra feet free of charge. They just arrived today, 3 business days later.\n\nI'm kind of impressed that Ken's made us whole on something that after all, was our mistake. Next time, I will definitely deal directly with Ken's and cut out the (Amazon) middleman. I'm really impressed and would recommend Ken's to anyone out there.\n\nEd", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48cec32d1629:0x37e6ea59d2d2ff03"}

The website says it has excellent service, but Donna and Kevin (owner?) are really unprofessional. Long story short, I received two defective machines and now they have everything back and don't want to give me my money back. The way Donna handles \"customer service\" is to hang up the phone on you and tell everyone to not answer your calls and not respond to emails. When she does decide to respond via email after writing many times, she doesn't solve the problem, she just causes more and doesn't sign off. The way Kevin \"solves problems\" is to lie and make up whatever is convenient for him. Have him email you so he cannot go back on his words.\n\nupdate: RELUCTANTLY, they sent me a third machine that I did NOT want. YES, I had to pay for shipping. The second one was broken within a month and I have email proof that I informed them at that time. I tried to save them money and have them send me a piece and change that to see it that is what was broken. Of course it was over a month by then and hard to contact them so they wanted me to pay for shipping. I had no choice b/c they wouldn't give me a refund for the broken machines they sent me. This was after months of them not refunding me my money & having possession of their machine. Donna was extremely unprofessional and childish. To expand on what I wrote above, she would hang up the phone on you and then when I try to call numerous times, she wouldn't pick up. I would then call with a different phone and then, wah-lah, she is magically answering the phone again. Who does that? Then Kevin gets the phone and has the nerve to tell me I hung up the phone. If I hung up, why would I have tried calling back several times to no avail? Kevin kept giving me the run around and wouldn't let me talk to the owner. I asked him NUMEROUS times to give me the same order when he shipped it, yet when I received it, the threads I had chosen were not included. The ugliest colors they could find were thrown into the package they sent me. I am so tired of dealing with them, I didn't even bother to contact them.\n\nBuyer beware!

I called the store this time and they wanted me to uninstall everything and just give me a whole new one which i stated that I couldn't do that because i paid someone to connect everything which would mean that i would have to pay them again. She stated that they couldn't help me with that. I finally convinced them to just order the storage shelve that was dented and it would maybe take 2 months. At this point Im like whatever. They get me to Chris the appliance guy and he states that they have a whole unit in stock and they would deliver that shelve to me the next day. I was happy and ready to put this behind me. If only it was that easy. Chris stated that someone would call me the next morning to inform me of the time frame that day for delivery. They never called or showed up. That was Monday.

Over the past several years, my husband and I have purchased several large appliances. All of which were a nightmare of an experience.  No communication about delivery and expectations once your item is paid for. No delivery confirmations/calls from the \"warehouse\". The first items were a washer and dryer and fridge - they showed up 2 days late. Frustrating considering we needed the items urgently AND we took time off to be there at delivery time. Most recent was a dishwasher. The man in the back who sold us the dishwasher seemed like he would rather be anywhere BUT work. Honestly, we would have walked right out if it wasn't for the fact that I had some rewards to use at Lowes. He gave no information and in fact, told me I should \"search online and compare dishwashers\" because he wasn't an expert and didn't have a say on any of them. Then we asked about delivery. He had no info - not even on the process and we explained we had a bad experience before. Instead of sticking up for or explaining to us that maybe it was a fluke, he went on to talk about the \"warehouse\" and how many complaints they get on them. Not very reassuring. Our dishwasher didn't show up today so we will be canceling our order and we just opened a Home Depot account - so Lowes, you have lost a customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889048d83ba7ea7:0x35de940e38e1b1d2"}

We went in to return a work desk that he had purchased yesterday, only to come home and find out that pieces are broken and missing. When we arrived at the return desk we were greeted angrily by a lady named Shelia (her tag said CSA Front Desk). She was in the process of helping another gentleman with a wheelbarrow at the time we arrived so I shrugged her attitude off as frustration to begin with. By the time she got to us she took the receipt from my husband, asked angrily what was wrong to which he informed her that the desk portion (the main part of the item) was broken down the middle and pieces were missing. She rolled her eyes, mumbled a few things, then started to walk away and as she was walking into another room yelled back at us \"you know it's a clearance item right?!\"  She then came back out of that room, struggled to get the lid off the box and then continued to tell us in a displeasing tone that our kobalt work desk was on clearance. I then stated \"so does clearance mean that pieces are broken? If so, lowes should not be selling clearance items\". She then argued with me that clearance items are usually returns with missing pieces and I restated that the main portion of the item is completely broken in half. I don't care if it's clearance or not, it was not marked down nearly enough to compensate for a complete useless, damaged piece. She then slammed a refund receipt down and asked my husband to sign. She never asked if we wanted to swap it with a usable piece. She never asked anything, actually. During this entire transaction she was rude and everything anyone in customer service should not be. She was also complaining and cussing under her breath about no one answering the phone around there during our entire few minutes with her. When we were leaving there were 2 more men waiting patiently behind us and just staring in disbelief at what they witnessed and would unfortunately encounter. I told one man good luck as we walked off and he said it looked like he needed it. Needless to say, if lowes in fultondale is going to hire individuals of her caliber, we will not step foot back in that store and may in fact just take our business to Home Depot.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889048d83ba7ea7:0x35de940e38e1b1d2"}

Finally when we ordered the cabinets a few weeks later, we were told it would take 30 days to get them in and possibly a week extra to get them installed. Two days before we were supposed to get the cabinets in we received an email from the man we was working with stating that he was sorry, the order was incorrect and said he was leaving that he couldn't help us any longer. Well 3 cabinets were missing, and was measured incorrectly...... AGAIN. Don is the assistant manager over there and is terrible. We met with him and got another person to come measure... again and said we had to wait another 30days before it could be here and another 1-2weeks to install. Well the installer said when they got here he couldn't finish the trim because something was not finished. Don has told us from the start that we would sit down and discuss what needs to be done to make this right. I have called lowes 20 times and got Don at least 10 and said he would call me back. HE NEVER DOES. I have asked for the store manager Jeff left messages, still no answer. We have been dealing with this for 6 months and spent a lot of money for a normal person.
