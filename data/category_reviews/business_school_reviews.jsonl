This is such an amazing place right here in the heart of Decatur, AL!  I have several friends who work for the ECenter and many who rent space for their personal business within the ECenter. This is the place for people to be Encouraged, Enthused and Empowered as Entrepreneurs. You will not regret taking the Business 101 Course as a small business owner, someone just getting started or even just wanting to learn the basics. Larry Waye, Director of Business Development and Education, is phenomenal. I highly recommend getting to know what all the Decatur-Morgan County Entrepreneurial Center has to offer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862841ff76171e1:0xa02be62790ba7730"}
