They deserve nothing, I went to fill my taxes for the first time as a independent contractor not only did they not tell me I didn't make the threshold to even have to file. They filed my paper work anyway and charged it as the most important form and then took half of my money. 800 they took 400 its important beacuse when I went back to do an amended return that they told me they would do for free. I remember because they had to call corporate and ask what to do. They decided when I went back to charge me a full 175 for something they told me was free. I got upset and left days later when I was forced to retrieve the rest of the amended money I was promised beacuse of other circumstances I gave into my pride and filed not only am I still waiting on my money since January which is unfair. THEY ALSO amended almost a whole 2,000 back from me so yeah I was supposed to have around 2,800 the first time. NOT WORTH IT ALL OF THEM!!. And then when they mess up apparently it's free?????

It is our policy to deduct the costs of tax prep from whichever return (federal or state) is received first when the costs are deducted from your refund vs paid for up front at time of service. Regarding your anticipated refund, the quickest and most accurate source for updates on your federal refund status will continue to be the IRS 'Where's My Refund' tool available here: https://www.irs.gov/refunds\n\nIf it's been over 21 days since the IRS has accepted your return, and their 'Where's My Refund' tool doesn't reflect an updated status, we recommend reaching out to them directly for the most accurate update on your refund. They are available 7am-7pm EST Monday - Friday at 800-829-1040, though please note that hold times appear to be shorter for those calling earlier rather than later in the day. I hope the information helps to clarify on the time frame for processing, though please give us a call at 800-234-1040 if we can address any additional questions or concerns, we value the opportunity to be of service. - Jen, Jackson Hewitt Care Team"}, "gmap_id": "0x888a3b54a967128b:0x5bcfdba5ba68dc0f"}

BB updated on a daily basis as Washington worked through passing emergency bills for financial relief, tax extensions and countless modifications to say the least. Not only did BB update, but it was spelled out clearly in plan terms. With the constant flood of information in news and social media, it\u2019s hard not to get overwhelmed. Thankful for the public service in which BB provided throughout these uncertain times.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43bc8d67724d:0xa06f233aff6e29e"}
{"user_id": "114346011849293475879", "name": "Joe Shiver", "time": 1590008848385, "rating": 1.0, "text": "They prepared our taxes. They put the wrong social on some paperwork but not all so the return got kicked back. I was able to get passed that. Once Re-submitted I followed up via email asking if they had re-mailed our amended return also. No response. Called after a month (now over 3 months after they initially did the return) and figure out that they had not mailed out amended return in the first place. Horrible communication and feel like just another customer that they could care less about.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590073930099, "text": "Mr. Shiver,\n\nMy name is Rachel Byers and I am one of the Partners here at Byers, Byers, and Associates P.C.  First and foremost, I am very sorry you had a bad experience with our firm. We strive to provide high quality and outstanding service to our clients. We sincerely apologize for any miscommunications. In the extremely rare event that we have an unhappy customer, it is our policy to have a partner that was not involved in the preparation of your tax return review your file. As such, I have been selected as the \u2018Monitoring Partner\u2019 for your case.\n\nAfter review, I have a clear understanding of your situation and wanted to provide some insight into a few things. As you can imagine, there are occasions where hand-written figures can be read incorrectly. Sometimes a 1 looks like a 7 or a 4 looks like a 9. This happens. When we release a return to be E-filed, each SSN on the return has to match the SSN and associated name in the IRS database. If it does not, we get a rejection notice from the IRS (and the associated State) letting us know why it was rejected. We make the quick correction to the digit and re-release the file for electronic acceptance. This is usually a very quick and painless fix. Unfortunately, your situation hit a small speed bump in that process. The State of Alabama accepts electronically filed returns, but only as a \u201cpiggy back\u201d to the federal return. That is, we have to release the state return with the federal return. When we received the rejection from the IRS about the social, we immediately reviewed the tax documents provided to see if we could identify the error and found the issue. Without hesitation, we corrected the number and re-released the return. However, it seems we did that too quickly for our software. Since the state had not officially \u2018rejected\u2019 the original return we submitted, it did not allow another submission to the state until that happened. The state rejection came a few hours after we re-released the return. We were unaware the corrected state filing was never received by the state E-filing system. This has NEVER happened to us before. When it was uncovered that the state filing had not been accepted, we reached out to our software developers for guidance and they quickly fixed the issue and the problem was resolved.\nI sincerely apologize for the delay in processing your return. This truly was a unique situation that we had not faced and have spoken with out software developers about it.\n\nAs it relates to your amended returns from a prior year, it seems that there was a miscommunication somewhere. We prepared the returns and provided all preparer signatures, filing instructions, and pre-addressed envelopes. Since amended returns have to be paper filed, they require physical signatures from the preparer, taxpayer, and spouse. We typically offer to mail the returns for a client if they are able to sign the returns when they pick them up. However, since I was not there and our front office manager is no longer with us, I cannot comment on what was advised when the amended return was picked up. Based on your discussion with the preparer about having the envelopes attached to the preparer-signed returns in your possession and our priority mailing records, it doesn\u2019t appear that we mailed that return for you. I am VERY sorry for any miscommunication related to this. Rest assured, we will discuss communicating clear instructions to clients at our next team meeting.\n\nAgain, I apologize you had a bad experience. I did want to take a moment to thank you for your professionalism and character. Every staff member that had communications with you said that you were very nice and cordial. I know how frustrating financial matters can be, and it says a lot about you and your character that you maintained your professionalism. So, thank you for that.\nWe wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors and would be happy to work with you again.\n\nBest Regards,\nMonitoring Partner at BB&A"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a43bc8d67724d:0xa06f233aff6e29e"}
