Nigel and Leilani run the store and are two of my favorite people. They get to know their customers very well and it makes the atmosphere feel like you're walking in to a good friends house to play the day away with some Smash Bros or Halo.\n\nLeilani makes the best tacos I have ever had in my life. If you get the chance, go to Taco Tuesday. You won't regret it. In fact all the food is delicious. An order of double fries or nachos goes perfect with a D&D session.\n\nNigel has the uncanny ability to bring fun wherever he goes. He's set up the cafe to accommodate nearly any genre of nerd from retro gamers to hardcore tournament competitors. He's also constantly working to improve his business and make sure everyone that walks in the door has a great time. He also runs a pretty dope YouTube channel called Nerd Torch TV.\n\nThe store is organized and managed extremely well. There are several rooms dedicated to different types of gaming. There is a room for tabletop games, another for rhythm games like Guitar Hero or DDR, and other rooms dedicated to console games. There's even a PC built for gaming. Multiplayer games are very popular and this is a great place to find people that love to play Smash. I don't think I've ever been to the cafe when there wasn't someone playing Smash or Mario Cart. There's a great community built up around the cafe as well. All of the cafe members are invited to a GroupMe chat where you can get updates on events or just chat and hang out. This year, they organized a secret santa for everyone.\n\nIf you love games, nerds, and having a good time then you won't be dissapointed if drop by NERDtorch Cafe.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1514529783552, "text": "Thanks so much for writing such a detailed description of NERDtorch Cafe!
