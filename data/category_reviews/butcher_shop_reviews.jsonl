Fresh vegetables and any type of infused olive oils you can imagine.  The cheese display is incredible, and the staff is more than happy to give you a sample of any you would like to try.  Let's not forget the meat!  You can see the dry aging of beef in process.  It takes about thirty days to age the beef.  I bought a ready to cook meal that includes chunks of prime beef, carrots, onions, celery, potatoes, a half bulb of garlic, tomato paste and a red wine jus.  Cooked it in my dutch oven, and it was perfect.  I didn't have to cut up the vegetables or meat, so it was a great time-saver.  Did I mention the filets?  Bought two dry-aged and they grill to fork tender.  The flavor is certainly better than regular filets from the grocery store.  All meat is butchered in-house, by well-trained chefs and the house-made sausage is unique, yes classic.  I also bought pork chops that must have been over an inch thick.\nI highly recommend you buy from this specialty food store!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517078292301, "text": "Lorraine, thank you SO MUCH for your incredibly kind words.
