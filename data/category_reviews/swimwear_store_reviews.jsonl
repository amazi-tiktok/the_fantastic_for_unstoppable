When I went to try on stuff, which I was iffy about (covid-19), but I have to try on certain stuff. At first i was the only one in the store for a little while before a second person came in, I asked about the dressing room, girl went in to clean it sanitize which I appreciate. But if I\u2019m about to buy something & I\u2019m trying it on why is the staff asking how long I got in the dressing room she knocked on door more than once , like was there a time limit or something? she kept asking me other people need to try on stuff I\u2019m thinking like it\u2019s about 4 other rooms & then they told me once I go in I can\u2019t go in but once.  With that being said I made sure that I took in all what I could & wanted to purchase. Like don\u2019t rush I\u2019m trying multiple pieces, come out it\u2019s like one person with two other people sitting including a man, which he is not trying on stuff waiting. Manager kept making small comments to staff hardly spoke when I came in....I wanted to give them a piece of my mind but wasn\u2019t worth my time,  hence store was only open about 45 mins when I arrived so I don\u2019t want to hear anything about a long day. Would have never went into store but shop online but I needed something I didn\u2019t want to wait To ship only to arrive with limited selection.
