We set up a tee time the day before for Saturday. We traveled about 40 mins to the course. It was right off the highway into a gated golf community. Right from the start we were greeted by the staff. Upon entering the clubhouse, I was amazed at the initial set up of the course. My co-worker had to rent some clubs, at which they were very accommodating by giving him a brand new set of Nike Vapors. I had the Coverts 2.0 from the previous year and was impressed at the rentals they provided. We went to the driving range and then the putting green and we were off. Long story short, the course was AWESOME and the view was even better. We found ourselves stopping to take pictures and taking in the view (Which I rarely do on course). What I thought was to be a 6 hr round (because of our relax play at each hole) was a little over 4 hrs. This course is in my TOP 5 best courses I've played in my life, (I've played in the range of 50-60 different courses). I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys a challenge, but also a forgiving course layout. The scenic views are something out of a movie which as to the relaxation of the game of golf. If you are ever in the area, you have to check out this course.\n\nA big Thank You to the staff there at Cherokee Ridge who were some of the top notch personnel a course can have.

I went out to the course and spoke to the gentlemen about the incident.  They were delayed only 5 minutes from their tee time.  My worker could have had a cooler head dealing with customers, but an apology was made and the men appeared to be happy that I looked into the situation. I offered to buy them a round of beers as a friendly gesture.   I am more than willing to accept a one star review than cower to a person trying to extort money in lieu of a bad review.

I purchaced two fairway woods, a putter and a new Bag during my last visit. The cashier charged me twice for the woods....when i questioned it he acted like a jerk and started talking under his breath. I showed him on the receipt because he said \"no i didn't\". He was to busy chatting with another employee behind the counter to do his job. No big deal the guy just sucks at customer service right. So today I walk in the door at 20 minutes til 6pm. They close at 6pm. I was asked as i walked in the door if I knew what I wanted because they were about to close. Told him i was going to get a new driver needed to get a 10.5 degree. He asked again did i know which one I wanted because they are closing. With a smile i just said no problem I'll go somewhere else.\nI will never spend another dime in this store.\n\nTomorrow I'll drive over to Inverness Golf and pick out my $500 driver for my post father's day gift.\nInverness Golf for me from now on.....don't waste your time or money on these rude idiots.

I wandered in to the PGA Tour Superstore in Inverness.\n\nAs I browsed the store looking at the enormous selection of every kind of equipment I became so overwhelmed. Thankfully a salesperson, Drew, found me. Bless him, he was so patient as I described my predicament. He helped me find the right clubs, bag, shoes, towel, and all the other things a new golfer needs.  He was also patient with my need for things to \u201cmatch\u201d lol. Golf is an expensive pastime, but Drew made me confident in my decisions. He shared a lot of information about the local golf scene too.\n\nI will definitively be back, and ask for Drew!
