And honestly it was the best thing for me to do and should have done sooner. I really did enjoy him going to Kiddie Care in the beginning. A couple of months into him going was when the problems started. Teachers were not consistent in the class rooms. It seemed like there was a new teacher in the class room every few weeks. The classrooms are over-crowded with kids. I had problems with a couple of his teachers. One of them told him that he could lay in his urine after he told her that he had wet himself at nap time. I told the co-director and she did write the teacher up and moved my child to a different class. And recently I learned that at times when kids are eating, if they talk, their food gets taken away. There is also a write up system which I think is ridiculous. Most of the write ups were things normal 3 year old boys do. Even his teacher said he\u2019s just being a boy on most of them, yet they write them up anyways. His most recent teacher always seemed to have a bad attitude in the mornings and wasn\u2019t a cheery person whatsoever. The co-director tried helping me with some issues I was having but in the end it just wasn\u2019t enough. My child was not happy going to daycare anymore. He started his new daycare on Monday and I can already tell a difference in him. He\u2019s so much happier when he gets home.

It is important to introduce new skills and concepts in a way that is best for the students to understand and grow their basic working knowledge.

We charge a flat subscription fee no matter the number of weeks included in the month.  Some months had 5 sessions and some had 4 making it even out in the end.

I've had so many problems, just this semester.\nMy school, UAB has started using ProctorU due to the pandemic. Last semester, I had many professors use it, but I found it to be an invasion of privacy. They check your personal information and require you to unplug your second monitor if you have one. They also have asked me to remove items off my desk, such as calenders and even flowers.\nThis semester, the only class of mine that used it was my math class. I took an exam a few weeks back last month. The website my tests use for the class messed up and my professor allowed me to reschedule, and ProctorU said I could reschedule for free. They made me pay $12 to reschedule it. Upon rescheduling, they changed proctors in the middle of my exam, and the second proctor couldn't access my camera. They made me stop taking my test and wasted 10 minutes of my time on my test trying to fix it. I had 3 minutes left and almost a fourth of the test left, which resulted in my getting a 73 because I couldn't finish most of those that I had left. After telling my professor, he allowed me to retake it again and even extended the deadline a few days to make sure if I had any more problems, I could sort them out.\nI had my last math test of the year on Monday (not including my final). ProctorU wouldn't allow me to access my exam or anything. I had everything set up and everything, but it kept saying I had an exam in progress, and upon trying their live support, which is actually just a bot with pre-programed responses. It still didn't give me answers and they pretty much said \"You're SOL\" which wasn't nice to hear since it wasn't an issue on my end. I emailed my professor and he is allowing my final to replace that grade that I missed, but I'm scared ProctorU will screw up on my final, and make me fail the class.\nAVOID THIS PROGRAM AT ALL COSTS!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889240f3f539d41:0x40d3939f17f45a0f"}

If no other route is available, strap in and record everything.\n\nOriginal review:\nDon't fall for this scam!

It said it was too loud in a silent room and too dark even though it's extremely well-lit. I immediately took to the tech support at 8:11 and discovered there were two different links to tech support so I went with both. I was chatting with 2 different people simultaneously when one of them disconnected me, and the one who had control of my PC opened a new chat window and connected me to a different chat agent before using my computer to disconnect themselves! Every person I spoke to told me that I'd have to speak with the advocate (they kept saying that) who signed me up, but I signed myself up. They kept trying to pass the blame onto me, but I had been prepared for the exam for days. Every person I spoke to also told me that I was supposed to take the exam 2 days ago and that I had missed my exam date, but I corrected every single person (even the manager) because they were looking at the date I had signed up for the course!!! I asked them to just let me take the exam and they offered to reschedule me for later that night or refund my money. Considering that it took me so long to prep for the exam, I wanted to take it tonight. I asked for a supervisor after 1-1/2 hours, and was told repeatedly that there were no supervisors until the next day. I called their bluff, and after half-an-hour longer a manager came into the chat! Look at that! They do exist! He informed me that they have no way of getting someone into the exam. Seriously. They're only a pair of eyes to watch a person for a few hours. I asked him why their tech support even existed and he couldn't answer. He then said he couldn't reschedule or refund my money.

This not only postponed the exam by two weeks. Even the registration turned out to be difficult because the button to confirm EU citizenship was simply not clickable despite repeated attempts and multiple reloads. After a workaround, there was simply no time to be selected for the selected participation. After finally solving this problem, which the company is aware of, with a lot of trial and error, the next hurdle appeared in the payment process: Payment only possible with a credit card. A chat with customer service did not provide a solution either. So I had to get a credit card first. However, the chosen participation was only reserved for ten minutes, and the organization had announced that booking as early as possible was urgently recommended due to limited places and competitive tests. So it was said for days, trembling, whether there is still a place available until you can pay by card. Both the technology and the customer service of the company are in need of improvement. Hopefully everything will work as it should at least on the exam day in early October.\n\n(Original)\nWegen der Pandemie stellte mein Bildungsanbieter von einer Pr\u00e4senzpr\u00fcfung auf einen Onlinetest mit ProctorU um. Dadurch verschob sich die Pr\u00fcfung nicht nur noch einmal um zwei Wochen. Schon die Registrierung erwies sich als diffizil, weil der Button zur Best\u00e4tigung der EU-B\u00fcrgerschaft trotz wiederholter Versuche und mehrfachen Neuladens einfach nicht klickbar war. Nach einem Workaround war dann als N\u00e4chstes f\u00fcr die ausgesuchte Teilnahme einfach keine Zeit ausw\u00e4hlbar. Nachdem man irgendwann mit viel Rumprobieren endlich auch dieses Problem gel\u00f6st hatte, das dem Konzern bekannt ist, tauchte im Bezahlvorgang schon wieder die n\u00e4chste H\u00fcrde  auf:  Zahlung nur mit Kreditkarte m\u00f6glich. Ein Chat mit dem Kundenservice erbrachte auch keine L\u00f6sung. Also hatte ich mir erst einmal eine Kreditkarte anzuschaffen. Die gew\u00e4hlte Teilnahme blieb aber nur zehn Minuten reserviert, und die Organisation hatte verlauten lassen, wegen begrenzter Pl\u00e4tze und Konkurrenzpr\u00fcfungen sei eine m\u00f6glichst fr\u00fchzeitige Buchung dringend empfohlen. Also hie\u00df es tagelang Zittern, ob bis zur eigenen M\u00f6glichkeit der Kartenzahlung \u00fcberhaupt noch ein Platz frei ist. Sowohl die Technik als auch der Kundenservice des Unternehmens sind stark verbesserungsw\u00fcrdig. Hoffentlich funktioniert wenigstens am Pr\u00fcfungstag Anfang Oktober alles, wie es soll.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889240f3f539d41:0x40d3939f17f45a0f"}

We live in Ohio and are back in Sweet Home Alabama visiting family. We searched online for a fireworks display and our search led us to The American Village. We went a little early and enjoyed seeing the campus and tasting the delights of the food trucks:). Our family of 6 thought it awesome that there were seats if you didn\u2019t bring one or a blanket, picnics are allowed, and staff and volunteers were not only friendly but smiling and seemingly loving their roles!  This isn\u2019t your ordinary history museum and the fireworks display was definitely not typical. My husband is a retired Army Captain with 22 years in service. We have visited many places and viewed many fireworks displays including ones on military posts. None have even come close to what we experienced last night!  My favorite parts, the parts that gave me chills and made tears flow, was seeing the colors presented correctly, the heartfelt gratitude of The American Village staff towards Those who serve, and the accurate depiction of our historical relevance. Thank you American Village for making our Independence Day Celebration not only the best yet, but also helping us to reflect on just how wonderful it is to be an American!  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892951889d4a0d:0xd5b51426974ef905"}

One week he would go to Milestones and catch something, then we would keep him home for a week and fix him up.  The next week he would catch something else again.  It was a perpetual cycle because of which we decided to pull him out.\n\nHe then restarted daycare (somewhere else) when he was a year old.  For 6 months he was relatively healthy - barring the occasional cough / cold.  We started him back at Milestones this week (i.e. 18  months).  He has been there all of 3 days and already he has caught a stomach bug. This place is horrible!  On day 1 when we went to pick him up, his milk cup was not washed and just sitting around.  The second day, his pacifier was missing.  When I asked the teacher where his pacifier was, she started looking among the toys.  That should have been my first clue - if the teacher is looking for a pacifier amongst the toys, god alone knows how many kids have put it in their mouth!  And the pacifier had a string attached to it, so they could just have clipped it to our son, but they did not care to do that.  The \"teachers\" as such are a bunch of college kids, and most of them have no clue what they are doing.

My son has attended two years now and has learned so much! My son started counted his toys in Spanish last night. They offer one on one learning. They have animals and learn how to take care of a garden in the back. They teach the children the most important facts and truly care about the children. I would recommend The Montessori Learning Center to anyone with daycare age children up to 1st grade. They are wanting to expand to 3rd grade students and I really hope they do.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862134da073a3bf:0x87d7f84ae67a656f"}

Don't send your children to the horrible government run schools. The individual attention helps every level of child and you can't and won't get that at public/government school.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862134da073a3bf:0x87d7f84ae67a656f"}

They kicked him out because they said he was too hard to deal with. They said he may have autism but had no evidence other than \"he was hard to deal with\".  He is now in Premier Preschool in Research Park and is much happier. They help him and have professionals come in and evaluate the children. He is a normal 3 year old boy with no problems. The Montessori Learning Center just did not know how to handle him. They are looking for easy kids to watch so they can sit around and collect checks. Would not recommend them after my experience.\n\nI assume the 5 star ratings you are giving yourself are in response to my review. I am sorry if you do not know how to handle children.\n\nIf you are reading this and looking at schools please don't take convenience into account when choosing a school. I drive across town every day to take my son to Premier Preschool and it is 1000 times better for him.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862134da073a3bf:0x87d7f84ae67a656f"}

The Montessori method is truly amazing - it's impressive to see children teach and learn from each other, just like a family.  They serve healthy snacks and use non-toxic cleaning choices.
