Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission. Just be aware.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625061478074, "text": "Hello Mr. Phillis, We're very sorry to learn of your recent move experience.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter. You can reach me at the office @ 251-316-5977 or by email billy.stovall@twomen.com   While we never like to receive poor reviews, we will learn from it and hopefully improve our service to all customers. I appreciate you taking the time to leave it. Billy Stovall - Owner Two Men And A Truck Mobile, AL"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c5600ae3917:0x323715d12942ec3d"}

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission. Just be aware.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625061478074, "text": "Hello Mr. Phillis, We're very sorry to learn of your recent move experience.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind.

Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter. You can reach me at the office @ 251-316-5977 or by email billy.stovall@twomen.com   While we never like to receive poor reviews, we will learn from it and hopefully improve our service to all customers. I appreciate you taking the time to leave it. Billy Stovall - Owner Two Men And A Truck Mobile, AL"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c5600ae3917:0x323715d12942ec3d"}

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

Management team did not always conduct professional business. See below:\n\nWe used Two Men and a Truck back in February. The crew did a decent job overall. They were hard working, the driver, Nate was exceptional. He had a great work ethic and was super professional and led the group.\n\nMy issue is with the management team. There was a discrepancy with the amount of time spent and the amount charged. The driver took off a little time from our final invoice because they spent an hour getting the electric bed upstairs. Essentially what he did was take off the $125 deposit from the quote. I felt like that was fair and I signed the final invoice. At that point I was happy with the move and we went on our merry way.\n\nA few days later, I get an additional $125 charge from them on my credit card. Later that day, the operations manager who I believe his name is Joey, calls me to explain that he charged my card an additional $125 because I was quoted wrong on the final invoice. I explained to him that Nate took the $125 deposit off of the invoice because of the extra time it took them to move things when it shouldn\u2019t have taken that much time. He explained to me that Nate didn\u2019t have that authority and that I will have to pay the $125. I told Joey that I signed the final invoice giving them permission to charge my card for that final amount, in which he has no right to charge my card AGAIN without my permission. He then explained that he felt they have the right. If you give me a final invoice with an amount and I sign it, that is an agreement between the business and the client. A business has no right to change an agreement or amount after it has been signed by both parties. I got a call the next day from another manager to see how the move went. She was very nice and I explained the situation. I explained how I felt I was wronged in that my card was charged again without my permission, how Joey was unprofessional and does not conduct good business. She said that this information would be taken up the chain and people would be made aware. Ultimately nothing was done about it in the end. I just feel like it\u2019s stealing when someone charges your card for an additional amount without permission.

I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don\u2019t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the \u201cheavy\u201d furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor\u2019s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind. This move cost me $750!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625062172220, "text": "We're very sorry to learn of your recent move experience.

While we do have two \"shorter\" trucks in our fleet, it has to do with the height, not the floor space. We did go over on your original estimate by 30 minutes. While we always hope to hit the number spot on, we do sometimes miss and we thoroughly cover and explain to all customers how we bill on actual time used, not the estimate. This was covered in the pre-move email you received on 4/3/2018 and is also covered in item 1 on the Move Service contract that you and all of our customers sign before we begin a move.  Your move notes do say that our men \"did a great job\" but you were frustrated by the second trip that was made. I did not see however in those notes where a meeting was supposed to take place. If this somehow fell through the cracks, I sincerely apologize and will be happy to speak with you personally about the matter.

Two men moved us from a house to an apartment across town, with a pit stop at a storage unit in between, in 2.5 hours. The guys were amazing. When I needed to move a couple weeks ago, due to my great experience previously, I chose to use this company again.\n\nI don't know what has happened in the last 3 years, but I will never use this company again. They sent 3 guys this time, which would make you think it would take less time, right? No. I moved to an apartment that was 2 lights down from my then current apartment, and we again visited the storage unit, which is down the street from the new apartment. We basically went in a quarter mile triangle.  It took these 3 guys over 6 hours to move the contents of a one bedroom apartment and a small storage unit. They knocked off like 45 minutes for the break they took in the middle, so I paid for 5.5 hours total.\n\nYou may be thinking, how much stuff did she buy in that 3 year period?? The only difference between the first time and second time were 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer. With an extra person, they basically took 3 hours to move 2 bookshelves, a chair, and a washer/dryer.\n\nI wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but after watching them visibly hem and haw at moving my stuff, visibly waste my time and money, I just can't. They mentioned that this company is under new ownership, which may be part of the problem. Maybe these guys get commission, I don't know. All I know is that I paid $925 to move a 1 bedroom apartment and a 5x8 storage unit a quarter mile down the road.\n\nDo not use this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479267452136, "text": "Hello Sarah, we are so sorry your experience wasn't what you had expected and didn't live up to the high standards we have at Two Men And A Truck.

I was told that was accurate. When the movers finally arrived, they did not have either furniture or appliance movers, and it was apparent that they had just been assigned the work an hour or so beforehand when I had called for an ETA after the no show. We had a 1,000 square foot, 2 bedroom apartment to load and unload at a house 10 minutes away. We used a 26 foot U-haul truck for the move and only filled it 75% full (packed haphazardly). One of the two small, young men had only been on the job for a few days, and he could not load the larger appliances and furniture. I had to move those items together with the other young man to get them loaded and unloaded. We paid $75 an hour, plus fees. And because of the lack of tools, experience and muscle, the job took 8 hours. I called the company while the job was still ongoing, and was given a 1.5 hour discount (then charged twice for a one-time \"travel fee\"). I've moved numerous times in the past when I was on active duty in the Marine Corps, and had three times as much stuff loaded in half the time. What a stressful, expensive nightmare.

I am pleased with their response.\n\n*** Original Review ***\nUnfortunately, we did not have an overall positive experience with This side up.  The good parts were that they were all very polite, and their main mover Garret was a hard worker and smart mover.  The issues were;\n1.) Their move quote was for 7/30 which is when we wanted to move.  When we agreed to book it (less than 24-hours later), suddenly their first availability wasn't until 8/6...frustrating, but we could be flexible\n2.) With This side up, the customer pays for all travel time to our home, and from the dropoff - We invested $110 in paying them to come and go to their own office.  That's part of the contract, just something that all consumers should be aware of, as it's different among all companies\n3.) The biggest issue was the errors that they made, and the money their mistakes cost us;\n- They spent 20 minutes extra trying to figure out how to put the dresser mirror back on, asking us what we did with the screws/bolts.  Since they dismantled the dresser/mirror, they had what they needed the whole time\n- They took apart a perfectly stable bed, and somehow lost those bolts as well.  As such, they cost us extra time and money and then just arranged the bed parts, not telling us that the bed would collapse when we went to bed...Bad treatment of a customer.\n\nWe expected the inevitable small matters (furniture scuffs, torn screen, etc.) as those are a part of any move.  That said, we've moved many times and this was the most disappointing crew yet; a real pro in Garret, and a couple of pure rookies who cost us money, and frustration.  I did give the company a chance to respond, but did not hear back after they got paid.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922764c03170b:0x4ae1a2bce9dc5cd9"}

They said the 3rd guy overslept and was running late.

We're in a pretty bad drought and the tub hasn't been used in 2 years so they are used to getting water there. The 2 guys came out and said they had to run back to the shop real quick and grab something  The office lady called the widow woman we are trying to help get rid of the tub so she can have her deck redone, and said it had a lot of water in it and it was infested with roaches, both of which are absolutely outright lies and they would credit back here credit card!

Clearly my husband was upset since we rearranged our schedules and paid extra to keep my daughter in daycare. So, she says our furniture will be delivered Wednesday at 12. Because we had issues with times, I decided to call to make sure it was set for 12, and the same rep, very rudely, began arguing with me about what she said the day before and the times. I was trying to get an estimated time, and she kept interrupting me, and she finally hung up. At this time, I was livid with the situation and called back. Here\u2019s where the actual good part comes in. Said rep hands the phone to the company owner, who was extremely helpful. He listened without interrupting and sympathized with the situation. He informed me that delivery times are always approximately due to problems or delays with other scheduled deliveries and we would see our furniture between 12-4 on Wednesday. It was delivered before 12 the next day in great condition.\n\nThe reason why I am giving this company a 2 star instead of higher is solely bc of the rude and unprofessional receptionist.  She independently will run the company into the ground if she continues to act with other clients the way she did with us. I believe this company is a \u201cmom and pop\u201d family business, so I doubt she\u2019ll be going anywhere. For future clients, be ready to deal with inconsistentency and an argumentative receptionist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cbc07954d287:0xf58afce87b5d49b7"}

They never gave me time to arrive home. It was not a 30 MINUTE courtesy call as the lady at the front desk promised as well as\nWayfair.\n\nWhen I text the delivery personel halfway home, he said it's a front porch delivery, it's already there. Now, while I realize we only paid for front porch delivery, the last time they dropped off the loveseat, they sat it inside the front door, we did not ask them to unpack, nor did we pay for that. BUT, he was very unempathetic, and did NOT care at all.  The delivery personel's attitude was very, very poor.  It was blocking the doorway LITERALLY and we could not get in the front door.

We waited all morning long and as of 3:45 PM, still no piano.After several phone calls trying to track them down we discovered that the the piano wasn't picked up until 10 A.M.. They told the person in Hanceville that they didn't get back from a delivery in Tenn. until 3:00 A.M. this morning and that is why they were late getting there. If they plan on storing the piano in their truck this hot and humid weekend the heat can potentially cause the sounding board to crack and the piano would be ruined. Moving a piano is not a job for amateurs and judging by their failure to deliver as promised in a timely manner it appears that this company is not being run by professionals. I guess being on time and taking care of expensive merchandise is not a priority of this company. I called their office and got an answering machine and no cell phone to find out  the status of said deliver. I punched in their address found on the internet plugged it into the GPS and went looking for them to no avail. Needless to say our experience with this company is very frustrating and disappointing. It is now 4:00 P.M and I am going to Church one more time to see if their happens to be a moving truck off loading a piano.

My wife and I have moved 4 times over the past 2 years, and we can't say enough great things about these guys.  They have a down home quality and friendliness to their business that you just don't see anymore, mixed with a top level amount of professionalism that places them head and shoulders above the competition.  I can honestly say that we have had 2 other professional \"big name\" movers provide their services for our family, and none can hold a candle to Bolt Movers.\n\nWhen the \"big name\" guys (not Bolt Movers) moved us into our 2nd floor apartment, they loaded the hand-truck and up the stairs it went.  The words \"fragile\" were regarded as more of an opinion than a recommendation or request, and definitely not a requirement.  This is not to say that others were necessarily careless with our items, but more that they were there to get the job done and get out.  This is understandable, and I didn't mind that at the time per say, but don't expect this attitude with Bolt Movers.\n\nStephen, Patrick, and Max carried each box by hand down 2 stories (yes, each box, by hand) to the truck to make sure that nothing was damaged.  And as if this wasn't enough, laughed and conversed the entire time like we've known each other for years.  You can instantly tell that Stephen and Patrick love their job.  I don't believe a smile left their face the entire time, except for the occasional strain of heavy lifting.  To me, it looks like some arduous hard work, to them, it was like a day in the park (or for them, at the gym).  Every time we've moved in the past, we have been reluctant to make requests as we know the amount of effort that goes into moving.  Stephen, Patrick, and Max couldn't have been more helpful, and I mean that in the most real sense.  They would double, triple, and quadruple check that you wanted items in certain places.  They wanted to leave my wife and I with as little work as possible.  Which during a moving process is an absolute nice to have.\n\nTheir price was extremely affordable and competitive.  They were willing to work around our schedule and make sure the job was complete when we needed it.  Like most, my wife and I were hesitant about using a non brand-name group, and I can honestly say, kudos to us.  We couldn't be more happy with the service we received.  All I have to say is give these guys a shot.  I highly doubt you will be disappointed.\n\nI could keep going on and on with our experience, and I'm not normally a review writer, but we received excellent service from Bolt Movers (Stephen, Patrick, and Max) and I had to leave my thoughts for others.  While I hope to not be moving anytime soon, I definitely, wholeheartedly recommend these guys for anyone who does need moving services.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1479417325346, "text": "Mr. Maffett, I cannot thank you enough for your kind words!

I will NEVER trust positive Google reviews ever again when researching companies.  I am still so mad I am shaking as I type this.  If I could give negative stars I would.  Now that I have had a night to think clearly about my experience with them yesterday, hopefully writing this review will help someone else not have to deal with the absolute complete hell I had to go through yesterday.  I hired this company to move my family.  I am a single mom of 4 and couldn't move us on my own.  The guys showed up and the loading process was slow.  There was frequent standing around, smoke breaks, one of the guys even asked me to go out and buy them food and I ended up feeding them from my fridge to try to speed the process up.  I did have a lot of stuff to load, but reaching out to multiple companies today to inquire about timing with the type of load I had, the time frame was half what took place at my house, almost like they were milking the clock.  Then when getting to my new home, the men were following me (we left old house at the same time) and they disappeared for over half an hour.  Upon arrival at my new home all hell broke loose!  They spent more time arguing, fighting, taking smoke breaks (cigarettes and marijuana - I thought I smelled it and it was later confirmed by one of the men) and on their phones complaining about their coworkers than actually unloading the moving truck.  It was so bad that myself and my children had to help unload the moving truck because these \"men\" were too busy threatening each other and their families.  They were yelling and screaming at each other in my driveway for over an hour, using profanity and racial slurs, all in front of my children and new neighbors!!  When we left to do the second load more time was spent because one of the men wouldn't get in the Uhaul they had rented and started walking down the road.  Then at the end of the day when everything was finally completed I felt like I was robbed when I paid.  Yes, the owner did give a two hour partial discount on time, but after thinking more over the night and about what happened the discount was no where near what it should have been after what myself and my kids had to go though.  It was hell to a point where the cops were almost called.  Two hours and stopping the clock on the one man when he started walking down the road is no where near enough, especially when part of the time I had to pay for was for them fighting.  I saw on a previous review the owner told a customer to get a conscience.  Now I am saying that to them.  What was supposed to be a happy and exciting day for me turned into me crying for half the day and dealing with absolute HELL and it is all this companies fault for their unprofessionalism and absolutely horrible actions!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626d413052b743:0xcf18e5566e4ddaa3"}

Looked at all reviews for long distance movers and found that Armstrong had the best consistent reviews. Had a virtual assessment and they came up with a Binding contract for the weight of my mother belongings. They packed about 3 dish packs, 8 picture boxes,two TV's and a few other boxes.I packed about 20 boxes. One bed, one loveseat, headboard,desk, dinning room table, couch and two occasional chairs. The apartment was a 2 BR\n1400sf apartment. No washer dryer or refrigerator. The estimate was 7000 lbs which seemed high but I TRUSTED their evaluation based on the reviews. On arrival the driver stated that the weight was more like 4000 lbs. In my eyes that is a significant discrepancy. When asked for the final payment of 6900 dollars I mentioned this to the coordinator. The owner of the company called and said the estimate was Binding. I agreed that I had indeed agreed to a Binding estimate but it seemed wildly over inflated. His response was that I had signed the contract and I could have gotten other estimates. Really not the point but he seemed to be incapable of understanding my point. Therefore my 85 year old mom payed the bill. Otherwise the move was average. The Packers spent most of the time on their phones. The driver was prompt and coutrtious and took great care to wrap my belongings. Took a few days to wipe down all furniture and get the smell of smoke off furniture....not uncommon. Drivers shouldn't smoke in cabin but I don't know how that can be controlled.

They were terrible!\n\nThe morning of the move, they showed up several hours late. One of the men was exceptionally rude, refusing to speak to us even when addressed directly. He packed our garage, and, when they were preparing to leave, I opened the door to find that he'd left many items in there. Even his co-worker was displeased with his actions.\n\nOur belongings were in storage for about two weeks while we closed on our new home. The men who unloaded them were very good- friendly, thorough, and careful.\n\nUnfortunately, several items had been poorly packed and were broken upon arrival- a chair, bookshelves, fragile items. They had thrown our Christmas tree topper into a box, and then threw heavy tools on top of it. They wrote our tracking number directly *on* some of our furniture with black permanent marker!\n\nWorst of all, they LOST a small trunk that contained heirlooms and family memorabilia. We didn't have room for it in our vehicle, and I was assured it would reach our new location safely. Well, it didn't.\n\nWhen we called to report the missing and broken items, we received no compassion, no apology. No effort was made to find the missing trunk. The representative assigned to us was curt, and behaved as if we were wasting his time. He just emailed us a claim form, and told us to value the missing items for reimbursement.\n\nHow am I supposed to place a value on my children's locks of hair, the bible my great-grandfather gave me before he died, my high school yearbooks and photos, the stuffed Fox my oldest daughter slept with every night? They're literally irreplaceable!\n\nWe ended up with a check to replace the broken furniture. I would never, ever recommend this company to anyone.

Not all of our moves have been pleasant and resulted in high stress, damaged goods and higher moving costs in the end.  However, my family and I have recently had a totally different experience with Armstrong Relocation & Companies.\nIn preparation for the move, three moving companies were contacted for quotes.  Brad Murphy came to our house on two separate occasions, the first to ascertain our moving needs and the second to adjust the initial quote to ensure the accuracy of our moving estimate.  The initial quote was actually reduced to reflect the adjustment in estimated weight.  The quote provided was a \u201cnot to exceed\u201d amount, giving me and my family reassurance of no surprises at the end of our move.\nFrom the initial planning stages throughout the entire process, we received world-class service and support from all employees at Armstrong Moving, particularly Brad Murphy with coordination of our move, Justin who oversaw the pick-up and delivery, and Michelle, the outstanding receptionist who left her post at the front desk on three occasions to help us load packing materials at the loading dock.  All employees consistently went beyond all expectations to support us prior to and during our move.  All of our household items, including very fragile materials and heavy shop equipment were moved with extraordinary care and arrived to our new home without one scratch or any damage.   All deadlines and schedules were accurately met with ongoing communications from representatives throughout our moving process.  I truly hope Brad Murphy and the Armstrong Relocation & Companies are available if another move is needed in the future.  Without hesitation, I will go the Armstrong way once again.

Now that I live in Foley AL, I called Two Men in a Truck's Foley location to set up a local move.  I went in to the office and spoke with the manager  Katelyn who told me I would only need one truck and two men, based on the fact that I have a one bedroom apartment.  She also told me that a week day is a much cheaper rate.  So I agreed and scheduled a day off work and set up my move for a Wednesday.  I paid the deposit of $125.00 which I was told would come off of my balance due after the move.  Within 10 minutes of leaving the office, I received a phone call from Crystal out of Mobile, AL.  She told me that there would be no way that two men could move me with one load in under 8 hours and to save time and money I need to increase to three men.  After my hesitation but her persistence and pressure, I agreed (bumping my hourly rate up to $165.00 from $125.00 I originally agreed to).  So Wednesday my move day came.  I received a phone call from the driver who said \"we are leaving the lot and we are 2 minutes away\"  which is absolutely true the lot is approximately 3 miles from my storage unit.  They arrived, loaded me up (the truck was barely half full) and went to my new residence which is a 5 mile drive and unloaded.  They were finished in less than 5 hours.  I completed the transaction on the tablet the driver had and paid my balance due.  Within 5 minutes of paying and the movers leaving I once AGAIN received a phone call from Crystal out of Mobile, AL who tells me that the GPS in the truck miscalculated the time and distance and I owe an additional $185.00.  My total bill for a 5 hour local move ended up costing me over $1,100.  RIDICULOUS  !\nI feel very ripped off by this company and by Crystal who twice contacted me to increase the amount of money I owe. I ended up paying for more than 5 hours plus the deposit (which got bumped up to $165) suddenly became travel costs and costs for the materials to wrap my furniture.  My receipt stated that the drivers came from Mobile, AL an hour's drive away.  Another rip off from this company.\nOnce I was in my apartment I realized that two pieces of my furniture were damaged.  Not one piece of my furniture was ever wrapped - even though I was charged for quilts and pads.  The young men that moved me were not professional in their moving abilities and how to take careful care of furniture and especially boxes marked fragile.\nSo after many many many phone calls I did have a headboard replaced, but my phone calls regarding my dining room table damages have been avoided.\nThis company is a poor reflection on Two Men and a Truck corporation.  This franchise is a money trap and so unprofessional.  It's a shame that the people in my area who have been displaced by a hurricane would be taken advantage of by a local moving company.  I will never use this location or franchise again and will make sure that I tell everyone I know in southern Baldwin County who need a mover to AVOID Two Men and a Truck Mobile, AL / Foley, AL", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625068008713, "text": "We are sorry that you had a bad experience.

On Saturday, you returned our call, and on Monday we delivered your table. As a courtesy, we delivered the table to an address unrelated to your move, an hour round trip from our office.\nYour claim that one of the men said, \u201cthat\u2019s ok, we\u2019ll milk the clock and make the best of it\u201d is absurd nonsense.

They were legit jogging back and forth from truck to house. And even pointed out a couple things that we missed that needed to go.\n\nWhen they got to the next location they dove into the work. Again unloading fast (but safely) and putting each thing where they needed to go. Making sure that odd and important things were set aside or noted. On top of that the guys did a great job with my friends 4 kids and her mom that were at the house!

They said they would gladly move in the rain if we had to but could easily reschedule if needed.  They gave me the option of Friday afternoon or Saturday morning, no worries.  Sat morning came and two polite bright eyed men showed up right on time.  They were eager to get started and worked diligently to protect our things and move quickly.  They actually ran out of the truck back into the house to get another load, actually ran.  They had to move several awkward things, including a very heavy sofa over a rail to the bottom floor, did so with precision and care.  They moved artwork and TVs, all came out perfect.  They showed great respect and patience with my wife as to where she wanted things.

I called around to several moving companies prior to Movedaddy and was less than impressed with the fact that I was not guaranteed arrival within a specific timeframe, not to mention the job date was more than a month out with other companies, namely those having a cartoon logo, sons, and transfer in their names. Other companies made me (and my family) feel like a number and insecure about booking with them. Movedaddy took special care and provided a very customer-centric approach to our relocation. Not only were they punctual, they were also very polite, respectful, and communicative with respect to determining the logistics of our move. We have heavy, oversized antique heirloom furniture and had packed over 200 boxes from our previous 4-bedroom house. Tyler and Theo provided the utmost and outstanding customer service by ensuring every piece of furniture and miscellaneous item was carefully, neatly, and brilliantly packed. My wife and I were so impressed, and frankly inspired, by how fit these young guys are, as they literally ran (sprinted) back to the truck non-stop to grab another item in this hot summer weather. Tyler and Theo are absolute beasts...thanks a million guys!!! We will always recommend Movedaddy to our friends and family. The one-star reviews from the Amacher family or any others representing less than 5-star ratings are obviously hateful, unappreciative, spiteful, etc., and should be absolutely disregarded. This company takes a very thorough approach when moving you and your family, from the management in the office to the gentlemen showing up to your home to handle all of your family's personal possesions. There is no doubt in my mind that they would handle any concerns professionally, especially if they were in the wrong.

The movers took almost thirteen hours to move a two bedroom apt. into a house. I witnessed the slow pace myself.  By nightfall (9 pm), a replacement (and more efficient) crew had to come to complete the job. The owner should stick to the facts that the move was poorly executed. It happens sometimes.

I was delighted to read about the owners donation to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, but I'm confused because poor service does not equal racial disparity. Wouldn't it have been easier to simply give a refund to the customer.  The owners gesture shows how racist he really is...His 2600 dollar donation shows guilt and malice toward the customer.

Channel 6 receives more complaints about this company than any other.  Good reviews are done by employees and family members.\n\nRESOLUTION has NOT been reached with this company!  FRAUDULENT business practices!  It does NOT take 14 HOURS ($1600) to move someone from a 2 bdrm apt 12 miles away. No packing involved!\n\n1.  A refund is  DEFINITELY JUSTIFIED!  It is the ONLY resolution to the primary complaint; I was OVERCHARGED!  The company's workers intentionally \"rode\" the clock and took extended breaks and lunches that I paid for.  MoveDaddy's LACK of INTEGRITY and PROFESSIONALISM is palpable.\n2. It is unacceptable to wait for compensation for the damaged furniture.  As a good faith effort, this part of the dispute should be addressed immediately and separately.\n3. The donation to the Civil Rights Institute is NO CONSEQUENCE to this claim.  The fact that the owner, Richard McBee, offered to make a donation to an African-American entity is patronizing and dismissive.  This dispute is about POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE and POOR BUSINESS PRACTICES!  The owner's donation offer is indicative of his own internal conflict with being a racist.\nThe RESOLUTION is to refund me 8.5 hours that your were overcompensated due to your employees extended breaks and lunches.  Second part of resolution is to compensate me for damaged property. REFUND me my money!\n\n## UPDATE## Active BBB Complaint.   This complaint is about MoveDaddy's POOR DELIVERY of CUSTOMER SERVICE and POOR business practices!! Richard McBee's employees were taking extended breaks, lunches and being preoccupied on their cellphones while on the clock resulting in a 14 hour move that should have taken 5 hours or less.   I am willing to compromise and compensate you for 5 hours at $118 per hour.  I am requesting a refund of the other 8.5 hours plus the cost of a damaged chair estimated at $595 for replacement.\n\nThe owner, Richard McBee, did not provide me with a resolution!  I asked for a refund or at least a compromise for the POORLY executed services I received. Instead of providing me with a comparable resolution, the owner donated money to an institution that has NOTHING to do with this business transaction.    POOR service on this date was evident!  The movers took almost 14 hours to move a two bedroom apt. into a house 30 mins away.  There was NO packing involved...just loading and unloading.  The owner's $2600 donation shows guilt and malice towards the customer.  I understand that companies have bad days.  How those missteps are handled determines the company's value.  Donating money to a non-affiliated business is NOT a resolution to my business transaction.\n\nPlease note: It is a nice gesture to donate money; however, the BHM Civil Rights Center has NOT received any donation from you or your company per company representative.\n\n***UPDATE:  I have FILED a COMPLAINT with the BBB and BCA.\n\nDo NOT hire this company!!  They charged me $1600! The move was absolutely horrendous!!. Zack (with the locks) stayed on his phone the entire time. It took them 14 hours to move me!!!   I was charged $1600 for a move from a 2 bedroom apartment to a house 30 mins away.  Zack was completely belligerent when asked to complete the job and get off his cellphone.   I had to threaten to call the POLICE in order to remove him from my property. This took 14 hours and the job still was never completed. The company had to call in another truck to help the other 2 workers. My furniture was not put together. My house was left in shambles. The manager/owner Jared was UNPROFESSIONAL and rude!  Incorrect hookup in laundry caused my washer to leak in the laundry room. This crew was quite inexperienced and rude. Second crew was called in to complete unpacking!

But regardless, he was always polite and helpful. A bit\nOre communication on procedures and when to expect emails and confirmations and a deposit would have been helpful if dealing with a new clueless person like myself but it still was fine. Then the movers: first: they were so punctual they were too punctual by about 30 minutes! Lol. That was awesome. Secondly DEVON was amazing. As far as customer service... super friendly and nice and I needed that. I was super stressed. DEVON is a priceless employee from what I saw. 3: BOTH Devon and Alex were SUPER FAST! very very careful with my things also but so fast! This company and these guys are not trying to ride the clock and charge you any more than you neeed to pay. Bottom line, INTEGRITY. From Chris and the movers. Just integrity all around. Alex was quiet but a very very hard worker too. Do to end the review; I am a tough one when it comes to customer service and I could not be more impressed with these guys and I will never use anyone else to move me, asking as I\u2019m in Montgomery.

Through our awesome network I turned to my other REALTOR and Affiliate friends around the state and asked for help. Scott at Admiral didn't hesitate when I asked for them to donate some boxes for the victims.

My daughter had been quoted $108 per hour with a minimum of 2 hours. The guys were very personable and polite.  Upon arrival, I asked that they move a 1 couch, 2 chairs, and 1 recliner to a space in the basement.  Because I knew that this was in addition to the task of the move that they were hired for, I full well expected to pay whatever the charge for this additional work. They\u2019d arrived at my daughter\u2019s apartment at 8am and presented me with the contract at 10:08am...2 hours and 8 minutes.  Seeing that the charge was $378, I inquired if the extra had been to move the other items.  To my surprise the young man told me that there was no additional charge, as we were being charged by the hour.  I then asked if that were the case, why were we charged almost double the contracted 2 hours.  He nicely explained that they charge from the time that they leave their office until they arrive back at the office and then there is a charge for cleaning the vehicle.  It felt like I was being fleeced but I did not object, considering that they\u2019d moved the other items.  I paid and provided a $50 tip for each of them and before going on their way, the young man with the paperwork asked that I please provide them a review on GOOGLE...Well here it is...After going down to the basement, I was beyond appalled and unsettled by the haphazard an uncaring manner that they left the items that they moved for me.  Both chars thrown above the couch, the cushions were scattered about the floor and the recliner had been taken apart.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why these items were placed in this manner,  It took more work to disassemble and place them in such disarray, that it would have to place them in a neat order.  Further, when my husband arrived home, he located the handle for the recliner in the street.  In all honesty, I fault myself for not going down into the basement while they were there.  I just never could have imagined that this is how they left things, especially after being asked to write a review. Just so we\u2019re clear...I would never use or recommend this moving company.

My personal things were put in two storage containers 6 years ago by a business that cleaned up our water damaged house.  Five years ago that business we got to do the clean up went out of business and the two containers were taken out of our yard with my belongings and without notice.  I am not allowed to have access to them because I don't have the pin # to the account. Five years ago, we got no help from the local business or main company.  We tried to get everything take care of then and couldn't get in touch with the business that worked originally with us and PODS would only talk to the original business that was no longer in existence.\nSo, skip to a week ago I get a letter that informs me of the amount that is owed on the two pods since 2016 and will be put up for auction at the end of the month.  I am a third party and have tried to work with this company - I called and asked about the letter and was told it was a mistake and I shouldn't have gotten it.  Yet, six years later I am still not allowed to get my families' things that are still in the storage units.  So, I was told that nothing could be done and my things would be sold at an auction on 29th of this month.  So, if I paid the $26,692 that was owed by the other company that contracted with Pods originally, could I get my things with no PIN #?  I would just like some help and it seems like no one cares at this company.  There needs to be some way to work this out.  I would like to try and get some help with this because it was not my fault the other business did not pay - but you would think it is.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617805571454, "text": "We can understand how you're feeling and would like to research this further, Bette.

We also had bins that were color coded and separated based on fragility. Not only did Eric and Roy show up at a punctual time, they were extemely fast at loading the truck and being extremely careful with our fragile things. They were very professional and polite throughout the enitre process. Unloading the truck was even faster. Eric and Roy were very hardworking and made sure our moving process was as painless as possible. I will definitely use this company for any future moves and definitely refer every person moving to this company.\n\nOn 6/2/2020, my wife and I used Liberty Moving to help us move our two bedroom apartment to our new home. This job was very challenging as we stayed on the sixth floor of our apartment and the elevator for that building was broken down. Going up and down the stairs, multiple times. at the apartment is a very winded task, let alone having to carry heavy furniture. I was astonished to find out the crew that Liberty Moving sent out to our home got it done in such a quick manner. Gage, Connor, Oliver, and Barret were simply amazing and efficient. These gentleman made quick work of moving our entire two bedroom apartment onto the truck s despite going up and down so many stairs. They worked extremely hard and I know that all of these gentlemen were very tired once they finished. They truly exemplify going above and beyond. The same can be said about Eric and Roy.

The movers showed up a day and a half late and took 7 hours to load furniture from my apartment. The worst part was that 3 days later as I was driving to Massachusetts, I received a call that the driver of the moving truck was arrested for assault and the truck with my items was being impounded. It turns out the driver was a convicted felon, unbeknownst to me. It took me more than a week and dozens of phone calls, emails and affidavits to get my items released. Tyler did nothing to help me. I then had to hire a new moving company to drive from Massachusetts to Baltimore to retrieve my belongings because Liberty abandoned them there. When the new movers arrived in Baltimore, they opened the truck to find many pieces of my furniture were destroyed and others were badly scratched and dented. I had thousands of dollars of damage to my belongings. Since I had paid Tyler in full for a move that was a disaster and was never completed, I asked him for my money back. He has refused multiple times. Be careful if you are considering hiring this company. I was scammed and I don't want anyone to go through what I did. I have proof of these events as well - the signed ladling form from Liberty, emails from Tyler (who posed as \"James\" to me on the phone), a copy of the driver's arrest record from the police, a picture of one of the movers in a Liberty T-shirt, my bank statement showing that payment was made to Liberty Moving, and more. Tyler claims the movers I had did not work for him directly but everything proves otherwise. The bottom line, it was a Tyler who took my money and who now won't stand behind this mess.

We had already moved into the house and were living in it, but the majority of our belongings were still in storage. After the move was over and all of the employees were outside (or so we thought), I went upstairs to get my checkbook and I caught one of the employees in my closet/dressing room area.The hair stood up on the back of my neck. I immediately knew something was wrong, I asked him what he was doing there and he told me he brought up one last box, and then he headed downstairs. I immediately went to my jewelry drawer which was in a separate closet that had been locked all day. There is a lot more detail that I could go into about when and why I unlocked that part of the closet, but it\u2019s too much detail to go into here. What I want people to know is that I immediately opened my jewelry drawer and my wedding ring was gone. I yelled downstairs for Chris and my husband to come upstairs and I explained what I witnessed. Chris called the thief into the house and asked him if he took my ring and he denied it. Go figure. Chris said something like, \u201cwell he says he didn\u2019t take your ring\u201d. The next day, we also realized that my husbands wedding band had been stolen as well. Tyler and Chris (owners) refused to file an insurance claim with their insurance comoany to pay for the replacement of our wedding rings. \u201cBonded and insured\u201d.... by the way, that means nothing!  We were basically told to handle it with our own insurance company. And because my appraisal was old, we have never been made whole. They still owe us thousands of dollars. Over $10K. At first Tyler acted as if he wanted to help resolve this, but a couple of days after the fact, it was, deny, deny, deny. When Tyler and Chris were later asked in front of a judge if they did background checks  on their employees, the answer was, no. They were also asked if they fired the employee. We were in disbelief at their answer, and so was the judge who ruled in our favor that we didn't have to pay them for the move. The thief failed to show up for his interview with the police detective. The DA has had a warrant out for the ring thief\u2019s arrest for several months now. He was finally arrested and is out on bond. All I want is my ring back. Can you steal anything more personal? I still hold out hope that it will be found and returned to me. The employee they employed is a predator, and they allowed him into their clients homes. A simple google search of his name allowed me to pull up his arrest records on my home computer. The thief groomed me all day as he set me up for that theft. These guys seem like the nicest guys in the world, Please don\u2019t be fooled!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d521aeee9d7:0xc11ea01448237325"}

The issue was the floor area around one of my dining room corners was dipping downward. You can out assessed the issue and gave me a price to repair the issue.  You told me that my issue was repaired but it would take time to correct itself. Over what? 10 years? or close to it, the issue was never corrected or never corrected itself.  You are supposed to be the professional concerning foundations. All the work you did or what you had to do doesn't involve me. You did this, or that, MY ORIGINAL ISSUE WITH MY FLOORING STILL EXIST TODAY BUT WORST. Whatever you did under the house, has created another issue, meaning now there is a hump in another area of my flooring, which I pointed out to you. So, your text about it would take 7 working hrs under my house in April, 2017 to correct my original issue with my flooring, and the now hump in another area did and has not happened. I was here when your work team arrived and when then left. You told me while they were working under the house, you would be inside the house directing them and to make sure of leveling.  Well, you were not here to direct so none of that happened and nobody told me to call the office for anything. Attached, is where you try to blame the builder.  I hired you correct my original flooring issue well after the builder.  Your correction should have included ALL THE REPAIRS TO CORRECT my flooring issues whether it what the builder did or did not do RIGHT?  So, here we are 12 May 2017 with my original flooring issues still existing, sagging and humped flooring.

The work involved Foundation Support Piers under brick footings to fix cracks in brick veneer and Stable Lift Piers with 2x8 girders in the crawlspace to fix sagging floors.\n\nTony was referred to me by my real estate agent and he was absolutely fantastic. Tony came right on time when he said he would be there and his communications were prompt and professional. It was a pleasure to work with Tony during the proposal phase and the work itself. He is technically knowledgeable and dependable. I highly recommend him! He is the reason I contracted with Don Kennedy & Sons.\n\nThe foundation support piers did exactly what they were supposed to do. The stair step cracks in the brick closed right up as we had hoped. There was a little more impact to the yard and soil than I had expected, but not a major issue.\n\nThe Stable Lift Piers and 2x8 girders also did their job. They are not as elaborate of a solution as the adjustable \u201cSmart Jacks\u201d on top of poured concrete pads from AFS, but they do work and they are a little less expensive. I recommend that consumers understand what they are purchasing on major repairs like this and get someone to help if they don\u2019t. I did an internship with a home inspector, and I have structural improvements at my main residence, so I was able to spot some minor issues which Tony readily and proactively agreed to correct once I explained them on the phone. The laborers came right over, understood my concerns, and fixed them right away. Some additional materials were added at no expense/no questions. I think if Tony had been available to inspect before I did he would have corrected these on his own. My own inspection was prematurely hurried by the office manager \u2013 see below.\n\nAdministratively this business has some improvements to make. At 2:00 on Friday I was called by the administrative assistant that my work was complete and asking for immediate payment. I kindly asked for a chance to see the work first over the weekend and that I would pay on my way to work first thing Monday morning. I was told that they would have to ask the office mgr. This made sense and I agreed. Surprisingly, Jordan called me back promptly explaining that this was not acceptable per her manager and that I needed to leave my own job and arrange for payment with Jordan ASAP. I immediately left a voice mail for Tony. Thankfully he straightened it all out. I was never given an apology by the office manager.\n\nSo, I ran over first thing Saturday morning to inspect and observed the minor corrections needed to be made. The office mgr\u2019s insistence on paying right after they were done Friday seemed underhanded (and downright strange too), but Tony made it all right. The office manager needs to get better at being reasonable conducting business, treating people respectfully, and resolving business issues firsthand with customers. However, administrative assistant Jordan worked very hard to provide great, positive customer service. I remained with the laborers on Saturday to make sure everything was fixed to spec, and it was. The laborers worked hard and were very friendly.\n\nI\u2019d recommend to Don Kennedy and to their customers that a 7-10 business day payment period be part of the contract to allow the customer time to inspect repairs, Tony to inspect, and/or get a buddy to inspect after completion of the work. This will also take a lot of stress off the payment-hungry front office and the customer. I\u2019ve contracted lots of work over the years and I\u2019ve never been pressed for payment so urgently \u2013 despite a 50% down payment before starting the work.\n\nIn summary I do recommend Don Kennedy & Sons for residential structural repairs and especially if you work with Tony.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626a2e738087eb:0x38d226941a1e4b83"}

We thought our things would only be in storage 2 weeks, but in waiting on the closing of our house , it ended up being 2 months and a week, a circumstance beyond our control.  We contacted Power Movers immediately once we learned of our closing to get them to complete the move, but they were booked.  So we ended up hiring another company.  When the other company began to load their truck from the storage that Power Movers had loaded to the brim, by the way, the new movers were shocked at how much was broken.  Much was broken, but I only mentioned to Power Movers, one thing, the most significant to us, an antique desk that their men had wrapped too tight with plastic and apparently how they lifted it the top had come off.  The new movers pointed this out to us before they touched the peice so that we would know they had not done it.  Will, the owner of Power Movers wouldn\u2019t hear me out while I was trying to relate the situation to him.   He  kept cutting me off while I was talking, tried to accuse the new movers of the damage and even suggested that we had possibly gone in our own storage and caused the damage ourselves when he knew there was no way anyone could have stepped a foot in that storage because they had it packed to the door with no walking room.  Unlike other moving companies that we have dealt with in the past and we were professional movers with the big name movers ourselves, they didn\u2019t want to make good on any damages or even own up to any which is unrealistic.

While the two gentlemen that showed up were very nice and polite, there were items that were on my contract that didn't get moved (which weren't noticed until hours later). I originally had a fridge and dining room table with 8 chairs listed on my contract (in addition to other items) and added a few things to the contract (which I paid extra to be moved).  I was doing a double closing and my son stayed at the house to oversee. I let (showed) the guys know which items needed to be moved. My son was packing up the remainder of the house. When the guys were ready to leave, they did a quick \"walk-through\" with my son (who didn't know what was on the contract and had other things going on). Upon my return and when we realized they forgot the fridge and 3 chairs, I called the office to let them know so they could return to get the items (my son and I were on a deadline to get out of the house since the house was no longer mine). My son & I got into our respective vehicles (me to drive the 26' U-Haul truck) and headed to Florida. We dropped off the U-Haul and turned around to head back to the old house to get my truck from my neighbor's house (at no time did I hear my phone ring). Upon our return to Florida at 9:30 pm, I checked my phone and received the voicemail from the office stating that they were trying to contact me.  I tried calling back but received no answer. I called them the next morning and figured that since I couldn't get into the old house, I would chalk up the loss of the fridge and just go buy a new one. I received a call from Darius and told him that at this point, I just wanted the bill adjusted to remove the price of the fridge since it was never moved. I was told NO and he started going into well, that's what happens when you add stuff to your contract (which I reminded him that I had PAID for those additional items). Again I stated that I just wanted the bill to be adjusted for the item that they didn't move and that that would be the end of it. I was told that in no uncertain terms were they going to adjust the bill.\nAGAIN, VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND WOULD NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603825544055, "text": "We\u2019re terribly sorry that you feel as though we hadn\u2019t done our complete best to satisfy your move. But, the accusations that you convey are incorrect, fraudulent perhaps. In efforts to keep our integrity at a high standard, allow us to explain our side of the story for our viewers and potential customers. Everything that we mention here will be a reference to the contract that you signed. In the contract that you signed, \u201cline 7\u201d states that we require the customer to be present during the move. Furthermore, we require the customer to inspect each location prior to departure. By this condition alone you have failed to keep up with contract that you signed. You left your son(older gentleman) in charge, whom you now say didn\u2019t know what was on the contract. We as a company have seen this many times before. You left the responsibility of your move into the respected hands of your son whom you trust and we trusted that by your decision to do so, that we would move accordingly. By this shift in responsibility, your son had full authority on what stayed and what go. Also, in \u201cline 7\u201d the customer is responsible for doing a walk through to VERIFY ALL ITEMS are collected and the LOAD PERFORMED MEETS THE APPROVAL OF THE CUSTOMER. In continuance of \u201cline 7\u201d, if the customer fails to do this, any items left behind is the responsibility of the customer. After this Condition of the contract, is where a customer is to initial and your son had done so. Understanding that Mr.Hanlon has full authority since your absence, we decided to not only perform ONE, but TWO walk throughs with Mr.Hanlon. Furthermore, he agreed that everything was loaded up for departure to his new home. And also to mention he paid for ours services. Let\u2019s fast forward. We\u2019re just about done with the unload, assembling and staging furniture with no customer in sight. We received a call about the refrigerator being left behind after the walk through was performed. Our policy states \u201cthe customer takes full responsibility of any item(s) left behind after performing a walk through of their home\u201d. Again, we\u2019ve seen this many times before and as the company that we are, we try our best to help even in the events of mishaps. Multiple calls were made to you to pick up the refrigerator after our office received notification that it needed to go. 7 phone calls and a voicemail later to be exact. No answer, No text, No word, or No call from either customer.Forwarding to the next morning. We are a company from a different State and we can not hold our trucks due to our time schedules. We finally received a phone call from you the following morning after we had departed from FL, And after a 12(+) Hr Delay in hopes to attend to your Mistake. You stated that you hadn\u2019t received any phone calls in which we have the phone logs to prove that\u2019s inaccurate.  (The same logs we sent to you personally) Your request for an adjustment towards the bill was denied because of your abominable attitude and perfidious approach. We implore that you motion this situation to the law or the BBB because we have the signed contracts, phone logs and three witnesses to prove the inaccuracy of your statement. We are a company of integrity and we uphold our standard to the best of our ability and we will contest every erroneous statement made against us as well as 1 star ratings.

If you have the option, DO NOT use Budget Truck Rental, and IF you are using Budget, DO NOT rent through this location. At least try and find an actual Budget Rental Agency (rather than an independent contractor like this one) -- when I returned this nightmare to the local Budget Agency, the employees were very clear that often independent contractors rent out trucks without regard to their status simply for the money. Our experience was a NIGHTMARE. The truck was FILTHY and DAMAGED when we picked up - including the driver's side door of the cab hanging precariously with the fender flapping about. The agency simply encouraged documentation of existing damage so we would not be charged for it but were told there were no issues and to take the truck, and because we were under time constraints, we took the rental. The experience was miserable - the truck was dirty, LOUD, and dangerous. It was difficult to ensure the driver's side door was safely closed. In addition, when we hit rain during the drive, the ENTIRE CAB STARTED TO LEAK! Thankfully it didn't rain until the last 1.5 hours of the drive, since that time was spent soaking wet and freezing.  When I reached out to Customer Service, they offered a paltry 20% compensation of the base rental fee only ($44.64 offered, $223.20 rental fee) - between the rental, insurance, taxes and fees, and gasoline, we spent over $500 on this HORRID experience.

He ignored 5 phone calls, a voice message, and a text. Only just after I left (I'm fairly sure he watched me drive away), did he call back and claimed that he had nothing to do with the charge. Maybe a plausible excuse, except there is no way for the company to think we did not show up without his contacting them.

By the way, one of the other big truck rental companies only was going to provide a two day rental with limited mileage that would just barely cover the full trip.  So, any route deviation would have resulted in additional expense. And the other rental truck company wanted me to pick up their truck at a location 70 miles from my home!! My only issue for my Budget rental involved a seriously soiled furniture pad which couldn't be used. The other 11 were fine.

Our last move in October, 2017, Mike, Jeremy, and David were very careful with our furniture, and they spoke to us very politely, and they never lost their composure and positive attitude during our 8 hour move.  I will continue to recommend College Hunks to everyone, along with continuing to use them for all of our moving needs.  They never disappoint.

Having two children and nowhere to go, I did mind. (To be fair, their reaction and patience to what I had to say about this was far better than mine.)\n\n2.

They won\u2019t respect your hardwoods or your doors.\n\n3. When they dropped the furniture off, they did it with only 2 people. We have heavy hardwood furniture and this created a VERY dangerous situation for their workers, me (who had to help), and my furniture. And in fact, a heavy dresser tipped off the ramp and almost crushed one of their workers.

They were always there for us, called us many times to make sure everything was OK not to pressure us mind you and we\u2019re so polite and very caring of our household goods. Their district leader even showed up to see what he could do when he realized all of our household goods were put on the truck carelessly and many things broken. All this was due to the company Penske hired to move all our household goods once the breakdown occurred.  My husband and I will never hire any other company if we need anything done we\u2019re moving is concerned. I highly recommend them to anyone at all because we worked with them in Florida and worked with a different group of them in Alabama when we moved and in both states the company and its people were the same.

After the blowout the moving truck was towed to the companies warehouse where there the warehouse workers unloaded all my items a lot of expensive nice furniture pieces and antique China that was mishandled and not with any care. When the second truck arrived at my home a day late it was terrible. Most of my items were broken or missing and very soiled due to not using blankets on the floor of the nasty truck. I can\u2019t tell you what all I have that is broken and the worst part of it all is the two companies will not do anything about it. The workers were very careless and complained the entire time about how tired they were. My husband carried more boxes than all 3 of the movers together. The list goes on and on.

Their employees are inexperienced, clumsy, and unable to handle simple problems. If you have an issue, you will be directed to some call center down in Tampa, FL, who are absolutely incompetent as well. The Call Center can, and will only, call the local franchise owner to express your complaint. This franchise owner, never reaches out to his customers, despite the fact that my wife and I both got his cell phone number and left numerous messages.\n\nNow on to what actually happened.\n\nMy wife's parents recently moved and we needed to move her piano out of their house, so we hired College Hunks to move the piano. We expressly told them that it was to move a piano and that was the only thing that needed to be moved.\n\nThe scheduled day approaches. They said they would be there at 4:30. When 5:30 eventually rolled around, so did they. ((Strike One))\n\nThey then moved the piano out of the house and down the first step for a total of about 15 feet. Then for some inexplicable reason, could not move it any further. Not only that, but it was ONLY THEN that they realized that they had no way of getting the piano up on their truck. So they came to a job knowing that they were going to move a piano without the proper equipment and without enough people.\n\nThen comes the worst part of all. Instead of moving the Piano back inside where they originally moved it from. THEY LEFT IT OUTSIDE!\n\nThey Left the damn piano and said that they would be back tomorrow!\n\nWait, it gets better.....\n\nThe next day rolls around and again they say they will be there between 3:30 and 4:30. Well, 5:30 comes and goes and still no word from these stooges. That is when my wife and I started calling that call center and reaching out to the Franchise Owner and even the guy driving the truck.\n\nThey said they were running late and would be there at 6:30. We then asked them if they had a different truck or additional equipment. They told us what they were bringing and IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAD THE DAY BEFORE.\n\n7:00 PM comes along and still no word. We call that Call Center again, and this time they tell us that they had to reschedule and that they would be there the following day, which would have left this piano OUTSIDE for TWO Days!\n\nI finally had enough of these inept morons and called up someone who also owned a moving service. He was able to get out to the house the following morning and move the thing in less than an hour.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nThis company absolutely sucks. Incompetent Employees + Incompetent Ownership and Service. They left my wife's piano OUTSIDE for TWO Days before we finally had enough of their nonsense and hired another company.\n\nI will never use College Hunks again, nor will anyone that I know.\n\nAfter I am done with this review, I will actually be looking into filing a claim against these morons for the scratches that they also put on the piano during their re-enactment of a Monty Python Sketch.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjMMa7LkPZKbI4_q-0AA5lPjSfFBVVIL6CoI2f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8oJEZPtCRlBvWJ52jF5l2hUQNTZ3NRB06feEh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCW8NgNglF_OtX0HNlGIbtt_Ssdg7udlz9XPMz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec334a7d1c7:0xd295fc628abd4f5c"}

Very strange that almost all of their five-star reviews are from people who only have one review written.  Usually if someone is going to take the time to write a review and it\u2019s the only one they\u2019ve ever done it\u2019s because of a poor job, not an awesome job***\n\nIt is funny that this company has a motto of \u201c how can we make your day stressfree?\u201d  All they do is cause more stress.  The actual movers are inexperienced and I had to coach them through the process of getting the couch through a doorway.  The first day of the move they kept me waiting six hours before they got there and the second day they were four hours late.  Management is of no help, neither are the owners.  The guys who did the move were friendly, but sometimes that is not enough.  I hired this company to pack the apartment and move it downstairs in the same building, I ended up having to pack and move almost everything by myself.  The only thing the movers ended up moving where the pieces that were too large for me to do by myself.  In fact, I had to hire a random Uber driver to help move things so I can get out an hour early to make my flight which the owner and manager is new prior to the move, but did not care.  They talk a good game, but cannot walk the walk.  Be wary of all these excellent reviews, if you look on Yelp you will see true reviews.  I would recommend any other company in the world over this one.  The only thing the movers brought was one dolly and one screwdriver.

They complained about the hill we lived on, the stairs they had to use, and that they had been working over 14 hours at that point. There were huge periods of time that neither mover was actually moving anything. It took 8 hours to load the truck, even though during the walk through we were quoted 7 for the entire move. It took them 3 hours to make a 2 hour drive. The unloading only took 3 hours. The guys that unloaded the truck actually did their job. They were very surprised it took the other movers so long to load the truck. The co owner of the company Sean refused to talk to us. Conner, the other co owner tried to convince us that they lost money moving us. We were quoted $752, it ended up costing $1380. It was awful on my two children, we didn't even get to leave our old house until 12:15, and the movers didn't finish unpacking until 6.

I relocated from Alabama to Georgia and used this company to move some of my belongings into a pod. Well, the movers that arrived were not prepared to move much of the items they were to move. Because I was in Georgia, my realtor agreed to oversee the move. She called me stating that the guys were cramming things in the pod haphazardly and was certain that many of the items would be damaged as they didn't bring any supplies to wrap or disassemble the items(e.g. Exercise mirror, bowflex treadmill). They were willing to scratch up the paint on my walls bringing the fully assembled gym equipment out of the room because they were not equipped with tools.\n\nThey finally agreed to go to the office building to get tools to bring back. So, what was to be a three hour move turned into an EIGHT HOUR move.\n\nLastly, my realtor told the head crew member to leave the key in the opened lockbox when they were done with the move. She wasn't able to stay on site for eight hours. The guys agreed to do so. She texted them about 30 minutes after they'd left the house, askin if they'd left the key in the lock box as instructed. The mover stated that he did NOT plave the key in the box but that he'd left the key under the mat on the front porch(below the OPENED lockbox). When she asked why he didn't leave the key in the lockbox, the mover responded, there's nothing we can do about it now, we've left.\n\nThe next morning the appraiser came to the home and the key was NOT under the mat. So, I had to reschedule my home inspection and pay a locksmith to change my locks. Especially since I still had a zero turn mower(10k), golf cart and other valuables still in my home that my husband was coming back to remove a couple days after they moved the items.\n\nI really feel their plan was to come back with the key and remove some of my belongings from the home. Why else would they agree to place the key in a lock box that was already \"opened\" and located above the mat they claimed they placed the key under. Makes no sense.\n\nSo, I decided to write a review. Only after trying to reach out to the owner several times about the issue of the key and never receiving a response. I did speak with the Operations manager and he was very nonchalant and rude. My realtor and I were both on the line and he wouldn't allow either of us to speak on the issues. He was very defensive and talked over us the entire time.\n\nI ended the call thinking, the most I can hope for is that my equipment in the pod isn't damaged when it arrives to Georgia and to just be grateful I changed my locks before whomever made it back with the key they \"wilfully failed\" to place in the opened lock box just above the mat they claimed they placed the key under.\n\nI truly encourage anyone searching for a moving company to please find another one. Moving is stressful enough. The last thing you need is to work with a company who's unprofessional and lack common decency and respect in servicing their clients. I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923a491073409:0x2725981c1fcf7a1e"}

The guys called before they showed up.  The worked hard, even through a lovely little storm that came through.  Then soaking wet they unloaded at our new home.  The final price was better than I expected by far! They offered to go out and replace a book case that got damaged in the move (the fact that they were honest enough to let us know it happened was amazing). And it was a very cheap book case handled by young boys.  No surprise that it had an issue.  They were so polite and helpful.

We used them about 4 years ago and they were great. Then we used them a couple weeks ago for our move and it was the worst experience we have ever had with a moving company. We started at 9:00am and they did not leave our home till 11:30pm. A lot of our furniture was scratched and our walls were hit. My husbands gun came up missing and we found the gun case thrown behind our deep freezer. They busted our 60inch tv. We told them we would pay half that night and we would settle up with the owner the next day because of our experience. My husband said make sure you have him call me. The next day we heard nothing. My husband called 4 times and emailed 2. The owner did not call him for 3 days. Then he said he would look into it. He got one of his employees to call my husband back and tell him they were going to send a company out to repair our furniture. The furniture company called and my husband ask how exactly they go about repairing the furniture and they said with a furniture pen \ud83e\udd14. Umm no thanks. My husband tried to call him back multiple times. The owner never handled business and we have heard nothing from him! This all happened on April 30th. When my husband told the employee that we had such a good experience before with this company and he is not sure what happened, the employee stated, \u201c well you paid top notch for those movers.\u201d My husband said well that\u2019s funny because this move was more expensive \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\nVERY unprofessional not to mention they have a thief working for them.

On the phone and through our various email exchanges they sounded as if they were genuinely interested in our business!  Not only did Mr. Devri Hensley II ensure us that a crew would be there, he promised to maintain an open flow of communication with us, so we\u2019d know what to expect.\nThe only problem with all of this was that they didn\u2019t show up on the agreed upon date and time. Then we had another problem. No response. None whatsoever. Our numerous calls and voicemails have gone unanswered, ever since.\nNow, since they have still failed to call us back or provide explanation, I\u2019ll ask the questions here with hopes of getting some sort of response below:\nFirst, why have you done this to us? It was pretty awful having to call friends and family, last minute, to help us move, quickly. (They appreciate you too, by the way.) We would have simply tried another moving company if you had only said something along the lines of, \u201cNo sir, we can\u2019t move you that day, we\u2019re booked full.\u201d Or if there were another reason that made sense, maybe we could have understood. After all, we consider ourselves pretty understanding. But not now.\nWhy won\u2019t you return our phone calls and emails? We understand stuff happens, but you\u2019re running a business. Now you\u2019ve just made yourself look completely and utterly incompetent. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for, because it seems to be, then congratulations!\nAnd lastly, I have to ask, why did you decide to open this business? Sometimes it\u2019s okay to admit when you\u2019re wrong. Maybe you should reconsider this.\nBut in all seriousness, unless you like being suddenly caught in overly-anxious situations, I\u2019d suggest everyone steer clear of Easy Moves.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923a491073409:0x2725981c1fcf7a1e"}

The owner was a great communicator, always responding quickly to any inquiries, and they responded in a very timely manner, always arriving when they were expected to drop off and pick up the shell.  The owner was also very instructive and helpful in explaining how the shell worked and certain do's and don'ts, like being to put a pad or towel down on the ramp in the event of rain (for safety).  I thought the price was very fair.  Also, I didn't worry at all about the security of my valuables as we were able to put our own lock on the shell before they picked it up for storage.  I will definitely use Zippy Shell again if I ever have to move again (which I hope I don't!), and I will also recommend it to any friend.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889196b92e29cc5:0x3de9f296d1d9a4c"}

My story goes like this.  Ordered 2 PODS and realized the day of loading that I was going to need another one.  I called PODS and requested a new container and the call lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes.  I also scheduled the pickup for all the PODS after loaded and was assured all three would be stored in Montgomery, AL, which would be the closest storage facility that would deliver to my new address in Auburn, AL.  The technician told me to just call about three days before I needed them delivered to the new address and there wouldn\u2019t be any issue.  There was a big issue.  They didn\u2019t store my PODS in Montgomery, they stored them in Birmingham and claimed they needed five days for transit and three day for logistics.  I spoke to three or four supervisors and nobody could do anything to get my PODS on the day I requested.  They did say that if my PODS would have been stored in Montgomery like they said there would not have been any issue.  THEIR FAULT! So they put in an account review and some guy called and stated they lost the 2:15 min call I had with them.  He credited my account $100 dollars and said basically take it or leave it and he didn\u2019t have to give me anything.  So I accepted I was getting my PODS on the earliest date they said.  I moved my entire family down the day prior because all three PODS were scheduled to be delivered.  They only delivered two of the three and stated the other one was never scheduled.  I asked if someone could just please contact the Birmingham facility and see if they can make an exception and deliver it the next day but was met with the standard \u201cthat is not our policy or procedure\u201d.  I had to drive my family back to my parent\u2019s house to stay with them for another week because the one POD they didn\u2019t send is the one with all of our furniture.  It is taking them nine additional days to deliver my last POD and I\u2019m having to take more vacation time off to unload it.  They also charged me for and extra month of storage because due to their mistake the PODS were in storage for more than 30 days and they don\u2019t prorate monthly storage fees.  I will never use this company again.  They have ONE job, to deliver/store PODS and they can\u2019t even do that right.  WHEN they make a mistake, and they will, they will not fix it.  They will tell you to submit and account review and someone will get back to you in 3-5 days.  Not one time did I call them and spend less than an hour on the phone.  If you ask for a supervisor, they put you on hold for half hour and then come back on stating they are busy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f1fb1cb8e33:0x27a0a5ff6fe82e95"}

I was told I would have four guys to move a three bedroom apartment fourteen miles down the road.  My package included all blankets and wrapping material to protect my furniture.\nNeedless to say this move was anything but pleasant. The moving crew showed up 45 minutes late.  The moving crew supervisor quite before the furniture was completely loaded.   I repeatedly call Brad (owner & manager) with every negligent action that occurred with the remaining moving crew.  I had damage to my new hardwood floor, busted freshly painted door frames, knocked a hole in my ceiling, broken dresser handles, strap indentions on bedroom dresser and slid my leather couch across the cement front porch shredding the side corners. Beds were made to look like they were put together but not one single crew was installed.  I found this out when I went to but sheets on the beds and they fell apart.  I was also told all furniture was off the truck when I discovered my bedroom nightstand was missing.  I found this and a busted chest of drawers with clothes spread out under blankets so I would not find them. Brads response was for me not to worry about it that he\u2019d take care of me.\nAll boxes, TV\u2019s, and hanging clothes were moved independently.  They were strictly moving furniture.\nI did everything I was instructed to do to file my claim and have yet to hear back from the insurance company.  My confirmation email stated it would take 30 days to process.  It has now been 60 days and I haven\u2019t heard a word.\nI will say Brad was very pleasant every time I called and listened to all my complaints but the downfall in any business is lack of action in customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ede3ecc47dd:0x6e0df98ae12a8cda"}

My wife and I contacted the office and informed of the damage in which they made it seem like they would take care of it. Well it\u2019s now 3 weeks later and they have just advised we need to provide them an estimate. Why was this not stated weeks ago. They have attempted to give us $180 to repair a desk, bed, and dresser, and wall. That is ridiculous.

I have never written a negative Yelp/Google review, BUT I have also never been treated so poorly (thank you Nate) as a paying customer of a business. We booked with All My Sons for our Saturday move a few weeks in advance. My husband spoke to MULTIPLE different reps, male and females, confirming that movers would be at our house at 8:00am. On the day of our move, we got a call saying, \u201cthe crew never showed up\u201d and they were going to be late. 9:00am rolls around, and we get another call saying they won\u2019t be there until 9:45am. Frustrated that we have now lost 2 hours of moving time (moves are already high-stress to begin with without the added frustration of movers not showing), I call the office to express my concerns. Enter the ever-so-lovely \u201cNate\u201d, who I HOPE does not have a \u201cManager\u201d title to his name. If so, you should seriously reconsider. Argumentative, rude, arrogant\u2026the list goes on. Nate probably needs a refresher in Customer Service 101, \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d. Nate tells me that their moves start from \u201c8-10am\u201d, so \u201ctechnically\u201d they weren\u2019t late and \u201cno one would have told us they were going to be there by 8am\u201d. I explained that we spoke with MULTIPLE people and that was not the case\u2026.we were assured they would be there at 8am. After a few LOVELY back and forths with this Nate character, he says, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m cancelling your move and you can find someone else.\u201d\n*Click*\nHe hangs up the phone. If you are the owner of All My Sons, please know that you have someone representing your business in the POOREST way. I have already submitted a complaint to the BBB. This business needs to be INVESTIGATED and management needs to be reevaluated. My experience is NO WAY to treat a paying customer. Cancelling someone\u2019s day-of service because they receive a VALID complaint is beyond me and I hope there are repercussions for Nate treating people the way he does. Based on Google/Yelp reviews, this is not an isolated incident.  Luckily, the bright spot in the day was calling MOVEDADDY who completely rearranged their moving schedule to accommodate us and did so with the most POSITIVE attitude. And they were $50+ less expensive/hour. SO all-in-all crisis averted in doing business with All My Sons, and I\u2019m glad they did not get a PENNY of my money.

This time, this was a local move.  It was an easy move for the movers as well.  I had already taken most of our things, but I hired All My Sons to move a few dressers, an fridge, washer, dryer, and a couple of game tables.  We also had a large piece of furniture in storage.  But, they didn't have to move beds, clothes, dishes, etc.  The move should have taken about 2-3 hours.\n\nMy move was scheduled to start at 8am.  At 7:45am, I received a call that due to DOT requirements, the driver could not arrive until 10-10:30am.  I get it.  I work with DOT every day.  But this was poor scheduling and the last-minute notice wasn't pleasing, but I was willing to let it slide.  But the driver did not arrive until 11:45am.  I had an important appointment at 2pm that day.  I told the driver we needed to get moving.  He replied saying his boss called him at 10am wanting to know if he could work.  Now, I finally know the truth.\n\nAt first, the guys were moving well.  They loaded up the house in about 35 minutes.  I was pleased.  Then we dropped by our storage unit and the driver was more interested in looking at our pictures or checking out our motorized toys.  At this point, I knew he was dragging his feet and running up the clock.  They finished the move in about 4.5-5 hours.  We were moving to a new home that we built.  They scratched the staircase in two places pretty severely.\n\nI spoke to the supervisor and told him about my complaints.  He asked me what I was looking for.  I told him I would leave the resolution up to him, but I knew if I ran my business with this type of communication and lack of urgency, I would lose my customers.  He responded, \"Well, you were moved today and the guys have to get paid.\"  So, I paid, but I promised myself I would leave reviews everywhere I could.  I was completely disappointed.\n\nThe response below seems to be the same cut and paste response issued by All My Sons to every negative review.  I gave All My Sons the opportunity to make the transaction right over the phone.  I told them I would leave the remedy up to them and the response I got was, \"You got moved today and the guys have to be paid.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536595536947, "text": "Hi Ryan, thank you for leaving your feedback.

One of the crewmen even made the comment we are way overworked and underpaid and management is horrible. Needless to say we have a lot of damage, the movers hate management and their jobs, and we had to pay for a horrible move. I spoke with friends afterward who encountered a lot of these same issues.

Very unprofessional, unethical and plain rude!!!!!  I WISH I HAD READ PREVIOUS REVIEWS BEFORE I SCHEDULED A MOVE!  AAANND I WISH I COULD RATE THEM A ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI called several weeks in advance to schedule a moving date. The customer service was awesome! I even called back several other times to verify some other information.  NEVER  IN ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WAS I GIVEN DIRECTIONS HOW TO SET UP MY HOUSE FOR MY MOVE!!!\nSaturday, April 13,  2019  the movers arrived. They walked through then had me to sign some papers. They begin to move a few things. The heavier set gentleman was on the phone. Still no moving going on! The next thing I know a lady shows up , introduces herself and said she was doing a walk through. I said okay. She walked my town house and stated to me that I need to clean my dresser off. There was some sticky residue on there. I said okay and cleaned the dresser.  I went back to sit down. I noticed they had packed my TV and I needed it because Direct TV was headed to the new location. My friend was coming to pick it up the TV.  I went to the truck to get the TV. The manger and the heavier set guy were behind the truck smoking cigarettes. So I asked,  \"Were we moving anything today.\" \"You all are on a smoke break and nothing has been moved!\" She said , no ma'am.  We are getting ready to move you. \"I suppose what I said led to what happened next\"  She sent  the African American guy into my town house to let me know they had to CANCELED my move today.  I guess because I was African American that was the reason for sending him. He had no explanation. I asked since she was the manger why didn't she come and tell me what the problem was and why my move was canceled.  He said she a White lady. In other words, he was sent to do the dirty work! By this time I am furious! I call the office and some gentleman couldn't really explain either. He just said it was cancelled. I used some unprofessional words and hung the phone up. I called back to speak to her and she stated that there was no room for their dollies to pass through, there was an odor and it was not clean. All of those were lies! I don't know any place that will be clean when you are moving.  I had all of my boxes and bags in one  location. They were labeled and separated.  The only items upstairs were the bedrooms. I used some more unprofessional , choice words again! My issue with the entire thing is NO ONE explained to me how to set up for the move or came our prior for a walk through. SHE told me that was COMMON SENSE! I gave some more unprofessional , choice words.  I live in a town house which does not have a lot of room. I can not help how many items I had. I did contact corporate office and explained EVERYTHING! I even expressed that I used unprofessional words and I did apologize to the corporate office.  Thank God I have awesome family and friends!!! They moved me with no hesitation and never complained. What about the people who don't have family and friends in the city!  Treat people how you want to be treated!  KARMA is for real!!!!

I have use movers several times before, and never before have I received the level of service that I experienced throughout the entire process of this move. Scheduling my moving day and receiving my quote took no time at all, and I was shocked at the affordability off the bat! The pricing is super straight forward, and the  is charged by a flat by the hour fee, with no hidden costs - it made it easy to help budget. I then received a follow up call from the local team that would be handling my move, personally introducing themselves and making sure I didn't have any additional questions.  However, the move day itself is actually what floored me... this was no easy move, I was downsizing my parents from a 4 bedroom house with a basement full of stuff to a two bedroom apartment - so the move involved a LOT of stuff and several stops (between storage and the new place).  Quinton (the driver) and his team (Quinteze, Jamaul and Colin) showed up right on time, moved quickly and efficiently, and never once acted like anything was a problem! They really went above and beyond, even taking items that we planned to give away down to the basement for us. These four guys were so nice and helpful, and really made what was a tough and challenging move for me, seem easy!  I cannot recommend this team and the company high enough - I will use them for ANY move I plan in the future.

Which chose to hire movers because we just completed renovations and wanted to avoid causing damage to our newly renovated house. They told my wife they had an early morning opening and a late morning opening. We chose the later option because of our work schedules. They showed up an hour earlier than we expected and we were not prepared. The staff was nice  and they did not waste anytime getting loaded. When I arrived to the house my wife was disappointed. When we called AMS to arrange the move we asked them if they could assemble some items. My wife was told they disassembled and assembled. When my wife showed the men the items she was told her they would only assemble what they had previously disassembled at the pickup. It might have been a misunderstanding on our end, but I'm not sure why it would be a problem since they charge by the hour. The most disappointing part was the damages caused to our house. We know these men are working hard and furniture can be difficult to move through hallways and doors so we expected minor scratches/dents might  occur, but in two places the damage was beyond what I would call minor. The casing on the front door and one of the hallways has chunks of wood taken out of them.  While we still would have been annoyed.. If we had we been notified during the move we would have let it go. Nobody said anything about the damages and now we will have to make repairs to work that was just completed. Nice people to work with, but they need to work with their staff on communication to their clients and honesty.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1465391540721, "text": "Brian, Thank you for your valuable feedback, we are sorry we did not meet your expectation on your relocation with us.

I was told I would receive a call 24-48 hrs before the move to comfirm time. I did not. I contacted them less than 24 hrs before our scheduled move only to be told they over booked and if it was ok, would I be willing to moved the day back one day. So I agreed since they offered to lower the rate and make me the firts appointment of that day. So Monday came. I was told they would be there between 8:30a and 9:30a. I'm almost 3 months pregnant & I feel asleep about 9am. I woke up around 11am. No movers!!! My husband said they called at 10:48a saying they were behind and several workers called out. 8 to be excat. This is one of the reasons I originally scheduled my move for that Sunday--the day before the Holiday (Memorial Day). My husband was told they would be there in a few hours. A few hours passed, still no movers. We called them back around 1pm. Was told they were still coming it would be another few hours. At this point we are upset but we wait, and wait and wait. I took another nap this time with my 17 month old who wasn't to thrilled about being in the house all day with boxes everywhere. We wake up around three. Still no movers. My husband calls. It was a little before 4pm. He was told \"the guys are finishing up a job now and they are headed your way\". My husband asked what time can we expect them? He was told \"between 5p and 6p\". At this point we wait and wait and wait. 5:55p, NO MOVERS, NO CALL! My husband calls back, NO ANSWER!!!! Calls again and again and again. NO ANSWER. Around 6:10p the rain starts and it doesnt stop. It's heavy rain. 6:20p driver calls. Here is our conversation:\nDriver: We are headed your way\nMe: Sir it's raining, like really raining. Isn't our stuff going to get wet??\nDriver: Yes Mam it is. Even if we use the pads they will get wet and then sit on your stuff.\nMe: I feel like I have no choice\nDriver: What do you want to do? Do you want us to head that way?\nMe: I don't know\nDriver: Mam we haven't eaten all day and we would like to see our families before 11pm.\nMe: Well why don't you all stop and get something to eat and maybe the rain will stop by then.\nDriver: Mam we don't get paid to eat\nMe: (Mouth drops), I'll just cancel.\nDriver: Ok call Chris\nMe: Who is Chris? Do you ha.....\nDriver: Click up (He hangs up on me)\n\nThis all happened before anyone physically came to move our stuff.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ede3ecc47dd:0x6e0df98ae12a8cda"}

I've used 2 different moving companies in the last year, All My Sons and 2 Men & A Truck. In short, I'll likely be using 2 Men going forward because it was just a better experience overall and worth the difference in rate per mover.\n\nPositives: The All My Sons (AMS) hourly rate, per mover, is far less than the competition in the field. Their sales staff is persistent in booking orders (which I like - some don't). They call a lot to check in and see what they can do to help. The movers didn't really sit around; they moved with purpose most of the time. The movers were very nice and did everything they could to provide good service.\n\nNegatives: We were scheduled for 8-8:30am arrival; they didn't show up until 10:30am. Furthermore, I had to be the one to call to find out why they were late (had to call 3 times). The operations gentleman/rep that I talked to about their delayed arrival was straight forward but more in the sense of being border line rude. Just my opinion at that time; and I'll admit I was heated & mad having to call 3 times so the rep could have been nice the whole time but I wasn't truly listening...the underlying issue had something to do with the moving truck needing gas and their gas card limit was too small for what the moving truck needed; getting approval for the gas was what created the delay. Ultimately, the ops office set up the movers for failure.\n\nMoot Points: I don't know that the movers were properly prepared for my move. I don't know if I did a poor job of describing what's going to be moved, or if AMS didn't communicate to the moving team.\n\nBottom Line: I needed a moving company to move items. AMS did that. I wasn't blown away by their service.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1477920573821, "text": "Matt, Thank you for your valuable feedback, we are sorry we did not meet your expectation on your relocation with us.

I had to call and text them several times before finally reaching them and agreeing to a scheduled time with ended up being the day before I was moving. It originally was suppose to be between $250-300, but we ended up having to pay $400 due to them claiming I had a lot of boxes. The owner I'm assuming named Kenneth or Kenny has a bad memory. I told him the times I needed to move and he acted as if I never did. Luckily I record my calls. I was moving from a 2 bedroom apt, so it wasn't like I had much. They complained abt moving my things from one upstairs to another. Complained abt how long it took for me to sign my new lease and get my keys to my new apt. I feel like if I'm paying your business almost $500 to just move my things from one local place to another, then you should just do it, w/o complaints! They didn't ask where I wanted my furniture to be moved to, they just dumped everything wherever. After having to hear their disrespectful language and complaints and deal with ALL of that, they stole some medications from me and my children's electronics! Like WTH?! I will definitely be reporting them to the BBB and to whoever else will listen. They are crooked, unprofessional, raggedy, lying, horrible business men!

I had to take my mother on an emergency pre-move run, and we went down the road for maybe 15 minutes. When we got back, not only was everything loaded up in the wrong order, but they had loaded our friend's things into the MIDDLE of the truck.

They said it would take an extra hour or so to take that furniture back off.\n\nFast forward to when we were unpacking, I found some precious gifts given to me just thrown in a box, shattered.

I've dealt with MANY moving companies over the years and while they aren't the worst I've dealt with (Allied...AWFUL) they weren't as professional as I'd like to see. They've moved items for me on two different occasions. The first time they moved some items from my house to a storage unit. In the process, they damaged my piano. To this day, they haven't repaired it.\n\nDue to a lack of variety/choices when it comes to movers in this area, I decided they were the best option for a more significant move about a year later. I figured I'd give them another shot. It started off on a sour note, when they showed up nearly 2 hours later than the time we agreed upon for the start of the move. During the process, some of our antique furniture was damaged because it wasn't padded the way we requested.\n\nFinally, after paying for the move with a check I was informed that they'd LOST it later that afternoon. This required me to place a stop payment on the original check and potentially compromised my sensitive account and personal information. I requested compensation for this mishap and the manager agreed to reimburse a small portion of the move and to cover the cost of the stop payment.\n\nOverall, I have dealt with MANY more professional companies. The problem is, when you live in a small town like Daphne, AL the competition is few and far between and there is less effort to provide exemplary service. Honestly, if there were other options I'd look elsewhere. Unfortunately, based on what I've researched...they are the best you are going to get short of doing it yourself with a U-Haul.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43bef7771f83:0x31d026c9a6387d6"}

I expected 2 guys but it was just him and his pickup truck. At first I was mad, but then the first piece he moved was an 17th Century French Armoire that weighed 673 lbs by himself. Needless to say, I was impressed. I was even more surprised when he picked up my king size mattress and carried down the spiral staircase without touching anything. But when he took his shirt off to pack the kitchen, I knew he was good. He must\u2019ve been doing it a long time due to his chiseled physique and bulging muscles. Anyone who got him as your mover, was extremely lucky. Will use again.\nOn a more serious note, the lady ( k8lusterio )\nThat tried to say I gave her a bad estimate. I remember you. First off, in 99.9% of cases, it\u2019s twice as fast to carry boxes than to dolly them. The dolly is for lazy people who don\u2019t want to work. Secondly, you had more stuff than would fit on one truck, which means you were not truthful about how much stuff you had to move. NEVER, would I have given a 5 hour estimate on a job that was going to be more than one truck. Especially going from Daphne to Mobile. It\u2019s like this, most people were happy with us when I was there, and most are satisfied now. However, in my 15 years of moving I have learned that when people CALL to get an estimate, a small minority will not be forthcoming with what they have, hence they get a low ball estimate so when the bill comes they will try not to pay, or remind you of the estimate. Things that impact your price on a move.\n1. Be honest with what you\u2019re really moving\n2. Get as close to an accurate count of boxes as you can. That\u2019s a big one. Some people guess 25, and they really have 125. Boxes take more time than furniture.\n3. Be honest about access. Don\u2019t tell the estimator that your driveway is nice and flat and no stairs into the house, then they get there and it\u2019s a steep drive they can\u2019t even get up with 8 stairs going into the house. Or it\u2019s a winding driveway that really needs a 14 ft truck instead of a 24ft so it can maneuver and not get off in your grass.\n4. Move as much of the little stuff as possible. The big furniture is easy and fast to move.\n5. List any difficult pieces you know your prior movers had a hard time with. Or if special tools are needed. Mostly they will show up with a Phillips, flathead, pliers, and Allen wrenches. Some guys have more, but you can generally take down a house and put it back up with those tools.\nLike I said, most people are satisfied, there is a small minority that you will never please. That\u2019s true in any field you choose, but especially moving. It\u2019s not cheap to move, and it\u2019s definitely not cheap to own a moving company. Trucks are expensive, pads, dollies, insurance. You don\u2019t want movers making $8 hr, or you will get $8 hr movers. So most of the companies pay relatively well. And chances are, whatever moving company you choose, you will end up with movers that used to work for the company you\u2019ve been complaining about. Moving company employees are a lot like servers in the food industry. You sort of get stuck in the job and bounce around from moving company to moving company depending on management and who\u2019s paying more per hr. Motivated has the longest tenured people that you\u2019ll find of any moving company. In the end, go with your gut. DO NOT go with someone just because they are cheaper. Remember, $5 extra an hour may just get you some really experienced movers that can get you done faster and save you money over the cheaper labor that may drag the job out.\nI miss my time in this industry, sort of. I loved helping people in that kind of stressful time and 95% of the time they were ecstatic because we worked hard and fast to save them money.\nGood luck to anyone moving.

Four hours from the start, his men were still at the old house where there were still the TV, treadmill, total gym and gorilla racks to load.

Roberts,\nFirst off Mrs. Roberts , I want to say I\u2019m very sorry your going thru a bad situation.Also when your ex husband hired us, we were just contracted to move some furniture. By no means , did he tell us he was stealing furniture from his ex wife and that\u2019s why I have been doing everything to help you get your items back. Several of our past customer referred him to us and then you to us so it was kind of a freak incident where both of y\u2019all contacted the same moving company.\nThis was a very volatile situation from the start. You told me you had a abusive husband and you were afraid to come down and be there for us to load your pod. So I rented a truck(a truck you promised would get everything . And when I got there I noticed half the place wasn\u2019t packed so I went and spent 75.00 in packing supplies to pack and didn\u2019t charge you for it . And the boxes that were packed were poorly packed , I couldn\u2019t even build packing walls in the truck because the boxes were crushing down and full of cleaners and chemicals that were not even supposed to move. And it\u2019s against company policy for us to open any boxes that were packed Previously by the owner . I flat rated one truck load at 600.00 and ended up having to make two full truck loads and didn\u2019t charge you for it or for the packing. Also the storage unit price was in that 600.00. Plus you had us so worried your abusive  husband was gonna show any minute and cause chaos so my guys were trying to hurry and do the best job they could. You didn\u2019t have any pads, so I even threw in a50 yard roll of stretch wrap for free to at least added some protection and wrap everything for a little protection which we all know isn\u2019t guaranteed. I also used ten of my own pads for the precious items to make sure they were safe and still didn\u2019t charge. I went above and beyond to help you with this horrible situation and it saddens me after dealing with you over the last month you would say these things on here. Also you told me your husband rummaged through your belongings before we came so I took pics of all the damaged before we started wrapping and padding the items. You knew yourself he had done some damage to your belongings before we even started. Now you want to blame it on us. That\u2019s horrible. But everything In storage is wrapped and padded with my equipment .I wish you the best.\nLee"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a422b4a45551b:0x3d644703a0c01dd"}

Everyone had bad stories to say against the other and everyone I was speaking with had horrible reviews.  I then went on Thumbtack and requested quotes for movers, that's where I found About The Move.  I received a quote right away and a follow-up call from Tammy to go through all of the items being moved to give me a very good estimate.  I really liked that the pricing was hourly based as opposed to how many boxes and truck capacity I was using.  The real deciding factor for me was that I would have the same crew loading my items, driving them to my destination, and unloading them - also, that my items would not be mixed with any other household's belongings on the truck.  Tammy worked with me through the booking process and even gave me options to move my date based on last-minute changes if we needed to.  JR and Sunshine did an impeccable job!  They were polite and professional and really went above and beyond to ensure the safety of my items as well as having to lift part of my sectional couch over the backyard fence to get it out of the house.  When arriving to our new house 405 miles away, they worked quickly and professionally ensuring that all items that were disassembled were put back together and set up just how they found them.  I really cannot say enough good things about this company.  The pricing estimate was on-point and straightforward with no extra/unexpected fees.  They collected a small deposit prior to the move to hold my spot and I was able to complete the final payment via credit card after everything had been delivered to my new house and I was satisfied.  We moved from Destin, FL to Tampa, FL and everything was complete within a 24-hour period.  This company is a class act and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for reputable movers whether local or long-distance.  I will definitely call them again when I need movers.

To explain again::  We came to load on day one, and thought we were wanted to leave due to customers being tired from long day loading three trucks and were unable to finish the load on first day. We informed customers we had moves booked for next day so needed to load everything while we were there day one. Next day had to do the best t moved that had been booked for awhile so didn\u2019t get to come until later in the evening to finish loading. Not a quote but an estimate on time, and the time took about 5 hours (4 men 3 truck\u2019s at $222 per hour) longer to complete entire move than anticipated, our apologies, in result of that the cost did increase by nearly $1000.00.  If you were happy with everything but the price I don\u2019t think one star rating is fair for or three would be understandable.
