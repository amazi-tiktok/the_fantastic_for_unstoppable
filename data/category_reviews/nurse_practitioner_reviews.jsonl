While not having insurance I found myself in the hospital several time and treated for various illnesses.

I ended up back in the ER ...Brookwood because I felt uab were just treating emergency conditions with me...and not looking for what was connecting all my medical problems... I was given a list of providers and was told to get a primary doctor and make an appointment with a surgeon...before I could go home after my er visit Brookwood already had an appointment with a surgeon in three weeks.... I couldn\u2019t wait three weeks, but was impressed they followed up with making the appointment so fast...I called every dr on the list but no one had an opening less than a month away...so I decided to call Brandi Carboni office...    I am truly blessed to have found her, one look at me and she sent me to HER surgeon..( her words were you can\u2019t wait three weeks, you need a surgeon now).... not only got me I to see the surgeon in a few days but had three other dr offices call me in less than 24 hours making appointments for the other specialist I needed. She is so personable and truly interested and cares about her patients, even took my blood herself!!! My husband is going to use her as well!!!! It\u2019s so refreshing to be listened to, and treated like a person and not a number!!! I am convinced that I will be using her as my primary dr from now on! Staff is wonderful too.... not hard to get an appointment...no over crowded waiting rooms.... you\u2019re not rushed in and out so they can see the next person.... Her and her staff deserve more than five stars!!! .I\u2019ve had a history of medical problems all my life, countless drs and hospital last , here in the USA and overseas ... Brandi is far superior than anyone with the letters \u201cdr\u201d or \u201cmd\u201d in their name!!! Btw the her surgeon diagnosed me and apologized for the previous doctors when saying my case wasn\u2019t IMPORTANT... make a long story short I not only needed a surgeon but a plastic surgeon as well and the both will be preforming surgery on me (2 teams) at the same time to repair a hernia that reopened..my surgeon words were the same as Brandi saying this condition can not wait much longer...there are good and bad drs everywhere, it\u2019s important that you always feel comfortable ...
