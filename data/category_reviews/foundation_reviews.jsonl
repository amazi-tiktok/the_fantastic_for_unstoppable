The group is made up of dedicated professionals and highly skilled individual driven by high quality service comittment.\nThe repair MDH was hired to do was one that had been previously attempted by another foundation repair company. This was our second time addressing the same problem. While the first company ensured us the fix we paid for was permanent. It was short number of years later that we began seeing signs indicating the repair was failing . We found ourselves back at square one.\nAt the time we did not know MDH Foundation. We did reach out to the only other company we knew of thru advertisement only, and while we had someone come out assess and quote us a price, we chose to hold off. Very impressive sales presentation they did but we were just not convinced on their proposed corrective plan.  Some time later we hear of MDH, and a lot of good things being said of the owner, Mike Hayes. Not only on their foundation repair work, but as a very highly respectable contractor too.  Earlier this year we met with a member of the MDH team, and an assessment was made. Then before the job plan was finalized, the owner, Mike, came out to thoroughly go over the plan. It was the first time we felt really comfortable about the corrective plan.  Mike has a great group of professionals and skill guys that communicate well together. They were very attentive to our concerns, explained and answered every question.  They were punctual and respective of time. Always leaving area neat after each day.  We only wish we would have found MDH Foundation Repair the first time around.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594741068433, "text": "Thank you for your review.

We live in Ohio and are back in Sweet Home Alabama visiting family. We searched online for a fireworks display and our search led us to The American Village. We went a little early and enjoyed seeing the campus and tasting the delights of the food trucks:). Our family of 6 thought it awesome that there were seats if you didn\u2019t bring one or a blanket, picnics are allowed, and staff and volunteers were not only friendly but smiling and seemingly loving their roles!  This isn\u2019t your ordinary history museum and the fireworks display was definitely not typical. My husband is a retired Army Captain with 22 years in service. We have visited many places and viewed many fireworks displays including ones on military posts. None have even come close to what we experienced last night!  My favorite parts, the parts that gave me chills and made tears flow, was seeing the colors presented correctly, the heartfelt gratitude of The American Village staff towards Those who serve, and the accurate depiction of our historical relevance. Thank you American Village for making our Independence Day Celebration not only the best yet, but also helping us to reflect on just how wonderful it is to be an American!  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892951889d4a0d:0xd5b51426974ef905"}

If you live nearby or are driving through AL for any reason this is a MUST DO! Pack lunch or eat on the way because they don't serve food here but you can bring picnic lunch, and be sure to check the hours as well because they are not always open on every Saturday, but it is great when they are. Going on Presidents Day was a fantastic experience as well, nothing like getting to eat cupcakes with George Washington!!! The replica architecture is amazing it is really an incredible place to visit! You will want to spend the whole time there if you can and go to as many demonstrations as you can!

Was DEFINITELY the best of 3 quotes and was glad to hear about the \"Gravity System\" so no need for a pump install. I did alot of work myself to prepare for the job. Took down walls, studs, and anything in the way on the entire perimeter of my basement (1800 sq ft home). I also dug out a trench from my house to the edge of the yard (3ft deep by 1ft wide by 15ft long) for the drainage pipe. Had a grate installed on the front of my garage doors so no more water comes in garage. I had definitely been getting water coming in through the ground and was evident by the mold on the blocks in the garage before the system was in place. I have to say now almost a year later I haven't had a single drop come inside when it used to come in any time it would rain. However, I have periodically checked and have never seen the water come out of the drain pipe outside no matter how much or how hard it rains. I honestly don't know where the water is going but it's not coming inside. The reason BDry gets 3 stars is that the overall job works but is not 100%-I don't know where the water goes, the perimeter jackhammer/ concrete fill job isn't smooth and has cracks. The water drain panels put inside are wavy and needed to be more secure. The trim pieces weren't put in but left for me to do so it doesn't look like it should. Was about a 10k investment, I just hope that water isn't eroding my foundation underneath. I still smell wetness at times of rain aswell.
