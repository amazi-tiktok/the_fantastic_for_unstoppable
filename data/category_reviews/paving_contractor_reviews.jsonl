And when you continue to insist, the answer will be aggressive. 1. We ordered a calvert without asphalt coating.  Look at the photos, what they promised and what we got. 2. We ordered to bring sand to raise the level of the site. We didn't get a single loadful of sand. They just raked the mounds from the higher areas to the lower areas. At the same time, the entire site was threatened with flooding. He also blocked stormwater way. Rainwater has nowhere to go, the site was flooded.
