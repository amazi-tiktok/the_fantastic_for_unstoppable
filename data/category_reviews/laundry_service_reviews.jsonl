The lady that checked me in looked at the rug, consulted with another worker that was there at the time, gave me a ticket, and told me that the rug would be ready around the same time the following week. I called on November 14th to check the status of the rug. I was told \"Yes, the rug is ready, but we couldn't clean it.\" I asked her why did anyone not call me to let me know that it could not be cleaned? Basically all I got was an \"I don't know\" and some other pathetic excuse. I immediately proceeded to pick up my uncleaned rug that has just been sitting on a table for an entire week.\nFor the entire life of me, I do not understand why something as simple as a phone call did not happen. As soon as they saw that they could not accommodate, all they had to do was call and say, \"We apologize for the inconvenience, but we cannot clean your rug.\" I would have happily returned to pick up my rug and found another company to clean it. I am pretty sure that someone knew that Friday morning after I dropped off, that they would not be able to clean my rug. But NO, the rug just sat there until I called to check on it.  A simple phone call. Communication, communication, communication. Inconsideration and/or laziness. But regardless, there was absolutely no reason why I was not contacted.

The lady said it would be done on Friday. I asked for delivery service so I had to go inside and fill out a form.  Then there John or Jason said it would not be ready until Friday, which was fine since I will be out of town but there will be someone at home.  On Thursday night I received an automated voicemail at 9PM; that they would be delivering and picking up clothes on Friday.  Friday comes and goes with no delivery so I called at about 3:00 trying to find out what the problem was.  I was informed by an employee named Katie, that my clothes was ready but there would be no further delivery because \"everyone left for a family graduation\" the graduation for the owners son.  She said that she would leave a note to see about delivering on Saturday, that, \"it shouldn't be a problem\".  On Saturday we called to find what time they would deliver and no one was ever informed and that they don't deliver on Saturday.  My husband had to go to pick up the clothes and was told there was a shirt not ready.  He was told that they would deliver the missing shirt on Monday.  On Monday we called about the shirt and was now told that they do not deliver to our location until Tuesday.  We got the shirt on Tuesday and John (or Jason) called my husband to say the shirt was delivered, trying to apologize.  Unfortunately I had to call him back because he told my husband things that were totally wrong.\nThe bottom line is that this business has a very long way to go to on customer service.  Family companies are great but there is no reason that one order should have so many untruths told in order to cover up for the fact that they left on Friday.  Additionally, all employees need to be able to talk to the companies policies, even if they are only part-time employees.

Since, your garments were dropped off at our cutoff time, 9:30am, and needed back three hours later by 12:30pm, they were not able to receive the attention needed to remove the stains you had in them. We pretreated your shirts for the stains but in order to meet your deadline needs it was not possible to achieve perfection. We would be happy to do them over for no charge at all but we would need the time to soak them since the stains are set in. Next time you are in a time crunch give us a heads up and we should be able to help you out or send to a respectable clothier to dress you with a few shirts.\n\nSincerely,\nJosh Watkins\nOwner"}, "gmap_id": "0x888917ae69c629e1:0xb6cf920e0bc0fd0a"}
