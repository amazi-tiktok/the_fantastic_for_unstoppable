I asked specifically for information on my next visit and what to expect. I was told come alone it\u2019s just a ultrasound. But when I got there they asked, \u201cWhere is your spouse?\u201d After taking birth control for months and going through the process they would not see us for a last minute appointment because we had our kids even though we were already in the office. Even though it was their fault we didn\u2019t have time to get childcare because they told us to come singular when we both needed to be at the appointment.\nOverall awful experience for a couple trying to conceive.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197bec012587:0x7d5f5781c4c6b6bf"}
