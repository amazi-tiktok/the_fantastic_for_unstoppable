Their rates are ridiculous (because they are the only choice for residents of Arab when it comes to electricity. We either give them our money or have no power), their staff is rude and will either act like it is some monumental task to answer simple questions or just pass you off to a guy who I am guessing is a supervisor but certainly doesn't act like one.\n\nThey charge you extra if you want to pay with a debit card and even though the vast majority of the population they serve falls into a very low income bracket, they offer no sort of assistance in the scorching summer when we have to run our A/Cs constantly or die of heat stroke, resulting in outlandish bills some of us struggle to pay (more on that below).\n\nTheir website is also a downright shame as websites go and shouldn't even be taking up space on the Internet. It has zero useful information - other than a contact phone number and address- even though the paragraph on the welcome page blatantly says to email them with comments or suggestions. I thought I would do just that but found no email address listed anywhere.\n\nThere are plenty of links across the top, referencing everything from how to understand your bill, levelized billing, member services (it is supposed to be a co-op, HA.) and energy saving tips. These would all be very useful links if they ACTUALLY WORKED. The only link out of all those that works is the one for payment methods.\n\nCurious, I called the office to ask if they offered levelized billing, as a link on their site was titled just that, though it only defaulted to the 'payment methods' page, which listed the usual cash, check money order, blah blah, and not a single thing about levelized billing. The woman who answered sounded annoyed just saying hello and sighed heavily at my question before transferring me to a man, who answered my question about levelized billing with a flippant 'nope'.\n\nMaybe they should re-do their website and remove the link for levelized billing if they do not offer it. Better yet, I think they should just get rid of the site altogether. It's just a waste of a Web developer's time- and a waste of customers' time- to have a link filled website alluding to all these things the Co op supposedly offers when the links are dead in the water and the company doesn't actually offer any of those things.\n\nBad Web design makes Baby Jesus cry. And poor customer service makes customers wish for a better company to handle their electricity needs.\n\n*Edit* My original review was written three years ago and a check of their website today shows that they have redesigned it. The links now work and they have responsibly removed the dead link for the levelized billing they don't offer.\n\nHowever, the third-party payment site they use is down, which means I am going to have to call and deal with their rude local staff to know how much my bill is. I could wait for it to arrive in the mail, but unlike most responsible companies, they do not have a paperless billing option and by the time I get the paper invoice, it is already well into the month and only ten days away from the due date. As  I get paid monthly, I like to get my biggest bills paid (my electric bill is alway the most expensive of all my bills by far) as soon as I get my paycheck so I can better budget for the remainder of the month.\n\nAlso, power outages have been rampant the past six months and their staff has yet to learn even the most basic of customer service etiquette, so my star rating stays the same.\n\nBottom line: If you are looking into Arab as a potential place to live, I would suggest taking the many bad reviews of the only option you're going to have for power into heavy consideration before moving here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889e6793690f5ff:0xd161c5183a8e9664"}

Box 1246, Bessemer AL. 35020\n\nDear Madam:\nI am writing to dispute a billing error in the amount of $1,148.05 on my account. This amount is egregious and boldly inaccurate, because I have not resided at the above property since July 31, 2016. It is in your billing responsibilities to have contacted me prior to 3 years after the delinquency.\nIt also states in your Bessemer Utilities Code of Ordinance , Code 1995; Ord. No. 2425; Section #110-51 Billing; line (h) and (i)\n(h)  A notice will be mailed no earlier than two business days after the due date advising the customer that their bill has not been paid. This notice will advise the customer that the late charge has been added and that an additional ten days has been granted.\n(i)  If the bill is not paid, service will be discontinued. Such notice shall contain instructions on how to apply for a hearing if the bill is disputed or if the customer is in financial distress and unable to pay the bill. If the customer fails to respond either with payment or by notifying the utility, disputing the amount of the bill, or by advising the office of the customer's inability to pay, service will be discontinued as scheduled.\nI have printed confirmation from USPS showing that I had a change of address active with priority forwarding  from 8/31/16-8/31/17. During this time I never received ANY correspondence from Bessemer Utilities.\nI also find it Unbelievable and Incredulous that Bessemer Utilities would allow a customer 11 months of service without payment, prior to disconnecting service. Especially when your code of ordinance states otherwise.\nMeanwhile you have been billing the current owner of the residence, an acquaintance of mine, as well.\nI am requesting that the error be corrected, that any finance and/or charges related to the disputed amount including my $300+ deposit be credited back to me immediately.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888de264d0e85a7:0x3bd37d0f7e68f65e"}

Aside from customer service complaints. I have had nothing but great customer service. At times it took a bit to get back to me but during a hurricane we moved in. Yes they lost power yes it took time to restore it . Yes they use utility poles to provide much of the power.  Unless you want your power to be 3 times what it is.  Power is a 30yr investment.  Power companies usually do not balance on your install for 30 Years!! Think about that. if you want everything underground than think of paying double to three times your power bill.   Now in new developments the cost of installing underground services is much much lower and shared with the developer.  This provided around the same of less cost than using utility poles.  Trust me if it was up to Riviera they would have everything but transmission underground. Maybe even that too.  I have worked at power companies in the past and we had a major outage. An Ice storm knocked out 92% of our ratepayers 92%! We also lost our cell phone service and radios.  Thanks ATT.  We had to drive out of the area to use a sprint cell phone to call for help.   The same was done here.  Help came from out of town linemen(Persons). I drove around and looked at both there restoration and BEMC. It takes time and hard work to restore everyone and they did.  In our area we had to have multiple trees removed just to start clearing the line. Sure I would have liked power back faster.  You have to be reasonable. They do care and so do the staff. You end up working 16-18 hr days depending on rest and sometimes end up sleeping in odd places.  Just to get services restored. They do work very hard to get the job done. Keep it up and keep working on it. !!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43c470376889:0xc955ca1395e4ef36"}

Because they hold a monopoly over every single person that lives in Scottsboro they can get away with charging whatever they feel like charging, resulting in surprise bills that make life substantially harder for all of the low income families that reside here.
