I have had Beltone hearing aids before and got this upgrade.  The personnel at the Cullman office were super.  They were always attentive to my questions, friendly and pleasant and full of knowledge.  The hearing aid that was suggested for my problem has been wonderful.  It is clearer that any aid I have had before and I can now hear more clearly that in years.  I also got the remote control, which is the best thing since sliced bread.  The program that reduces background noise is my favorite.  When we go to a restaurant, I simply click to that program and I can hear those at my table clearly and not be distracted by the noise in the restaurant.  I have used this program at other places also, but it is most noticeable in restaurants. (Maybe it is because we eat out a lot)  I would highly recommend this hearing aid and the Cullman outlet for anyone that needs a hearing aid.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cb86831f2ef5:0xf0782039ba315f7f"}

I had been wearing older Starkey hearing aids for about 4 years so hearing aids was not a new experience to me.\n\nAfter some research I decided to accept Tony's offer for the Via AI aids.  At the first appointment Tony Set up the aids and the Thrive APP on my phone.  I like being able to change setting on the aids through the app.  We found that there is an issue using iPhone 6 and older phones with the app due to Apple upgrading the iOS after i6.  It does work for now but it tends to drop connecting with the aids.  When it does you close the app and restart it.\n\nDuring both sessions Tony got assistance from an outside consultant with questions that I had raised.  On the second session Tony moved the settings closer to my ideal setting\n\nOverall I do hear better than I did with the old aids.\n\nAt all times Tony acted in a professional manner.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580944477360, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review!

He showed me the CT scan and explained how my deviated septum and enlarged turbinates were swelling and causing not only pain but blockage which wasn't allowing mucus out or helpful medications in! He suggested a septoplasty with turbinate reduction.\nMy surgery was November 16, 2016 and I have had continually improving symptoms.
