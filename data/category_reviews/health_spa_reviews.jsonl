You are a cork on the water, it's impossible to sink.

This was my first time, but I signed the waiver online that they sent to me via email before arriving. They explained the experience to me at a little lobby area with table and chairs, and they gave me some sandals to wear instead of shoes. Then they escorted me to my room, probably about 8x12 (Edit: 8x16 feet per owner response below) feet in size. They show you the preparations you should take on the wall in the room and a few things about operating the pod. They provide everything you need right down to a contacts case and solution. It's a sensory deprivation chamber, but you can choose to have music on in the pod if you prefer. I was in for about an hour. Good experience. They give you everything you need, but it's up to you to relax while floating in the filtered and heavily salted (Epsom salt) water. Afterward, you can go back to the lobby area and are offered a healthy variety of hot tea to continue relaxing. The person in charge joined me for a nice chat, and I left.
