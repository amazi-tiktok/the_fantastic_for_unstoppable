I wanted him to quote a deck build and privacy fence. I was looking for options on building the deck and he was visibly frustrated that I just didn't have a set design for him to quote. As an engineer and a business owner I understood that, but thats often part of the process. Then he mentioned he would reuse the existing rotted ledger board on the house. I kept my mouth shut but I was definitely on guard after he said that. Next I wanted him to quote a wooden privacy fence around a pool. We came to an area that required a metal section of fence across my driveway.  He told me it wasn't an option to use anchor bolts on concrete for the posts.  As someone he has a fair amount of experience about anchoring I flat out told him it was if he did it correctly.  Once again he got very irate. Then he told me it would take $7000 to cover the 60' section of driveway.  I pointed out that the metal section across the driveway is the same width as the 20' wide pool I wanted to fence off - it does not require anywhere near 60' of fence to go across a 2-car wide driveway. He got mad again when I told him this - but, I mean it's just so obvious.  He stormed off, saying he and I weren't going to get along and I could find someone else. A frustrating waste of time and certainly did not inspire confidence in me that this contractor was competent. He may in fact be competent, but with people skills like that you might never know for sure.

I ordered a tube where i can fit my electrical fish rod tools but to my surprise, the product arrives with no end caps.  All while the product picture has end caps, which is basically false advertisement.  So let me get this straight, your customers are coming to your site to buy an empty tube with no end caps?  I can conveniently drive to home depot and get a random pipe for that.  Or even ask my neighbor.  How about putting it in capital letters on your site  that \"the tube doesn't come with end caps.\"  Then it would be up to the customer to read and do the proper product research.\n\nBut wait there's more.  So i was already super irritated at the lack of logic being used on this one but i refrained from writing a bad review.  Instead, I brushed it off, went on the website, and found I can just order these vynil end caps for $2, plus shipping.  Whatever! Right?  It happens!\n\nBut my disappointment didn't stop there.  I received the package, opened it and only one cap was inside.  Again, the product page is titled \"black vynil caps\" and the first picture is a picture of multiple caps.  So once again, misleading a returning customer that already gave you a second chance.  Where is the logic?  I am certain that you have run into this problem before.  Why is it not fixed.  You risk reputational damage for a few extra bucks.\n\nI just don't understand how your number one priority isn't to make life easier for your customers and delighting them at every step of the sales process....

I first told them that I wasn't going to sue them I just wanted them to know to fix the bolt so it couldn't be removed just adjusted.They never would let me explain what actually happened. They just kept saying they didn't make that part. It is SAD that someone will have to get killed to resolve this. I was just trying to save a family some grief. I called my dealer and my new part was on the way in ten minutes.That is how you do it, T AND H MARINE.Your products are great but your success has blinded you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88627ab2ae7c2605:0xae27bd21ff2912c2"}

The very affordable rates make the location a win to begin with.  The massive capacity of this large and expanding boatyard is another positive, though they graciously made room for me even in the midst of the fallout of Hurricane Sally .  However, perhaps the best aspect of the facility are the brilliant array of professionals associated with it who are able to attend to any matter that one might face.  Though I intended to perform all the work on my boat, I was delighted to find both excellent, generous guidance and reliable, experienced service providers to attend to all my needs that were beyond my own capacity.  I suppose that is to be expected from a business operated by four generations of one family!   I will be gladly returning from Pensacola for routine maintenance every two years!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ58ZoKyLU0TWUS0EaU2yQhUT2W_vfqgKg3LLg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a1a57fd97f7e1:0x4ea54057c0d4d474"}
