So I asked for a minute to handle it after paying hospital bills and fines and such and I received rude treatment and no time to handle it. Then my hours dropped at work due to covid-19 and I was unable to do it within the time frame. So I just decided to move out and deal with the move out costs. I was treated horribly after doing so and today I received a call from Mr.Rosengarten who cussed on the phone with me and acted like my problems don\u2019t matter. I told him that they were supposed to take off late fees but they never did (I wasn\u2019t sure if that would help take down the balance a little bit) and he was incredibly mean to me about the fact that that wasn\u2019t enough and that I was confused about that.

There were only two tenants living in the apartment this summer, and both of us were gone a minimum of 8 hours a day, often more. The lights were kept off, the dishwasher not used, and the A/C set accordingly. Every month we were charged at least $20 extra for power. I went to the front desk and asked to see my bill and requested an inspection to see why our bill was so high. The representative was friendly and submitted my request on July 8th. My request was not completed until July 30th, two days after the power bill had been posted. In the report they filed, there was not a single note for me to read about if they found a reason the bill was high or anything of the subject. Keep in mind the other tenants who are not residing here are also having to pay for these power overages. It has been extremely frustrating dealing with these issues. We are all college students with other bills the pay, and it feels like every day I look I have another charge on my account. On top of rent you have to pay $4 a month for pest control, another $4 a month for utility billing, and if you don't have renters insurance it's $12 a month.

They pick and choose which parts of the lease they want to follow, most of the front desk staff is either extremely rude or doesn't know what they're doing. By the time I turned in my keys we were on the 3rd general manager if that tells you anything about the staff here. Maintenance requests were constantly deleted or cancelled by staff. Was told I could store my stuff in an apartment before move-in day and was also informed that I would not be living there, so imagine my surprise when they stuck my preferred roommate in there. Holes in the walls, infants, and drugs everywhere. When I came back for move-in day I was told that maintenance would help me move my stuff, instead, the manager at the time helped me move trash bags filled with not only my stuff, but with actual trash as well. Absolutely ridiculous. Charged a $65 move-out cleaning fee that they wrote in in the special provisions tab which I was told covered the price of someone coming in to scrub the toilets and bathtub. Really? $65 for something I had already done? Also got stuck with a $50 carpet cleaning fee. When I inquired about this additional $50 fee I was not told what was actually wrong with the carpet and then hung up on by the first person, and then told by the assistant manager that typically if someone lives there for a year the carpets just have to be cleaned. So be prepared for that if you choose to live in this fresh hell. This place is just NOT worth the price! I'd much rather live in my car.\n\nRoommate matching is a TOTAL fraud. Got stuck with the messiest, craziest people. I'm trying to go to school and get out, not listen to a bunch of psychos partying in my place until 3am and bringing drugs in and out 24/7. Was told that my roommates nor I could be in the apartment when we had our one TERRIBLE roommate move out. She had keys for 4 days when only permitted by law to have them for 2, did not have to pay the transfer fee that the rest of us were told we would have to pay if we chose to move, also stole from my roommates and destroyed personal property as well as attempted to destroy appliances. Wasn't in school, burned the couch with her curling iron, which the rest of us got charged for upon move-out, abused her two dogs that she didn't pay for, and was constantly smoking weed with all of her friends. Tried to blame me for her drugs and friends, and only after we called the police did she decide to go to the office and say that she was too scared to live with us, and to top it all off call us all racist while she made racial remarks to us the entire time she lived with us. Got a call from Kenyatta telling us that they had \"proof\" that we were racist. Talked to corporate manager about this disgusting accusation and was told that nobody thought that we were racist and seemed confused as to why I was there.

They are overpriced with their made up electric overages and will not repair anything unless the parent actually calls. Ms. Kenyatta seemed to be very helpful from the very beginning but upon moving out apparently she became frustrated and was very mean to my daughter so I begin dealing with her.\n\nThey will overcharge for things that you never even heard of and its ridiculous that they rip off young adults that are becoming the future.  They tell you one thing then do the next. I think they would be better if they were to increase their customer service skills and explain to tenants their procedure upon moving out. They will create charges like never before and will repeatedly tell you that its going on your credit. I think they actually enjoy that part.\n\nAlso there were shooting incidents in the parking lot and the only response they could give was \"everything is fine\" we will have security to patrol the area. It seems to me they should have been more proactive. The shooting was the last straw for me.\n\nIf you move here make sure you take pictures upon moving in and moving out.  Try not be so needy.

Upon moving out, I turned the air off; as I was NOT going to be paying overages when I'm not even living there. (My overages were around 20-40 bucks a month) They were high and very inconsistent. I would have an overage of 30 bucks or so in the month of December. (I was home 90% of that month and the air would be off and windows cracked) Then in the middle of July, air on, windows closed, my overage was around 7 dollars. Makes no sense.\nSo I move out, turned the air off, left my apartment clean. I get a text from my ex-roommate saying that there was mold all over the place. Myself being the last one there, I was charged with a $7,000 dollar statement for cleaning that tiny, tiny apartment. That's enough money to clean an entire 2 story house with mold worse than that.\nNot to mention that maintenance barges in whenever they please (email or not), dogs are off-leash everyday.

Do not stay here if you are planning on sleeping whatsoever. Constantly getting bogus overages for charges that were not my responsibility was a major issue.

However, I HAD to choose something. This place is a sorry excuse for \u201cLuxury Student Living\u201d. I had so many issues in my time here.\nSo, upon getting my keys and finally getting to go look, I went in and did my little checklist when I noticed that there were very gross yellow and green stains on the base boards behind my toilet. They came and cleaned it, no problem. (still disgusting)\nThen the AC went out in the MIDDLE of the summer. It got up to almost 85 degrees in there if I remember correctly. Took maintence almost 2-3 days to come and assist. (Only for it to happen again a few months later)\n*ATTENTION PET OWNERS* If you have a dog with ANY types of social anxiety, this is NOT the place for you. They have a \u201cleash law\u201d in their lease stating that all dogs must be on leashes at all times. BUT 99% of the people that live there DO NOT follow this rule. Their dogs run away from them and don\u2019t listen when their owner calls. I had my dog ATTACKED right in front of my apartment one day from someone not having their dog on a leash. Management did nothing but send out a small email about it.. and getting your $250 back from your deposit takes up to 4-5 months to come to you.\nNow, I need to get this out there so you guys can see what kind of people they hire. One day, I heard BANGING on my door.  It took me all but about 3 seconds to get there before they were already unlocking my door and coming in. I get to the door, and my dog is doing what he does best and investigating the people coming in his home. He comes up with a toy in his mouth and sniffs their feet, very friendly,wagging his tail. THEN the guy that was with a girl to do the inspection, puts his hand on my dog\u2019s chest and SHOVES him back(20 lbs dog) and tells me to \u201cwatch my dog...\u201d From there, this man straight up went in my room, opened all of my drawers to my chest of drawers, all of my cabinets in my bathroom, snooped in my closet, and did the same exact thing to my roommate\u2019s room as well and left EVERY light on and EVERYthing open. NOT TO MENTION they are supposed to email you a notice about inspections. I did NOT get one for that day or hardly any others.\nThem being able to come in if someone doesn\u2019t answer the door is just a huge invasion of privacy in my opinion. Imagine getting out of the shower or being IN the shower and not being able to hear your door being knocked on and someone comes in your apartment.. a stranger at that.\nTowing has a $250 fine PLUS its like a 30-45 minute drive to the super sketchy, very obviously cheap towing company where the staff is insanely rude.\nOVERAGES. Always, always about 20-30 dollars in overages every single month. No matter if you weren\u2019t there for all of a month (like December for example\u2026 Christmas time)\nSo, I moved out at the beginning of March in a rush to leave that place for multiple reasons. I get a call (in July) from management saying that there is a HUGE mold issue in my apartment due to \u201cexcessive moisture\u201d. I cleaned my apartment from head to toe before I left. Down to vacuuming, sweeping and mopping. And left it just how I found it, except probably better. I received pictures, and the mold is EVERY where\u2026 ceiling, baseboards, couch, chair, walls.. you name it. And they are blaming ME for it. It is all due to the AC closet in my bedroom that has an oddly direct flow from outdoor air. I even mentioned that I had turned my air off to someone at the front desk before I left and was told, and I quote, \u201cOh that\u2019s perfectly fine! No problem!\u201d Now, If I hadn\u2019t had the overage problem the whole time, I would have left it on anyways. But I just do not see the point in paying overages for not living there in the first place.\nPLEASE read these comments, guys. They WILL rob you of your money... DO NOT DO IT. Paying this much (about 1400 for a small two bedroom apartment w/ overages) with this much of a hassle just to be so close to South is NOT worth it. Clock an extra 10-15 minute drive and live somewhere much better and worth your time and money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532302173113, "text": "Hi FreetoFly16 - Thank you for your review and feedback.

It asks us to rate it with a star, and I cannot figure out why there aren't any stars on the negative side of zero.  My daughter moved in there for college 2 years ago this past August and at first all seemed fine, but as time went by my thoughts on that changed.  My daughter was charged overages every single month and there was never an understanding as to why.  Maintenance would pop in whenever they wanted without any kind of a notice and I do mean POP in.  We got something for her door so she couldn't be surprised unannounced again.  She decided to move out towards the beginning of the year.  She was paid up in rent, so as soon as she found her a better place she moved all of her belongings out and cleaned the apartment from top to bottom.  The apartment was 100% clean and ready  for a new tenant.  My daughter turned the air off when she left because that's what one does when no one will be living there.  Fast forward maybe 2-3 months..........She gets a lengthy letter from them demanding $7,000 in damages because of mold!  Her little apartment had mold from ceiling to floor, all on the walls, in the cabinets, in the toilet, all over the furniture, everywhere!   Any and everywhere was covered in mold.  It was unbelievable!  Her ex-roommate sent her pictures and I'm here to tell you it was disgusting,  but it was not my daughter's wrong doing or fault that caused this.  I am not one to bad mouth anyone, but if the shoe fits, you wear it!!  My question is what is wrong with a buildings structure or inner walls to make a room become so overwhelmingly engulfed in mold in such a short period of time?  What has been behind these walls all this time?  Is this why my daughter's nose stayed stopped up?  Is this why she was always sneezing?  Lots of questions are coming to mind.  I could understand if my daughter was being negligent or irresponsible, but that simply is not the case here.  They are now holding us responsible for their problem.  Do NOT let your child live here.  It is NOT what it seems.  The people who consider themselves to be \"in charge\" take advantage of our children because they know that most children straight out of high school are easily mis-lead and easy to screw over.  They figured wrong when speaking about my daughter.  So many kids live here and the bills are paid without question from \"mama and daddy's\" bank account, and most parents don't even think or ask to see a bill probably.  I wonder how much money they make in one month alone in overages??  Imagine how much in a year.  It's ridiculous!  Do yourself and your child a favor and look elsewhere.  Oh!!! and don't be fooled by the good reviews from the tenants.  That's the new ones who were promised a little gift card for writing a good review.\nSusan Sumrall", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}

Honestly I'm not sure why they got rid of it because it was probably the only good publicity they would get.\nThis review is kind of long, if you don't read the stories, at least read the last two paragraphs.\n\nWithin the first two months of living here, I realized that this place was awful. If I had this semester to do over again, I would definitely have opted for the hour commute each day. Seriously, even on-campus living would be better than here.\n\nIt feels like they could care less about your satisfaction once they have you locked in to a lease. There was a time a few months ago where I went 3-4 days without internet. (Internet outages happen really often here) I was working on a homework assignement when it just quit working. I figured out that it wasn't my router, but a problem with comcast (who were super helpful and friendly when  I called). Comcast told me that they see the problem but were unable to do anything about it unless they had an employee tell them to reboot. So I call CQ get transferred to someone saying they were the manager and explained to her what Comcast said only to be cut off and informed that it was a Friday afternoon and the office was closed. But I still paid for utilities that month, right? Oh well, they don't care.\n\nOver Christmas break, my roommates and I were gone almost the entire month. When we left, we turned the AC and all the lights off and were still charged $20 overages a piece. How does that work?\n\nMost recently, I woke up one Sunday to my air conditioning and fan not working. So I check the thermostat to see if I can fix it, nothing. Luckily my parents were coming over to visit that day so I asked my dad to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong on the thermostat, still wouldn't work. So we call CQ (seriously it's July and it's hotter in my apartment than outside) and ask for someone to come fix the AC. That was around 3:00pm Sunday. They said they'd have someone come out to look at it that day. No one showed up until the next morning when i got back from class around 10am. I had to sleep on my couch with 3 fans blowing on me (I've been on more comfortable camping trips). Got charged a huge overage for this too.\n\nOh and my favorite part is when the maintanance guy mentioned above comes in to fix my fan. He stands on a chair in my room and tells me to flip the switch. Nothing happens. Then he spins the fan with his and a few times and tells me to call if i have any more problems. I don't think he made it to his car before it quit spinning.\n\nSeriously this place is a joke. Students reading this, you can do better. Parents, don't let your kids move somewhere they'll have this many problems with.\n\nP.s. They go in your room whenever they please. Granted, they knock first, but I have heard them knock and go into my empty roommates' rooms before. Honestly, this makes me uncomfortable.  And this part might be too much information, but one day coming home from class I see one of the maintenance workers going door to door and it looks like he had just come out of my apartment. Myself or my roommates haven't been there all day, but when I go in, there was an unbearable smell. He had used my bathroom.\n\nI'm sure not many people will take time to read this, but if I could tell you one thing it would be - when you come to visit try to come in and walk around the complex and ask people you see walking around their honest opinions and if they would recommend living here. I'd be willing to bet that there's more negative than positive answers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}
