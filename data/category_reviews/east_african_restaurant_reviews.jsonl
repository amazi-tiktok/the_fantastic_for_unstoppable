Anyone else find this astoundingly amazing?\n\nFrom the moment we walked in to the moment we left we had permanent smiles. And so did the owner. He greeted us with such joy and enthusiasm right from the start. Our service was prompt. He offered suggestions for appetizers and even treated us to one because he was so excited for us to taste African food for the first time. Neither of us had ever tried goat before so we both ordered the goat entrees. My goat stew was so tender and delicious, with spices I've never tasted before in a stew. We ordered almost all of the side dishes, all of which were absolutely incredible. Our host popped in occasionally to tell us how to pair certain sides with out entrees and he was always so happy to see us enjoy our meal. He even took some time to tell stories about his grandfather. It wasn't long before a friend of his sat down near us and began to make conversation. It really is the sort of environment where anyone could step in and immediately be a friend to everyone within 20 yards of them.  We will be back here in no time. Probably the best experience we have had at a restaurant here in Birmingham.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889194c9558a611:0x2a7a084d998ac6a2"}
