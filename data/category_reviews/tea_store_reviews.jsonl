(Their loose leaf teas come in bags that can also act as tea strainers in a pinch, which is pretty great.) The loose leaf teas come with instructions for how to brew a cup of hot tea, a jar of iced tea, or even as a bigger batch if you're brewing for a large group. This location has coffee as well.\n\nI've always had the friendliest service at Piper & Leaf \u2014 they take time to hear you out, help you find the tea that will work best for you, and make sure you leave happy.

They were very unwelcoming and had a bad attitude the entire time. This is completely unprofessional and I have never experienced such bad customer service.

These places are absolute rip offs. I tried it about 2 weeks ago and now all I have been seeing online is how (1) unhealthy these places actually are and (2) that they are MLMs. This definitely seemed like one of those... There were no prices listed and they convinced my fianc\u00e9 to get a \u201ccombo\u201d with a tea and peanut butter shake. On our way out, they told him that the shake isn\u2019t \u201cchalky\u201d at all. It definitely was and didn\u2019t taste like peanut butter at all. Paid almost $30 for something we just ended up throwing out. AND they asked us to promote them on instagram. I won\u2019t be returning, especially since they weren\u2019t wearing masks while preparing the drinks. Who knows what I drank, it tasted like cough medicine.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615926085689, "text": "Thank you for bringing these issues to our attention. We are sorry you were not satisfied with our products. If you should decide to give us another chance, please ask for one of the owners and we will make it right. In addition, we will be happy to show you the labels for every item that goes into our teas and shakes so you know exactly what you are consuming. We never \"force\" or \"convince\" anyone to get anything they don't want. We don\u2019t serve anything to our customers that we don\u2019t drink daily ourselves. As far as a the \"chalky\" taste, non of our shakes are chalky but they are in fact protein shakes (this is a nutrition shop, not McDonalds or Starbucks where you get a milkshake loaded with sugar).
