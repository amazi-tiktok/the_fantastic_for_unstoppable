We're sorry that the final results of your scanning order did not meet your expectations.  We pride ourselves on giving each order personal attention and all of the work we do is done in our Birmingham location (in the historic Avondale neighborhood).\nWe recall your order very clearly.  You chose our PROOF quality (700 ppi) for your slide scanning order, which our lowest resolution (and lowest priced).  We also offer ARCHIVE quality scans (1700 ppi) at a slighlty higher cost.  Our scanning service, whether Proof or Archive level, includes the utilization of dust removal software, which can remove superficial debris and blemishes on the scanned images.\nOur technician specifically noted the high concentration of dust on your slides before scanning your slides.  Prior to scanning your order, our tech  attempted to manually clean each of your slides by hand to remove the dust and lint you described.  Unfortunately, dust and lint are often stuck to the film itself and may not be removed except by rewashing or physically wiping the film with a chemical solution.\nWe are generally unwilling to do such aggressive cleaning, out of fear we might damage our clients irreplaceable originals.  More often, if the condition of the originals is so bad that our usual cleaning and post-production are insufficient, we can do restorastion to the scanned images.  This digital retouching is not inexpensive, but for extremely valuable or badly deteriorated images, it is often the best option.\nAgain, we're sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied with our service.
