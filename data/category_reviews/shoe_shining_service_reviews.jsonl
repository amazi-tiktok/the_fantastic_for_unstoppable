Very pleasant and repaired a gash that I thought was not repairable. In addition, I had a pair of boots with a rubber edge I didn't wear because of the wear. After about 45 seconds, the entire boot looked brand new. Going forward, they will be doing all of mine and my wife's show polishing and repair.
