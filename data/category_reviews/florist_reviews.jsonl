Now picture this that baby is a  still born. Did your heart just break? Ours did in so many ways! I would NEVER do a bad review because I also am a business owner. Rules change when a business just flat out doesn't care and I believe it is time to take action. As a business owner in the fashion world I deal with brides a lot. If my staff makes a mistake and sends out a bride the wrong shoes, I personally will take action to fix it. A wedding is a very crucial time for a woman and if that means I have to come out of my pocket to next day those shoes, I will! if that means I have to go out in the hot warehouse and pull those shoes, I will! I will move heaven and earth so I make sure that bride has a special day! The reason is that day is planned and can't be moved.  Now, you are in the flower business! A mother has a still born baby! A whole family is crushed! You would think that a business owner would also move heaven and earth when a mistake is made. This is another crucial day that can't be changed! This business acted like it was NO BIG DEAL that this banner wasn't made in time for this baby's funeral. It was also said that they couldn't deliver the banner to the funeral side. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? As a business owner I would of driven it out there myself! I would of been so sincere on the phone, and made the banner myself! I would of called other customers and explained that their flowers may be late due to a heartbreaking situation. I would of hired on extra staff or stayed up all night to make this banner. Each time my friend called the owner was RUDE to her as if she was bothering her! I am sorry but this is so unprofessional on so many levels! To own a business is to own up to mistakes and FIX them ASAP! After many phone calls we finally got a banner and it is TACKY and UGLY and honestly I could of done better myself! Shame Shame on this business owner! If you are going to take on the responsibilities of a business you should always put customer service FIRST! So I would suggest any bride or anyone who may have a special day to think twice before putting your special day plans in this business owners hands. Maybe this owner needs to take some classes on how to run a business professionally. To learn customer service and how to treat people who are sensitive to make their day easier not harder.

My wife and I are not in Auburn so we chose this company to deliver an arrangement for Valentines Day for my mother-in-law in Opelika. We ordered a higher dollar item other than the lower priced special. Specifically for the reason of having more fruit and less chocolate as we were hoping for something a bit healthier because of health issues. They charged our credit card for the higher priced item we ordered but delivered the lower price special with added chocolate and it was a smaller item. In addition to the wrong item - they did not deliver it on Valentines Day. We called several times and they acted nice at first and promised to deliver the item the next day. Late in the day mom called and said it was never delivered. We called back and it was being delivered late in the day - a day late - and it was the wrong item, not the higher priced one we paid for.\n\nWe called again and one of the employees admitted they went to the wrong house on Valentines day so somebody got the higher priced item. My wife called again to at least get a refund for the overcharged amount or to have the right item delivered. We were promised the right item would be delivered. The next day, no delivery.\n\nAt this point, several days after Valentines Day my wife gave up so I started calling, was promised a refund or a deliver of the right item. There was no refund or proper delivery. I was then promised at least a call back from the owner, then another promise, another promised call back. I never heard back.\n\nMy mother in law never received the correct item and and we never got the refund. We finally tried to cancel payment with credit card and to get a refund but they disputed it - said that the item was delivered. Did not mention that it was the wrong item, and that it was late, missing Valentines Day. I'm sorry that they delivered the item, possibly twice, to the wrong house, and then the wrong item to the right address. That's three deliveries, three trips, three items. However, those mistakes are not our fault. All I know is that my mother in law never received what was ordered.\n\nI would not recommend this company to another person.\n\nI would probably have written a different review if the owner would have called me back as promised by the several employees.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2ce2392dbe3:0xba2152bd50d19c00"}

I, along with my parents and even my grandparents, have used them for a number of occasions over the years. We often used them in Student Council at DHS as well. However, I won\u2019t be using them again going fruther.\n\nI currently live in a different city, but I recently called Simpson\u2019s to inquire about having flowers sent to my mother for Mother\u2019s Day and had an encounter with a employee by the name of Anne that left me dissatisfied. While she might have appeared quite polite by her tone, she came across fairly condescending when I asked if they might be delivereing on the day of the holiday this year. I consider it extremely poor customer service to make any customer feel as if their questions are unwarranted, especially if they\u2019re legitimate. Many florists do deliver on Mother\u2019s Day even if they are normally closed on Sunday because it\u2019s a popular holiday for flowers. She even infomred me they themselves did previously deliver the day of Mother\u2019s Day, but no longer do. So it couldn\u2019t have been that absurd of a question.\n\nPreviously, I had no particular preference for either Simpson\u2019s or their other main competitor in town, but going forward I will be doing all of my business with their competitor. It\u2019s not only important to sound polite when interacting with customers, but also it\u2019s just as important to connect and be personable when engaging with customers.

I feel that I should be able to pick out  a picture of the flowers and container that I would like to purchase, pay for it, and have it delivered. When I order an item, let's say a new chair,  I can see a photo of the  chair and know what I am paying for ,and when it arrives it should be the chair I ordered. I don't like paying for something that is NOT what I ordered. While I understand fresh flowers may need to be substituted the arrangement should resemble the photo. Flowers should be similar and the container should be exact.  A container should not be in a photo on the website if it is not \" in stock\". This is false advertising. Each individual florist probably doesn't have what is pictured on the Teleflora websites.\nI called the florist and expressed my concern and followed up with an email with pictures of what I ordered and what was delivered.  I ordered a beautiful sturdy white wicker basket with flowers and what I got was a cheap multicolored Easter egg basket. They substituted the basket and after I complained they were willing to offer me a credit of $2.50. What a joke!  I will not use this florist in the future for any reason and will never use a site that is managed by Teleflora. My thoughts are that the Teleflora company has way too many florist and they do not know what each flower shop has in stock. So when you order from a site like this one, you NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET. BEWARE. I wish I could put a photo on this commentary. I paid $45.73 for something that was NOT what I ordered.  Here is the response from the florist:\n\nThank you for your recent order. We pride ourselves on delivering the best, most fresh and most similar arrangements that we can for our customers and we have been doing so for over 38 year in the Shoals area! I am very glad you were pleased with the flowers that we provided for you and your mother.\n\nIn response to your recent request for a 50% refund here is our answer:\nThe basket chosen was unavailable and a similar value was substitute per our substitution policy.\nWe were also instructed to call and leave on the front porch if no one was available. Which we did. Our standard policy is to call and if there is no response, and no one is home, we leave a message as to where the flowers are. Since we were instructed, by you, to leave them, they were; only after a phone call was made. Had you not told us to leave the arrangement, and weather was not good for our arrangement, we would have left a message detailing where the arrangement could be picked up.\nAlso, you did not order from a 3rd party person. You placed your order on our website, which is managed and updated by Teleflora. They are our wire service and website managing team. They have thousands of florists that they service and we all obviously have different items in stock. They do a generic picture, and when a picture is chosen we try to fill the order as best we can with the flowers we have on hand at that particular time. Flowers are very seasonal and have a high turnover because of spoilage. Next time, a  call directly to the florist could save you a substitution since you would know immediately what they had available at that time.\n\nAs far as using another florist, they would offer the same substitution policy as us, so I don't know that you would've been happier.\n\nSince you were happy with the flowers provided in the arrangement and they were Pretty and Fresh I can NOT offer you a 1/2 refund of the product, being as though you were please with it. I will however refund you the \"basket\" charge since you were not pleased with the substitution chosen. I will be adding a refund of the Full container charge of $2.50 to your card. I hope this helps.\nThank you for your business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4eb6ed4ce74d:0xf4773df3daae3fbb"}

My parents purchased a beautiful bouquet of red roses to be delivered to my office on campus after I passed my defense. In my previous review, I had been concerned about the black dots on the greenery of the bouquet and the lack of rose food provided. Sarah informed me that the black dots on the under side of the leaves are the reproductive spores of the plant. She clarified that you usually see them this time of year since this is their pollination season. I had been concerned about it being mold since I am allergic to mold and mildew and I immediately throw out anything that looks suspicious. (I have decided to leave the pictures here so that others can see that this is normal and is not mold, fungus, disease, etc.!) Sarah explained the reason that rose food is not provided is because their flowers are processed in a special solution in the shop so that the additional flower food is not needed. In addition, the roses live 5-7 days minimum. the flower solution is also in the water that is in the vase that the bouquet comes in.\n\nI want to emphasize the customer service.

My daughter called saying she was on her way out and I had to tell her to stay home because I knew they were on their way to make the delivery. The delivery person wanted to leave the flowers, balloons, and chocolates at the leasing office of my daughter's apartment which could be locked at any time. It is simple enough to call my daughter to be buzzed in at the gate. The delivery person also had to ask my daughter for her apartment number which I placed on the delivery address.

I selected flowers online and I also selected to have them delivered for a fee that I also paid for. I live in Georgia so I have never visited this business but from the reviews it seemed like a good place. Wrong! The day when my flowers were supposed to be delivered, the delivery driver called me so that I could give her directions to the address where they were supposed to be delivered. I told her that I did not live in that state and I was unfamiliar with how to get to the address. I then asked her if she had a GPS to use and she said that she did not. That was my first concern. My second concern was that she had already called my mom to tell her that she couldn't find the address and that she was delivering flowers. So that alone just ruined the whole point of having a special delivery. She totally ruined the moment. And then on top of it all she never found the address and my dad had to meet her somewhere to pick up the delivery himself. How terrible is that?!! A few days later I called to report the experience and the associate who listened to my complaint basically told me that I should not have a concern because they have voluntary delivery drivers who take the time out of their day to help them with the deliveries and not all of them have a GPS system. (Soooo...is it my problem that you don't provide your drivers with the equipment that they need to carry out the functions of their job?) So I then asked to speak with the manager who called me back the next day and she understood my concern and therefore credited my account for $40 (even though my purchase was over $65). So for Father's Day I decided to use my credit to have my father's flowers delivered to him for this holiday. When the flowers were delivered, my mom informed me (because my dad was embarrassed to tell me) that the vase that the flowers were in was so small that the flowers would not even stand up on their own. (Again another disaster!) I then called the business and told them of the situation and I spoke with an associate named Emily. Without getting my name or number or any type of information she told me that she vividly remembered the order and that the flowers were standing up perfectly fine when they left the business. She then spoke with her manager, Sarah (who was out of town), and her manager informed her that they would gladly go back and pick up my order and refund the amount if I was not satisfied. So rather than make the situation right by correcting their faulty product, they would rather just lose my business altogether, pick up my order and refund the purchase. (Some great customer service, right?) After Emily told me my options I was still confused as to how a delivery could be made without ensuring that the flowers were standing up. That seems kind of impossible. She then said, You only ordered three roses. What do you expect?!!\" (Sooo...it appears that your order has to be a certain size in order for quality to be present...\ud83d\udc40) Very frustrated I told her, \"I expect my flowers to stand up!\" She then hung up on me (or so she thought). I heard her then tell another associate that I raised my voice at her so that's why she hung up on me. So basically to sum it all up, my order was a disaster and when I called the business to try to get some kind of resolution the associate decides that hanging up on a paying customer was the best solution. Giving this business a one star rating is one star too many.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602e9bbd981bf:0x9beec865e4d849fc"}

Some of the small roses that were in the arrangement were broken when I picked it up. There was green floral tape around the top rim of the vase which could have been easily concealed with a nice ribbon. It was so much green foam in the bottom of the small sized vase. That may be why the flowers aren\u2019t lasting as they don\u2019t have enough room and are poorly cut and crammed in. We put the few flowers that we could salvage in a larger vase. It\u2019s unfortunate that I paid $66 dollars for an arrangement that my mother will only get to enjoy for a few days. I have Walmart flower bouquets that are outlasting these.

This time I was blown away by the EXCELLENT service I received!!! The manager MARK is the epitome of a great manager with EXCELLENT customer service.  I had an arrangement scheduled to be delivered this morning 2/2/2018 to a business for an individual, but the individual decided not to go to work that day to my dismay. However, Mark said \"No worries, we will send it out on Monday, don't let that upset you!\"  He is such a great example of what managers should be!! I will support his store from here forward!\n\nAugust 2016\nI placed an order online fairly early in the day and the delivery was not made until very close to the time the recipient was getting off for the day. I was told it would be delivered between 1-3pm and I get a call a 330p stating it was just out for delivery! I don't understand why there is only 1 driver. The next time I'll just go pick it up myself to avoid such a terribly long delay in delivery!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862132575d829c7:0x2cc57f2e8be23c56"}

After finally calling corporate I was told that the order would absolutely be ordered, likely by 9 PM (unacceptable in itself).\nAfter it still went unreceived and I filed a formal complaint on Saturday, I was informed that they would likely be open that day due to the holiday weekend and my order would *probably* be delivered that day. Again, my delivery went unreceived.\nSunday, I called the store all day, always reaching a busy tone, but felt confident that the company would at the very LEAST deliver my order first thing that morning, despite it already being two days late. No such luck.\nFINALLY today, three days after my intended delivery date, I was able to get ahold at someone at the store and let them know that I was displeased to say the least, and would like my order to still be delivered but would like the delivery fee refunded, as it did not arrive the day it should have. The person on the phone then said he cancelled my order completely (although I have yet to receive a refund), rang up another order, and charged my card AGAIN for the amount of the basket. By now, there has been $200+ worth of charges put on my card. But hey, they offered to give my mom a free box with 6 chocolate strawberries to make up for it.\nAfter speaking with my mother, we decided to cancel the entire order and, YET AGAIN after not being able to get ahold of anyone at the store for several hours, I called corporate and asked to cancel my order and was informed not only did they have absolutely no record whatsoever of my 2nd purchase (even thought they were more than happy to charge my card earlier today), MY ORIGINAL ORDER HAD BEEN CANCELLED BY SOMEONE ON THE DAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED. I was informed that I should try to get in contact with someone at the store (as if it's so easy) and my complaints would be passed on to the manager.

I ordered an arrangement and fruit basket instead of roses because both my wife and her mom have told me that they love fresh cut spring flowers.\n\nAfter lasts years disaster with Edible I was a bit worried when I came home from work and my wife said she had talked to her mom and that she had not mentioned anything special. We were instantly concerned that the bad experience with \"edible\" was being repeated.\n\nI called and Melissa said she was sure that mom's order was on the truck as she \"remembered the name.\" As I was hanging up my wife's phone rang and it was my mother-in-law calling to say that she had just been delivered the... - actual quotes - \"most beautiful flower arrangement ever\" and \"the biggest - and fresh fruit basket she had ever seen!\".

I met with Shannon and went over my colors and thoughts of what I was looking for. At the time I met with her, I was told to send her ideas anytime via cell phone and we had plenty of time to come up with the arrangements as the wedding was several months out.\n\nHowever, the service has not been what I expected as a paying client. I made a change and asked for an updated quote. It took me a week and a half to get the quote after I was told I would have it in two days and then had to request it multiple times. Again, still several months out from the wedding. I decided to make one more change and asked for an updated quote. Instead of being told that she wasn't in the office and she would get it to me, she tells me to add the additional charge to the existing quote which is should have ultimately been less. When I questioned this, I received this response, \"Honey, my store hasn't even opened. I'm not sitting in my office at the moment. I have no clue, I have a lot of weddings and you keep changing everything, so bear with me.\" Needless, to say as the paying client, I was extremely shocked. At this point, I decided to cancel her service. I then received this response, \"I'm sorry you took it the wrong way, that's a shame.\"\n\nI have been in customer service for many years and that is not the response you give a paying client. I would have completely understood had she told me that she wasn't in the office and she would have my updated quote by a given time.

I really just would have been fine if they were apologetic towards the situation and cared but instead in a monotone voice the response I was given was \"well sometimes we miss things, do you have the card so I can refund the money\". Outstanding response sir. Needless to say I told them my fianc\u00e9 would call them with the card information. When he called the owner answered and again was not very sympathetic to the situation. He decided a refund wouldn't matter since the surprise for her birthday was ruined anyways. She had the balloons delivered the next day that we paid for already and a box of 6 complementary strawberries sent with it.

I responded by telling her that florists do not call them \u201cblankets\u201d any longer, as that is an old term from the middle of the last century, when they used to sew  flowers onto a piece of heavy fabric and then draped it across the casket.

I wanted to make sure that she understood the difference so we were all on the same page. I was rather limited in what I had in stock and I told you what I could offer you.  You made the choice to see what else another shop could provide, to which I said I completely understood.\n\nI have learned that using correct terminology and making sure that everyone involved is thinking the same thing is in everyone\u2019s best interest.

I walked into this shop looking for some flowers and hoping for a delivery. I even offered to pay more than asking price for a delivery. The delivery really wasn't so much of a concern as it was getting an arrangement that I was happy with and would be meaningful for the person that I was sending them to.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in I was made very aware that they were about to close. Since I knew the flowers I wanted and they had them that made quick work of that portion. Being that I'm not a florist and I am a male I don't know all the things that make up a floral design, but I do know what looks pretty.  I was asked if I had a budget,  To which I replied not necessarily I just want something that looks pretty. The owner said how about a $100.00 and I said OK fine.\n\nWhile he was putting together the arrangement I asked if perhaps they gave any discounts to military service members to which he replied no. I continued to ask if they gave discounts to various other organizations that I belong to such as the Chamber of Commerce and others to which he replied in emphatically \"NO\". Now, at this point I was really just trying to make friendly conversation so I made a couple of friendly jokes about not having discounts, on which he became irate and said he was about to refund me my money and take back the arrangement.\n\nI just find it appalling that people can be so rude and have no sense of friendliness or humor whatsoever, especially in the time and day we live in where businesses are hurting to make money and I'm spending my hard earned money there.\n\nHe even went so far as to ask if I gave discounts in my business. I told him that in fact yes I do, all of the time. I wasn't really looking for a whole lot, 10% or something close to match an online competitors price which happened to be about $20 less. I don't know why it was unreasonable to ask for a small discount to show a little appreciation to any local organizations I belong to, much less for service to this country. I was appalled by his short and rude tone, especially after he told me he was the head of North Alabama BNI. You would think someone in this position would know how to run a business with not only some poise but also some friendly customer service. As long as I am a resident here I will never spend another dollar in this establishment and I'm not telling anyone not to do so, but I will say that if you spend money there, no appreciation is given for it and I might encourage you to find some other businesses that may appreciate it a little bit more.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4a33bc76c7:0x31492a699a9db552"}

A week prior Leigh suggested changing the color which I agreed to, but then the previous color was ordered. My husband spoke to them about it and Jerry was not the most friendly. My husband was told that their mistake almost cost us $500 and that he should tell me to stay off Pinterest. Then on our wedding day everything was set up promptly. The free tossing bouquet I should have received for signing a contract within two weeks of the initial consultation was not delivered. Luckily one of my bridesmaids couldn't take hers with her to Colorado. The vision came together mostly in the end. The flowers were gorgeous.

The reason it took 5 months to respond is because I was deployed serving my country. I don't have all the time to think about this type of stuff this is simply me telling my personal experience. Communication goes both ways especially in retail considering I came about a week early for it to be ready. On busy days like valentines day people have places to be.

I originally wanted painted roses, but they said they couldn't do it. They even offered some of their competition to help.  Well no one paints them around here.  Most were not very friendly want it either.  So I decided to give auburn flowers my business after all.  They were extremely polite even though they didn't offer the service i wanted.\nFast forward to the day of pick up. I had pre paid for my arrangement as a GameDay surprise for a special lady.  Well the night before she decided she didn't want to be so special lol.  I know it's what I get, for being a bama fan behind enemy lines lol.  So, I told them to just donate to the hospital.  I'm sure it would have made someone's day.\nAfter I week or so goes by and I'd completely forgot about the flowers and was forgetting about the special lady lol.  I noticed when I checked my bank that day.  They had sent me a refund for my order.  I can't stress this enough,  I DIDN'T ASK FOR ANY MONEY BACK.  So, long story short.  These guys do great arrangements and even better customer service.  They'll always have my business, even with auburn in the name!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605011762956, "text": "Thank you so much, John. Please let us know if we can help you again.

With the correct address lol.\n\n...The story continues...There's a lot of good people in this world.  THANK YOU Kirk & Trish for surprising my mom and delivering her flowers even though I messed up.  You both turned what could have been lemons into sweet lemonade and I sure do appreciate everything you both have done.   My mom is so happy!!!  And so am I.  You two are simply the best!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487367104349, "text": "Thank You, Kirk & Trish"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbc316a6207:0x40f9d398779924ce"}

I picked up one, then a other and then another peach only to find they were Green&Fuzzy...gave up on the peaches and showed them to the produce mgr who just shrugged his shoulders like he didnt care at all. So I went to buy a bag of tangerines. Guess what, when I picked up the bag all the ones on tbe bottom were Green & Fuzzy too. I went back to the mgr and he rolled his eyes and said \"what do you want? I check everyday...it happens\". That level of rot does Not happen over night and his attitude was the worse. Publix customers Pay More and I dont mind for better quality and service. After 14 yrs shopping at Publix for my Family of 4, I quit and found out that I get quality produce and other things at Piggly Wiggly for half the cost and great service. That's approx $600/month of my money Publix has lost. This particular Publix is not in as affluent an area as the one I used to shopping for 14 years but I would hate to think that the lack of $$ is why the products and service are inferior", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a1a338751df:0xeb1411e059ae0717"}

I ask the representative when was the soonest they could deliver the arrangement?  She told me they could deliver it around 12 Noon on Thursday, August 16, 2018.  I told her that would be great and to please get it there as close to Noon as possible.  She said they would.  I called Edible Arrangements at 12:30pm to see if my order had been delivered. The lady told me it was on the table being finished.  I told her it was supposed to be delivered at Noon and asked her when would it be delivered.  She told me by 2pm.  Bottom line, they did not get the arrangement delivered until 4:45pm and where they had to deliver it to was less than 3 miles from the Edible Arrangements shop.  I called and spoke to the manager and she didn't care at all about the problem and said there was no way they could have gotten it there by Noon.  I ordered it the day before. They open at 8am and you can't fix, arrange and deliver an arrangement by Noon and it is less than 3 miles from your place of business?  Something is wrong with your Business Plan then.  I called and complained to corporate  and they said they would have the owner call me from the Mobile, Alabama location but, I have not received a call yet.  I spent over $100.00 and the business delivered it when they wanted to not, when I wanted them to.  If I don't hear from the owner this week, I'm sending it to my attorney. I know it's just a $100.00 but, it's about the principle of the matter.  This business did not do what they said they would do and they have not even offered an apology, much less a refund.  Well, I expect a call and if I don't get one, it will most certainly cost them more than$100.00.  I don't want to have to do this but, it's time people are held accountable for their actions and it starts now for Edible Arrangements in Mobile,  Alabama.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d4074fa14bb:0x90ccbfe0582f1c5c"}

This was my first time using Hoover Florist though and while she was pleased to see flowers for her at work, once I showed her what she was SUPPOSED to receive, she was just as let down as I was.\nSubtle differences are to be expected, I understand that. Hers was night and day from the photo used to select her arrangement. Flowers sloppily grouped, colors grouped together instead of evenly distributed, not even the same type of greenery - the picture shows tiny and dainty leaves- hers looks like they came from Jurassic Park. The photo shows the flowers neatly run down towards the base of bowl shaped vase, matching the bowl shape and trimmed back as they get lower as to not stick out. The flowers look as though they mirror the shape of bowl - hers are all crammed in the top. I\u2019ve used other company\u2019s that put out nearly identical bouquets to their photo selections.\nWhen I called to let them know, I had no real intention of refunds or expectations but the woman defended the bouquet say the only difference was the flowers weren\u2019t as opened. I tried to explain that it looked sloppy, rushed and waaaaay too full of green filler plant. Still, defending their product, I was told my only option was for them to pick up the flowers and issue a refund....right...let me just snatch the flowers away from my wife in front of everyone at work, that\u2019s a viable solution. Thanks!!!\nI was honestly just hoping she would look at them and say \u201cyes, those are not what we would like to say are our best work\u201d bet she remained steadfast that it looked good. So...no Hoover Florist for me.\nSide note - I always send her $100 and up arrangements. More money means more time should be spent to make sure it\u2019s perfect for somebody\u2019s loved ones.\nOh I almost forgot - she continuously told me \u201cwe put in what the recipe calls for\u201d.....My 6 year old daughter can add in all the ingredients for a cake but she can\u2019t bake yet so it\u2019s just a bowl of ingredients until her mother or I put it in the oven and finish it...I was given a bowl of ingredients, not a finalized arrangement put together with care.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe0IQDoiCY-xgROpaUbdkzWN9hyQ6X7Ta6yoQB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a6b460073b:0xf0e737092811b24e"}

They also mislabel fish in the seafood market. I have seen them selling the lane snapper species labeled as the higher quality, better tasting and more expensive red snapper. This is a federal law violation so they might want to be careful what they call their fish.
