My wife and I are not the sharpest tech and TV couple around. We needed help. The clerk who took my call said she would get someone over quickly. Robert responded and listened  to our woes, then went to work and solved all our problems. He is knowledgeable and thorough in his work. His explanation was excellent and his instructions clear to us. He is a good listener. We now have excellent TV reception on all our sets. Thank you Robert and Securevision.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a069cfd579d0f:0xaa3a55b31122d82c"}
