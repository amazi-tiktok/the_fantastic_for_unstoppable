Took my car to this shop to get the catalytic converter replaced and he ran a compression test on the engine instead, which I did not authorize. I would never suggest a place that does not get authorizations on work preformed. What I did authorize was it to be put on a lift and the exhaust removed. Putting a compression test was a waste of my time and money as well as not a test one would use for a blown CAT, save yourself the headache and go to a more reputable muffler shop. I think maybe the owner and the workers would do some good to read exhaust systems for dummies so they don't make the same mistakes in the future. With that being said, do you really want someone working on your vehicle that doesn't understand basic troubleshooting and how to properly run diagnostics. Either way after he tells me my engine is trash (I'm interested as to how that happened in his hands) he offered to buy my vehicle, can we say shady. The most interesting part is all the assumptions without proper diagnosis. When I questioned the compression test, I never authorized, Travis the owner hung up on me, not sure why he felt the necessity to charge someone for something he couldn't even explain the necessity for. Honestly, this is not a good place as there are certified, reputable muffler shops in the surrounding areas, use those other places so you don't have the same horrible thing happen to your vehicle with no explanation. Buyer beware of shady tactics and unexperienced mechanics.\n**I want to note that I'm pretty sure all the 5 star reviews are from his friends and family.

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

With the late open and the trashy appearance I should have left as these are signs of poor management.

When I heard back from them they said it was done and we agreed I would pick up the following morning, when I arrived they indicated half of the things I asked to be done weren't done and they can not do them (rear dif & and tire service). I was not charged for the items but now I need to make another service appointment elsewhere.\n\nSeparately, one of the Technicians blocked my wife and kids in while they were dropping me off.

Learned I needed the outer tie rod ends done, among a couple of other things. So I shopped around for cheaper prices and came across Midas in Hoover, AL. Took my vehicle to have the radiator and outer tie rod ends replaced/repaired and an alignment done on January 29, 2015. A week ago or so I noticed something was off with the ride of my vehicle. It would pull and had a slipping feel when turning and braking and just driving in general. It worsened and I felt I shouldn\u2019t be driving it. I started thinking I needed to take it back to Midas because something wasn\u2019t right with the steering and suspension (which they\u2019d \u201crepaired\u201d). On February 23, 2015, I cranked the car up to leave work and the steering wheel loosened and turned far right on its own. Called AAA to have my baby towed. The AAA guy instantly diagnosed it and said the tie rod wasn\u2019t done right. The pin wasn\u2019t inserted in the tie rod end. We found the bolt that came off in the parking lot.\n\nAll three AAA guys diagnosed the problem and confirmed about Midas improperly installing the outer tie rod ends. One even said that could be a lawsuit and Midas would eat the cost. Had I drove home, that could have been my life on the road. My baby was towed home on a flatbed and then towed straight to Midas the next morning on February 24, 2015. I was not confident in Midas working on my CRV again. Especially since they didn\u2019t do the job right the first time and it had to be done again. And on top of that, the same technician from the first time ended up working on my car this time around. They apologized and claimed the part was defective. I seriously doubt that. This was completely their fault. Point blank.\n\nAnd to top it all off, that same technician (initials TT, according to my invoice, I believe) that worked on my car both times and drove it out afterwards, stole $20 from my ashtray compartment. He reached down and picked something up off the floor and got out of my car while putting something in his pocket. We caught it before leaving and went back to confront the guy, a short white male that looked to be in his 30s maybe; thick southern drawl. They compensated my stolen possession\u2026with the exact money he stole from my vehicle -- minutes before. We made a little scene about it. It\u2019s the principle of the matter. I usually take my stuff out of my car when having it worked on or having it in the care of someone else. But I failed to completely take all my significant possessions out\u2026like my frikin\u2019 gas money left in the ashtray. Another technician informed us that that wasn\u2019t the first time something like that happened around there and that \u2018we didn\u2019t hear that from him\u2019.\n\nSo not only does Midas not properly repair parts on a car, they also search it and steal possessions. I\u2019m not confident in the repairing of their wrongdoing. I\u2019m wondering if something else might go wrong. Their credibility is shot with me. I actually feel I should be refunded the cost for labor, if not the whole amount. And since it was a \"defective part,\" they should refund me the cost for parts since the problem had to be fixed (and hopefully it actually is, this time and nothing else goes wrong from them working on it). I will be going to the home office about this. I will reach out to corporate about this. I will review the hell out of this Midas location. A situation like mine was potentially life-threatening and a definite lawsuit waiting to happen.

I had one already that was done poorly by a previous shop, and I wanted something better, something that sounded better, and something that looked better.  Me and the owner spoke the same language when it came to how he would go about making they system, and when all was said and done, the work truly exceeded my expectations.  The new sound has made me fall in love with my car all over again.  The shop is awesome and clean, the owner is very friendly and will do whatever it takes to satisfy your exhaust needs, and the prices are reasonable for the quality of work.

I have always had trust issues when it comes to letting people touch or work on my car. I love to detail it on a professional level and want everything on it to be perfect.\n\nShawn has gone above and beyond all my expectations. Not only could he fit my car in for a new exhaust system in that week, he also managed to get it done on the same day! Don't let the outside of the shop fool you. It may be a little dusty here and there, but that is the result of all the beautiful hard work that is put into the exhaust systems. The same day turn around for such amazing work is what still blows my mind!\n\nMy exhaust was done at another shop before, and for their sake I won't be mentioning their name. It was a disaster what they did. Not only was it done poorly, it didn't even last a full 3 years.\n\nShawn came to the rescue and fixed all their errors. With his work I received:\n- Someone who listened to exact customer demands.\n- A full explanation of what he was going to do.\n- A quote to which he was really close when done. (Some places end up way over original quotes)\n- Brand new exhaust brackets that prevent the exhaust from moving or rattling.\n- Picture perfect welds that are painted over to blend in and prevent corrosion.\n- An exhaust system that is level at every point (Yes, he proved it with a leveler)\n- Flat black painted pipes to blend in with the underbody of my car where they are normally exposed.\n- Weld points on the exhaust tips, on top of the factory bolts, to really secure them and keep them perfectly aligned.\n\nFor all that, the price he quoted me is by far more than reasonable. In fact, I feel like I owe him more for the immaculate level of craftsmanship he performed on my car. Definitely the place to go in Birmingham, AL.

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop. I wonder if this is the intent of the Meineke representative who gave this card to my son's mother?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622217384048, "text": "Hi Tom, this should never be the impression we leave.

They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr.

I travel with my job and always would stop at this location when I needed an oil change, battery, wiper blades and much much more.  The last time I was there the technician scared me in to spending over $800 in repairs that have never  been an issue before on a car that I bought new couple years ago.  I thought I would try them again, I just called for a quote on breaks, I explained all I needed was break shoes, and would like a  quote.  The man I was talking to told me to bring it in.  Again I said I just need a quote, he told me he could not give me a quote with out bringing it in for inspection.  I will never use Meineke again, that is how they lure you in, you take your car/truck there for something and before you leave they scare you to death saying something else is life or death.  I just wanted a quote on brakes..... Needless to say Budget Brakes (2 doors down from Meineke) was glad to give me a quote and has now put the breaks on my Nissan Altima.
