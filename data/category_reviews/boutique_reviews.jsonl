They have a beautiful high quality selection. We worked with Stephanie and she was so sweet patient and professional.  We purchased a new setting for my engagement ring solitaire while we were vacationing there and my solitaire fell out(after 10 years). They helped me select the perfect ring. We put it in layaway as our 10th anniversary was in December(this happened in June). I forgot to snap a picture of it while we were there so I called Stephanie and she happily got it out of the safe and put it on her own finger and sent me pictures via text message. She went above and beyond! We were shopping with our kids and they offered them chocolates and water. We called to have my diamond placed in the new ring on Wednesday of this week and they placed it on the same day we called and overnighted the ring to me for free. I live 6 hours from Gulf Shores. It was at my door the next morning. It is so beautiful! I am so thankful we went there to see about getting my original ring repaired and ended up with a gorgeous new ring that has special meaning since it was purchased at one of my favorite vacation spots.

My daughter has never been \"prom dress shopping\", so this was a special event for her. We drove 2+ hours to Elan, and we were greeted as we entered the store. Everything else from that point was terrible. My daughter tried on several gowns and the salesgirl held the train on each dress as I took a photo of my daughter in it - never one time did she ever ask us not to take photos of the gowns. After my daughter had tried on about 4-5 dresses, one of the other salesgirls commented \"we don't really like for y'all to take photos of the tags\", to which I said I was sorry and we stopped taking photos of the tags on the gowns. I was unsure why, but I assume it is because their gowns are marked up well over retail. After my daughter tried on 1-2 more gowns, an older lady walked over to us and very rudely yelled at my daughter if she was taking pictures she would have to delete all of them before leaving the store. She also said \"I know two of my girls have already told you to stop taking pictures\". This is untrue, as the only person who had previously said anything was the salesgirl (not ours) that said not to take photos of the tags. I could see my daughter was very visibly upset, so we said thank you and left the store. They lost my business forever, as well as everyone I know that I can tell about our experience. My daughter commented when we left that she never wants to go prom dress shopping ever again, so I am really upset that these incredibly rude girls have ruined this experience for my daughter.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1614050666769, "text": "This customer was not treated anything but wonderful in our store. She was greeted upon arrival and employees spent hours catering to her every need.  If mistreated the entire time no one would spend 2 hours in a store. Upon entry into our store on the front door and posted at every dressing room are NO photography signs. That is our store policy due to customers like this one.  Once a gown is purchased you are more than welcome to take all the photos you would like. This specific customers after being asked twice not to take photos continued to take pictures of Gown tags and photos of gowns. If you plan to purchase a gown in our store there would be no need to take photos of our tags. All of our gowns are priced the same as any other retailer so you will not find it cheaper unless it is a used product. After being asked repeatedly to not take photos and the customer blatantly in front of employees & other customers continuing to not follow store policy she was asked very politely by the store manager to please delete any photos taken in our store as it is against store policy. No one ever raised their voice at this customer nor were they mistreated in any way.  They were kindly asked to follow the store policy like every other customer. This customer then left our store after taking up hours of employees\u2019 time, trying on our product, finding her correct size and went on resale sites posting exactly what size she needed and photos of herself in our merchandise in our store trying to find it at a used price.

I guessed she noticed my face when she did that and asked if that was ok. I said it was just never had someone take my purse out from me like that. She asked if I knew what I wanted to do with my hair. I told her I hadn't gone in 5 years and wanted to talk about what would be best health wise to do w my hair w color.she said \"you didn't bring a picture? Or anything? Usually when I sit in a stylists chair I already know what I want to do.\" I said well I thought I could discuss it. I ended up saying blonde highlights. (I probably had an attitude at this point Bc of how she had been toward me.) she hair dried my hair roughly. Then left without saying a word for a couple minutes. Came back and tried ripping off the cape she had on me saying he wasn't doing my hair today. She want use to rude customers... I said she came off very ...she cut me off and said that she was done. I said she was the rude one and went to the receptionist by the door and told them what had happened and one women.(looked like the manager or whatever.) said sometimes ppl don't mesh well but that there were plenty of other salons I could go to. I said \"no sorry?\" ... I told her and the gossipy women around her that I was going to be writing reviews and I left...... Now I have worked in customer service for multiple years and have never been allowed to treat a customer (rude or difficult) in such a manner.

You may not know this but many tanning lotions you find on the internet at a price point that is much lower than we, as a professional tanning salon, can purchase it from our distributors are expired, discontinued or come from china. I apologize that we where unable to make you happy with your lotion purchase and that your felt the need to leave us a 1* review. The lotion you looked up on Amazon takes 3-6 weeks to arrive, that means it is in fact coming from china. Perhaps the tanning salon you are currently tanning at can price-match with Amazon.

She also told me I needed a cut & deep conditioning treatment but didn't have time to do so because they were closing, then told me it'd be $95 so I had to send someone to an atm at a gas station because they don't take credit cards and then right when they get there to the shop she said \"it's $130\" and they had to go back to the atm!! I believe her name was Ashley not 100% for sure though. I had to pay $280 for color correcting and getting the red she streaked all over my hair was near impossible it was even underneath on the bottom with 3 perfect chunky streaks going up to the top of my head. Then my color corrector called them to ask what dyes they put on my hair to see how she was going to strip it out and with what she'd use to do so to do the least damage and the salon told her I've never been to this salon!!! I've been at least 8 times in 2 years. She told me the salon business is a shady one when other salons call & that they usually know if another is calling its for color correcting purposes.

I think I deserve to have what I asked the clerk for.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e8689f23c902d:0x857b246eacd075cc"}

Then the phone rings and she says \"Hold on a minute.\" and answers it. I have no problem with that. What bothered me was the fact that she proceeded to spend 8 plus minutes describing and finding the item(s) for the caller instead of asking them to hold on and pointing me in the right direction. I wear an extra large so I browsed for a bit, not seeing anything beyond a large. Perhaps they don't carry my size, but, again, she should have put the call on hold and told me so. She then takes the callers item(s) behind the counter and I think, \"she is finally going to assist me\". NOPE. She starts taking the callers payment info. WOW. This is the rudest I have ever been treated so I walked out. I'm happy to say that the next place I went to was happy to help me and I bought two outfits I thought were much better looking than anything I saw in this shop.

I was going to the grocery store earlier today, and I said if she didn't make that then she had somebody make it. If she has an eye for that skillful, artistry talent, then I need to go see what exactly is in the store. I was not disappointed. Ashli (I hope I'm spelling that right.) Is currently the manager and she was more than happy to tell me about the store and about the different unique items they have in the boutique. As you can see from the pictures, there's a wide variety of items that women or the women in your life will definitely love to have. If you're in the Trussville area and looking for a gift for that special woman in your life, then I strongly advise you to come down and see Ashli at the Tula J Boutique conveniently located in downtown Trussville on highway 11.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbca3pOAzA8d1f0WmimowdUTjDI93Xm4p9Kwyw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn_JC6Ae8T677x7XbORe-ijLowZo-4lWNmRS4u=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzT-q3ZqbbNch_xVqmv_FtpegmYgP8uaMhmoJV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnD1YvCQS9TS8OHFtlrZxO8MfTemkp_Edt3yfI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF_mjcGwkWUhx75jp4CWzMqkJwyr32KE--wg-N=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtOPwncrn6_37nEte-quFWch8kBpUGydk1iEQz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw6Vo2RatWQbN0kwXaktLclOG8e6_y5M4znPDI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGSIZ9cYMItgXb6VlfjcyOQ3F9mUpj10jLQg-s=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPe-fjqK8J3GUPITvhllyx8axWNaH6KxlTvE0mS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_CdrlHARabk8sLf8rkyIeZwFwGXdVM5hpUUPa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQ_ODIzUQjXJrwMOqBln06W2eyccUO_H3_em2-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKStbPJroRmDXtXm0UQrjPEx0RKJ6GUPLH3G5Y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODYb69bntNd1KOfyahoHeAX3ICXKTmTX-gGo8f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIgPkB6gbokmzSPB-0cGOqnw6VqvwU4F54PQkx=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgAf3LWixMpzRU3yFlRd6s_ynzJYUZxBk786VO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_Yrt2U1eXc0Maz_-DI7R5BlpvWMecAXeXiVqc=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyBaG3rT5xy2dvHDzNWU3tlxjZPJYOHhX5vy0h=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890ce3c082c6fd:0x87e6e66215c1c48f"}

And then they justified not helping me out because I had a few  \u201ctiny\u201d terra-cotta pots and two plants (which were actually 12-18\u201d pots). They paid more attention to my kids than to me, the paying customer.

However...the Jones Valley stop CSR's had been polite & answered questions...but wouldn't help gather my large quantity of items. I had to gather, lift, & carry them.\nFollowing Spine & Hip injections, this was strain to my back & painful. Afterwards, I struggled walking. The associate permitted me to use their plastic cart. After leaving, I was complaining to myself, as I crossed the street to my car. A lady, carrying Bath & Body bag, crossed as well. I commented about the associates at the store being lazy.\nAs that person went on. I loaded my things & was leaving the cart on the grass.  The lady in the parking area yelled & demanded I return the cart. I didn't fully understand. So, I asked again what she said. She made her demand on me about 3 times.\nI asked her if she worked there? She said yes.  I asked if she was a Manager? She said Yes!\nI tried to tell her about the laziness I was dealing with.\nShe became irritated with me. No peaceful problem solving was enacted.\nShe came hurriedly at me. I asked her to stop. I warned her, she was crossing the line.  She came anyways, within inches of me, calling me lazy, grabbed my cart without my permission, & proceeded to the store, being loud, calling me lazy repeatedly, & told me to never step foot in her store again!\nShe definitely broke the Covid rules, & came to close to me besides, causes me to feel uncomfortable.\nI requested the 911 service & filed a report.\nThe Manager, should have been more professional.  She ordered me to never come back & she don't have to worry.  I don't want to!!!\nAll I can say is remember when shopping at the Jones Valley location, to take help for you, because they are not much help.  And watch out for the Quick Tempered Manager.\nIt's 4 AM & my Spine & hip still hurt.

The paper work that you signed at the beginning of your service, explains that if you are unsatisfied with your hair, your stylist will be more than happy to come up with an arrangement to get your hair where you would like it to be. We truly wish you would have come to us first so we could evaluate your hair and make it right for you without the additional costs of another salon. We have offered for you to come in and have us take a look at your hair to evaluate the situation, and we are sorry that you did not want to come in to work this out. Unfortunately, due to the time your stylist spent with you, product used, and not having the opportunity to evaluate your hair in person, we are unable to refund you for this service. Upon reviewing your paper work, your stylist noted that your hair would need more than one service to achieve the end results that you were wanting. This is due to the fact that your hair was already previously lightened at home before your visit to us. We are always striving for what's best for our clients. In this circumstance, your hair wouldn't be able to handle any further lightening in one visit. It is our understanding that in order to protect the integrity of your hair, you and your stylist decided to go with a darker blonde until your next service. We aren't quite sure what happened between the time you left the salon and now, but after your service you told us that you loved your hair and even booked your future reservation with us. We deeply value you as a customer of ours and we are sorry to see you go. We appreciate your review and we hope you have a wonderful day."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a61f96ea20655:0x14238b725edd250"}

This was my first time using Hoover Florist though and while she was pleased to see flowers for her at work, once I showed her what she was SUPPOSED to receive, she was just as let down as I was.\nSubtle differences are to be expected, I understand that. Hers was night and day from the photo used to select her arrangement. Flowers sloppily grouped, colors grouped together instead of evenly distributed, not even the same type of greenery - the picture shows tiny and dainty leaves- hers looks like they came from Jurassic Park. The photo shows the flowers neatly run down towards the base of bowl shaped vase, matching the bowl shape and trimmed back as they get lower as to not stick out. The flowers look as though they mirror the shape of bowl - hers are all crammed in the top. I\u2019ve used other company\u2019s that put out nearly identical bouquets to their photo selections.\nWhen I called to let them know, I had no real intention of refunds or expectations but the woman defended the bouquet say the only difference was the flowers weren\u2019t as opened. I tried to explain that it looked sloppy, rushed and waaaaay too full of green filler plant. Still, defending their product, I was told my only option was for them to pick up the flowers and issue a refund....right...let me just snatch the flowers away from my wife in front of everyone at work, that\u2019s a viable solution. Thanks!!!\nI was honestly just hoping she would look at them and say \u201cyes, those are not what we would like to say are our best work\u201d bet she remained steadfast that it looked good. So...no Hoover Florist for me.\nSide note - I always send her $100 and up arrangements. More money means more time should be spent to make sure it\u2019s perfect for somebody\u2019s loved ones.\nOh I almost forgot - she continuously told me \u201cwe put in what the recipe calls for\u201d.....My 6 year old daughter can add in all the ingredients for a cake but she can\u2019t bake yet so it\u2019s just a bowl of ingredients until her mother or I put it in the oven and finish it...I was given a bowl of ingredients, not a finalized arrangement put together with care.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe0IQDoiCY-xgROpaUbdkzWN9hyQ6X7Ta6yoQB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a6b460073b:0xf0e737092811b24e"}

No big deal, you run that risk when you order online.

After explaining that I probably would not be ordering from their site again, and I wanted a refund instead of a store credit. They issued a code. About a week after I sent the dress back, I received an email today saying that my return had been processed and attached was my gift card code. So I went ahead and tried to call their customer service team to try to get the refund they told me I'd get. I waited on hold for another 15 minutes before I gave up and called their store in Auburn. I asked if the associate at the store could try to transfer me over to customer service, because I wasn't getting through. She tried three separate times, and eventually came on the line suggesting that CS had left early from the office. I called at 4:07 and they were supposed to be there until 4:30. Ultimately, the customer service team has been a nightmare to deal with, and since I had to pay for shipping both ways, I've lost money from ordering with them.
