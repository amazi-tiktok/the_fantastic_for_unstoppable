Side note: they don't just focus on skin-- they also made amazing recommendations for me in regard to my chronic migraines! I have been so discouraged after trying countless \"solutions\", programs, and even visiting other doctors/experts that have literally said \"there's really not much else you can do for hormonal acne.\" Dr. Seiler and Leigh Ann have so much great knowledge, and I was so comforted and encouraged to hear their recommendations and plan of treatment. In fact, I almost burst into tears when Dr. Seiler said, \"We are going to get this handled for you.\"\nAfter ONE WEEK of being on the new skincare regimen they suggested for me (which, by the way, is incredibly simple and takes about 1-2 minutes), my skin was noticeably clearer (insane, right?!). I am still in shock by how much my skin has improved in such a short amount of time. For the first time in forever, I am much more confident in my skin and can actually go without concealer if I want to! Also, Leigh Ann is SO fun and easy to talk to, and I always look forward to my appointments with her. Being a graduate college student, finances are somewhat tight. However, they have an amazing VIP program full of so many discounts and perks (never seen anything like it before), and they also understood where I was coming from and provided cost-effective options. If you're on the fence about making an appointment with them, know that IT IS WORTH IT. I could go on and on about how much I love this place, and I want everyone to experience what I have with them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626372419443, "text": "Jordan, this is absolutely amazing!

During this time, they did not have a time available for me to come in despite the reaction continuously spreading. Once I finally received a call back they felt no need for me to come in despite my concern. The solution was to put some cortizone you can get at any drug store.

The rash like breakout was extremely concerning and it is troubling they would not be concerned with a breakout they caused.

We would have been more than happy to extend your time off with a work excuse...not a problem at all.  If you experience post procedure discomfort, you are welcome to try heat or ice to the area that is bothering you.  Yes, this would be difficult while at work, this is intended to be done while resting at home.  Compression hose is to be worn for 2 weeks following the ablation procedure.  We want you to resume walking and regular day to day activities within the next day or two at the latest while wearing the compression hose, just not strenuous exercise or running for 2 weeks.  This will aid in your recovery and prevent post procedure swelling plus minimize the risk even further for blood clots.  We don't want you to sit around not moving for 2 weeks, that will only prolong the recovery process.   Compression hose is covered by only 1 of the 50+ insurance companies that we accept....and only on a case by case basis with that one carrier....after we submit your medical records for review by the insurance investigator.

We charge the patient for the compression hose up front, if insurance happens to reimburse us for the hose, we will refund the purchase price to the patient immediately.  Unfortunately, this happens only 3-4 times a year.  Some patients attempt to recover the charge on their own by submitting the charge....they are sometimes successful, however, it is only with the one insurance company.  I promise you will receive a reimbursement for the hose if we receive a reimbursement from the insurance company.  Again, I'm terribly sorry you are disappointed.....we would be delighted to meet with you in the office to discuss your concerns.  I appreciate you taking the time to review us....we strive to be a dedicated center of excellence.  Reviews help us improve our patient care and office policy. If we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at 205.823.0151 or to me directly at the info below.  Have a great day.\n\nZeke Eldridge\nPractice Administrator\nzeke@alabamaveincenter.com\ndirect: 205.716.6050"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889191cc43fbc3d:0xd4bfca5804e058ad"}

She said a manager would get back with me today, but no one ever contacted me.

I notified the receptionist who put a note in the system. I thought maybe I had a one time bad experience, since the rash seemed to go away, so I went back the following month. I got another rash but this time it spread up and down my arms. My doctor told me it looked like a fungal infection but to be safe she would refer me to a dermatologist. I got a doctors note stating I needed to refrain from massages until the dermatologist could determine what the rash was and if it was safe to go back. I took my doctors note and filled out a membership cancellation form. I noticed my monthly fee was withdrawn after I had submitted the form so I called. I was told my cancellation was denied because I needed a note from the dermatologist. I can\u2019t get a dermatologist note for another month when I have my appointment but even so, why is my doctors note not enough? According to their cancellation policy a note from a doctor stating one cannot be massaged for medical reasons should suffice. The manager didn\u2019t even have the decency to call me! I only found out because I called them. I am out $130 and still have one more month before my contract is up. Not to mention the doctor bills. Do not go here!

So I purchased a very expensive perfect package for my girl as a surprise Valentine's day present at this location bc ive sent her here once before and she seemed to enjoy it. Well the lady at the desk inquired on who it was for and apparently submitted the information under her name where as MY email confirmation went directly to my girl, where she called me informing me she knew my plans for her, spoiling the surprise!!! That should have never happened! I then called and explained my irritation and informed them I was coming for a refund. They called me back like it was no biggy like cool we can just refund this over the phone for you rather than saying hey i'm sorry is there any way we can make this right for you! I'm a funny, chill laid back dude, but if you ruin a surprise, that is my one and only immediate heartbreak bc that ruins the joy of spending lots of money to be able to see the expression on your womans face of how happy she is. Presents are for the givers and for the receivers bc we both enjoy feeling the happiness of THE SURPRISE!! Please resolve this issue, bc i'm a man of morality bc now my woman is upset with me bc I refunded the package but I simply can NOT do business with folks that aren't in it for the satisfaction of those spending their hard earned money! So now, I had Valentine's all planned out perfect to the T, I no longer have the \"kaboom\" gift available, and now there is all this negative energy between me and my woman bc I know she still wants the package but I can not allow it bc the surprise was so important to me i absolutely had to have my money back so that this place would know and preferably remember that they ruined something for two special people! I wouldn't dare ask for something free, I would feel bad for taking anything not earned, but as a man that runs  a business, I make free offers every day to ensure customer satisfaction and that they come back!!

If you could let me know when it was that you had your visit with us and anything we can do to have made your experience more welcoming and relaxing?  We always appreciate when people take the time to let us know how we are doing. In some cases they do get us mixed up with a Serenity near us that we are not affiliated with. I want to check and see if our reviews are coming from our clients. So I double checked the system so that I'm not reach out to you personally but can't seem to find your information.

It was so soothing and calmed my face down as I sat in my car before leaving! She told me if I didn\u2019t get a result from that, bring the other two products back and get my money back! When she said that, I knew she was genuinely trying to help me, and she did! My face has never felt as good as it feels, and looks from using these particular products!

But the nurse who welcomed me in apologized for that and said it\u2019s not normal. Then I had a little incident with my baby who was with me and everyone was so kind and understanding and helpful! And then the main reason I was there was for my acne and the doctor prescribed me things that were safe while breastfeeding. She explained what was going on, too. I\u2019m about 2 weeks in with her suggestions and my skin has significantly improved. I will definitely continue to come here for my skin health needs.\n\nUpdate: I have been to this location 3 times now and each time I have had an hour + wait. So the first time was not an isolated experience. Today is July 13th, 2020. Jefferson county has put a message out saying masks are required to help stop the spread until there is a vaccine. Unfortunately, this location is subject to this \u201crequirement\u201d and after asking if I had to even with the recent announcement that the WHO has come out and said in a press conference that \u201cit is rare for an asymptomatic person to spread COVID. \u201c So now we are in an era where counties and the businesses in them will pander to fear that is unfounded as of today with the death rate of Covid well below 1%. We will see what the future holds for Covid. If it mutates into a more dangerous strand, I will re-assess my frustration with businesses like this. But in the mean time, I will speak my mind and spread truth about what Covid is. I\u2019m sick and tired of being forced to wear a mask that will spike my carbon dioxide intake that has been proven to lower my immune system along with many other side effects. And all in the name of waiting for a vaccine that will still not have a long term trial study under its belt to make sure that there are not any severe long term side effects. And in case you are not aware, there are plenty of vaccines that have side effects that do not show up right away. One example of this is thimerosal (Mercury) was removed or reduced from vaccine use. Heck, Johnson and Johnson just settled with plaintiffs who experienced many different cancers decades after the use of JJ baby powder. BABY POWDER!! So I have serious concern with an inoculation that will most likely be required, like the masks are, to \u201cstop the spread\u201d (of a disease that is recording low death rates) that will not have long term testing to make sure that we aren\u2019t doing more harm than good. But that\u2019s my two cents.  I will most likely end up moving my derm needs to an office that not only can figure out how to not have hour waits for their patients but is brave enough to look the stats and facts in the face and take a stand against the current overstep we are seeing all over the country.\n\nAll in all, the people here are very kind, and the doctor I\u2019ve been seeing seriously helped with my adult acne. So  I will give them 4 stars. I recongize it\u2019s hard to stand against the grain. But the hour plus waits have been very hard since I bring my infant with me to these appointments.\n\nLastly, they also require hand sanitizer and temp check. These are things that do not bother me personally, and I still complied with all that was asked of me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aacce729c9:0x135bb203d88babc6"}

It was my first appointment with Cahaba Dermatology the day I went it must have been a busy day for them, I waited that day about 45 min and people\nwere getting called into see her while I was still sitting out in the waiting room it ended up being me & one other lady that day which she was there before I was , I finally got called in and left her sitting there.\nI met Dr. Groysman and we proceeded with my appointment she biopsied a place on my ear I was having problems with.  My results came back and everything was okay. I still have problems\nwith my ear from time to time was the reason I made the 2nd appointment \u2013 fast forward to May 2018 and I called and made an appointment with her Nurse Practitioner& was told when I called in that I had a balance from 2016 that would have to be paid \u2013 Im not sure about their billing department but I didn\u2019t know about the balance & I told her that I would pay it. If I had known about a past due  and call to make an appointment is that someone that is trying not to pay? So we made the appointment went in today 6/7 my appointment was at 11:00 I get to my appointment she collects my co-pay I go sit down and she calls me back to the front desk and proceeds to tell me that she collected the co-pay not realizing there was the balance due and I would need to pay or I\ncouldnt go thru with my  appointment. I told her I couldn\u2019t pay it all today \u2013 that I could pay it tomorrow and she said she would have to speak with someone in billing \u2013 so this other young lady  comes out and says basically the same thing the other one  did with the exception -she said that someone had called me and left a voice mail for me & did I not get the voice mail? & on that VW stated I had to pay this. Which I said no  & I told her the same thing  - I get paid tomorrow and I would pay it then -  she says I couldn\u2019t keep the appointment if I didn\u2019t pay today. So I had to leave.   This review is not about whether I got to keep my appointment or not, its not about the balance I owe, its about how people are treated, all this was handled out at the front desk instead of asking me to step to the side, step into the 2nd  young ladies office , or go stand out front and wait for the police to arrive to hand cuff me is the way I felt  Just as the 1st appointment  was not good , my 2nd time there was even worse. I was so humiliated that other people could hear what was going on. I owe the money - but I would rather other people not know that I owe that money. I wish I would have paid more attention to the girls names, but I do remember faces. I had not intentions of not paying the balance due.\n\nMy cousin goes to Dr. Groysman - he has all great things to say about her as a Doctor & as a person. He thinks very highly of her & her practice. He is the reason I made the 2nd appointment -he said I should try again.\nMy cousin's name is Don Amick. He was also surprised that I couldn't keep my appointment today. BTW they took my co-pay and took it off my past due amount. My balance was 125.00 and not I only owe 95.00. That's right 95.00 not 200.00, not 300.00, not 500.00. It was 125.00. I've never written a review, while I know this is a long review - I just couldn't let this go.

I felt like my daughter was a Guinie pig! So the last resort was Accutane and after a week my daughter could not move or get out of bed that's how poisonous it was. We stopped it immediately and I took her to another Dr who diagnosed her w policystic ovaries... all she needed was a simple blood test. her face is a lot better now. I don't know how much harm all the meds she took for months did to her body. I'm just furious that nobody even suggested a blood test, they just treated the face, not the whole body. Hope our bad experience will help someone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aacce729c9:0x135bb203d88babc6"}

I receive a call saying someone had spelled the name wrong  and I can come back to use my certificate. At this time I'm frustrated. I requested a refund and was told I couldn't receive one when they made the mistake. Me and my boyfriend spent time and gas trying resolve the issue when I think they could have resolved it better and in a timely matter.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a7b758ed9419:0x25e1468703c88f53"}

You fill out a form beforehand stating where you'd like them to focus on and where you don't want to be touched. The only negative part of my experience is that the three places I specifically wrote I didn't want to be touched, my massage therapist touched. I didn't exactly feel comfortable telling her during my massage cuz I wrote it down on the form which I had handed to her. It made parts of my massage tense for me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a7b758ed9419:0x25e1468703c88f53"}
