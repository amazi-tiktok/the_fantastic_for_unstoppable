Then suggests I lie (red flag 3) to marvins and don\u2019t tell them that I dropped my brand new saw 20 feet to the ground resulting in its current running condition..\nNow, being a traveling master tech myself I am on an extreme time crunch. I hand the saw to him and tell him to fix it.\n3 days later, he called me telling me it\u2019s fixed. \u201cCool, what was it?\u201d I asked him. He said that the fuel line in the tank was torn, so he replaced it. He states that he also replaced the fuel filter, the spark plug, and cleaned the carburetor (red flag 4-7).\nKeep in mind folks that this saw had maybe 10 minutes run time on it before I dropped it.\n\u201cHuh, weird. I\u2019ll be by Saturday to pick it up\u201d.\nSaturday rolls around, I hand him a crisp $100 bill and get my saw back reassured again that it is fixed.\n-I get back to my house, try to fire the saw, it fires but runs like garbage for about 5 seconds then dies. Won\u2019t start again. I then hop onto google and read some reviews on this place. No way am I going to bother calling him or bring it back.\nA month later, I finally have a day off and time to diagnose my saw. Ignition coil was cracked and it was grounding itself out losing spark. It also had a small intake leak I assume was from him taking the saw apart, and I adjusted my carb a bit. I am not convinced any parts listed above were even changed..\nMy saw now runs great; because I am the first kind of technician I described above. This guy is the second kind.

I could have gotten a MUCH better deal from another dealer but I didn't want to drive over an hour if I needed parts. For this reason I was willing to overlook the salesman who had ZERO knowledge of tractors, had no idea what a flail mower was and couldn't tell me what features would justify the expense of one implement over the other. I was willing to ignore  the random mechanic who wandered onto the sales floor trying to talk me out of the machine I wanted even though he had no understanding of my needs. I also endured the pain of dealing with the rude and unwelcoming finance manager who had the personality of a shoe. All of this because of the promise of a good service department and the full coverage warranty through Kubota and KTAC which is supposed to cover EVERYTHING on the tractor. Fast forward a few months and it's time for a small part that broke. I went right to HMTC service dept only to find out that not only is the part not covered, but they don't even have the part in stock and will take a month to come in. Ok, chalk it up to bad luck. Another month or so later I head to HMTC again for simple parts and they have none in stock. This happened a total of 4 times and I finally give up. The management here is out of touch with the market and their customers. They refuse to hire competent, qualified employees. Even the lady and the front door acts like you're interrupting her day when you walk through the door. Never again will I do business with or recommend anyone to HMTC.

He however was not eager at all to work on my small engine stating stating; \"35 hp is not for him\".  I tried to explain that it was a minor switch repair which would be common sense to most mechanics and I just needed a little help and when I asked if I could at least bring it by for him to look at.

We brought our riding lawnmower in to be serviced and was charged $ 530 and got it home and started mowing and immediately started blowing black smoke. We were told to bring it back and they charged another $130 and then preceded to tell us that it would be an additional $1200 to replace the block that was worn out. Basically we spent $730 for unauthorized new parts to be told the lawnmower would not run without a new block. My suggestion to anyone that asks for repairs to be called with an estimate before you are charged for expensive parts that you did not authorize and do not even repair your mower. You don\u2019t know until you get home and it doesn\u2019t work and you are totally out the money with no repairs done. Everyone should expect an estimate before expensive repairs are done so you can determine  if worth your money. When we picked up the second time it would not even run to get on trailer and we left the lawnmower for parts after we made payment. We expect to pay for labor for diagnosis for problem but not about throwing our money away on a problem that was going to cost more than a new one. A complete rip off in my opinion. If anyone uses them do yourself a favor and tell them to not touch anything before asking for an estimate on repairs. Too late for us but if this saves someone else money it was worth this post!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888979c0d9f05fb5:0xa5549a100d197611"}

I purchased the items and was told to let him know when I could bring it back to have the seat put on. He told me he would need a week to get it mounted. i was helping a friend in the area and carried it by early Monday morning and that's when this guys true colors started showing. I passed by there about three or four times (didn't stop) between Monday and Thurs just to see if it was being worked on but it NEVER MOVED!!! I called on Fri morning and told them I needed to come get my mower (meaning I needed to cut my 3 + acres of grass and bring it back on Monday but I did not say that) and the lady I spoke with said she would let him know. I get a call back in about 10 mins and the same lady informs me that he (the owner) said that if I came and got MY mower he would never put that seat on for me. Well after going around and around with husqvarna Corp. They got me set up with a real dealer that knows how to treat people ..i have to drive farther but I don't have to put up with this clown. To tell you what kind of character you will be dealing with, when I started dealing with the other company, they inform me there isn't a suspension seat for my Z554 in the entire husqvarna corporation because it is a brand new model. I wonder how this guy had one? It's a MIRACLE!!!! Also, on Friday when I picked my mower up the fuel gauge on the left hand tank was showing empty, tank was full but not showing it. I saw several very negative reviews on this place before I bought but like an idiot I bought from this....GUY anyway.\nBIG MISTAKE!!!!!

The manager at the time did fix the problem. But I made a stupid mistake by buying something else that was more exspensive thinking it would be better, now they don\u2019t want to fix that again a few months back. On top of that I completely forgot to come in and make November\u2019s payments (normally someone would call me between the 1st and 10th just to remind me)(I\u2019m a mother of two and full time college student so I\u2019m forgetful when I don\u2019t get reminders) they called me last week while I was sitting in class so I asked them to call me back in a couple of hours to discuss why they had called. Didn\u2019t think nothing of it. Well today I got a letter in the mail saying I was avoiding them and refusing their calls (which I have not I answer every phone calll that comes in because I never know if something might have happened to someone) then the \u201cnew manager\u201d tried to say she delivered this letter to my house today. This letter has a stamp on it has been through the post office lines and was in my mailbox at the bottom of the box(I haven\u2019t checked my mail in three days so it was full) but she proceeds to tell me that my account which as of today is 30days late it wasn\u2019t 30days late when she sent this letter to me. That she would be sending it to the court house this week. And that she would not work with me because I\u2019m 30days late as of today. That this was policy after 30 days. I worked at this store in 2017 for a while and they normally don\u2019t send to collection until 120 days or later. She also tried to tell me they have been calling I have not received but that one call from them a little over a week ago when I asked them to call me back and they never did then my grandmother received a call from them last night and she told me today when she seen me. So hearing this plus receiving this letter today I did call them only to be told she wouldn\u2019t work with me. I also know that when I worked there and I would help the collector there to make calls you can just click in the computer saying that you called when really you didn\u2019t. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay her right now Christmas is a few weeks away my sons birthday is also the week of Christmas and my car payment is due this week so I offered to pay November and December\u2019s payment on December 28th the Friday right after the holidays she then told me I would have to pay court cost and do it that way because my account wouldn\u2019t be there any longer.\n\nI have been dealing with farmers for a couple of years now and I always pay my accounts off wayyy earlier than need to be.\nThis is also the first time I have ever been more than two days late on making a payment.

I have never even done reviews because it really depends on the day and person every where but this place is HORRIBLE!! First me and my husband bought an entertainment center and had to send it back 3 times for being damaged. The last time there was damage but you couldn\u2019t see it that bad so we just kept it. We should have learned our lesson then!! The next time we bought our daughter a new bedroom suit and we bought a new kitchen table. We knew it was on back order for the bedroom suit but the table would be in sooner. We were called when the table came in set up the delivery time. On the day of Delivery for the table our time was 2-5, at 5 when we had not heard anything I called the store. They gave me a number to call the delivery guys because they said they couldn\u2019t get ahold of their delivery guys. I\u2019m not sure how a customer was supposed to get ahold of the delivery guys before the actually store but I called anyways. Of course no answer. Called the store again and the manager just kept telling me he didn\u2019t know and to have my husband call him. Why do you need to speak with my husband when I\u2019m the one calling?? My husband called and we were finally told they found the truck but we need to reschedule the drop off! Nope we will not we need it today! Me and my husband went to the store and picked it up. We chalked it up to understaffed due to covid and left it at that although still upset the manager will not talk to me only my husband. Now for TODAY! Manger called my husband (although he has my number) told him all the furniture would be in on Tuesday. Rather then wait around on another pointless delivery fail we said we would go in today on Thursday to pick up the furniture. My husband goes in and\u2026. The manager said the furniture is not there and they can\u2019t find it\u2026.. WHAT?!?!? Are you kidding me?!?!? My husband calls me at work at this point I\u2019m done I\u2019m furious I call up there to see what\u2019s going on and the manager says YOUR TO UPSET I CANT TALK TO YOU! I WILL ONLY SPEAK WITH YOUR HUSBAND!!!  I have to call my husband (because I\u2019m at work and can\u2019t go up there and deal with it in person like I would like to) he has to call the store. Blah blah they offered him the furniture on the floor but the dresser is cracked! Are you kidding me no I\u2019m not taking a cracked dresser after all this nor would I take it before all of this.He tells my husband he can come get the bed and nightstand we will have to wait on the dresser of course . We said since that is our only option it will have to do but we will NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER buy from this store and I\u2019m going to corporate about all that has happened and how the manager here has a problem with speaking to woman!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb33dd87097c5:0x750da89af599d5ef"}

I asked that he put the good motor on the good bike. We had a gentleman's agreement that I would pay more than a thousand dollars, and that would include two new tires. After looking closer at the tires I had I found that I had two good tires between the two bikes. I tried calling to check on the progress on my bike, but wasn't able to speak with anyone. Phill, the owner tells me, when I went in to check on my bike, that they got trash in my carbs. He had the carbs off my bike and was supposedly cleaning them. When he called me and told me my bike was ready I picked it up and only two cylinders was firing, the clutch was slipping, and the carbs were pouring gas. I took it back  the same day under the 30 day warranty to have it properly fixed. When he called me that my bike was ready and I went to pick it up he tries to charge me another $350.00. I called the police out to try and get my bike, but they said they couldn't get invovled and I would have to pay the money or get an attorney. I didn't trust him to leave my bike any longer, so paid the money to get my bike. My bike is sitting in my yard with the carbs still flooding out. After more than $1,400 dollars spent and I still can't drive my bike. If you value your property, do not take it to Prattville power sports. I'm getting an attorney and going to court.\n\nToday June 4, 2019, I had the pleasure of meeting the new owners of Prattville power sports. I had bought a new battery from phill when he done the work on my bike. Today I found out that the battery he put in my bike wasn't the same battery he said he put in. That it was a cheaper version, but he charges me for the more expensive battery. The new owner pulled out the old bills and showed me the difference and then gave me the battery that I was suppose to have from the beginning. I now believe and tmhave complete trust in the new owners and plan to do my business with them now that I know phill is gone. Thank you Prattville power sports.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e8d8e6b3a3f67:0x795dbd54e08d38af"}

They said that they would have someone come out to pick it up and that they would call the day before they were supposed to pick it up (scheduled for today 4 Oct) and give me a time. They were also supposed to call the day of pick up to let me know they were on the way.\n\nStill haven't received a phone call and it it currently 4:21 pm. They close at 5 pm.

She was out sick since New Year's. She made our purchase good and replaced the damaged furniture. However, I am going to leave the initial review below this update, and raise the stars to a 3 instead of 1. This store really needs to evaluate their customer service skills and improve by taking care of issues in a timely manner.\nInitial Review:\nHorrible experience! Do not shop here! They sold us defective furniture that damaged our hardwood floors and no-one returns the calls. The delivery men were still at my house when I showed them the sofa was reclining and digging into the floors! The sofa reclined and left a deep two-foot-long scratch in our new hardwood floors. They replaced the sofa on Dec 31 and I showed them the loveseat is lopsided. They tried to fix it but couldn't. It has been over three weeks and these people do not return your calls nor stand behind their products! Don't shop here! I wish I had read these reviews before we shopped with Farmers! We are going to buy new bedroom furniture and a new refrigerator, but not from farmers!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3eb779ad56f1:0x7f6c018c2a9b38db"}
