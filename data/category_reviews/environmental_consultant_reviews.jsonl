My A/C is an older unit but after they finished sealing the attic and installing new insulation, I see a marked difference in how much it kicks on each day. 3-4 times throughout the day vs not holding a temp and running most of the day continuously when it's hot outside. Very pleased. Will use him in the future and he comes HIGHLY recommended!\n\nJW", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8d7a628e2b:0xf5298ef0d0e349bc"}

He not only explained the issues but showed us the issues using advanced technology. He communicated with us as needed. All work was completed timely.\nJason, the crew leader, was professional, courteous and respectful of our home and space. Jason went above and beyond our expectations. He and his crew not only did excellent work, Jason \"uncovered\" a probelm unrelated to the scope of our project but he said he would do some research to find out the best solution. Now that is excellent customer service. He even said he would come back out once this problem was fixed to make sure the insulation was proper in this small space.\nBoth Jason and David are very knowledge and answered all of our questions in terms that we understood.\nI recommend this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1488552465882, "text": "We enjoyed working with you, DeWight!

They will not work with you, yells and screams instead of acting professionally (Walker is who we dealt with) and will absolutely avoid you if they cannot resolve the matter. I would absolutely encourage you to look elsewhere. I see the other reviews but I guessing they are freinds and family posting those reviews.

Coincidentally, that other company happened to be an ex-employee of there's and had said he had left and started his own company due to the same reasons metioned above.

I live in Pensacola FL and felt that my 3700 sq ft house (10 years old) needed a little insulation (top-off)  help.\n\nSo I got the usual 3 estimates and heard the analysis and sales pitch of each, and evaluated each of them as a Chemical Engineer, that I am.\n\nThe summary is that two of the three Contractors gave me a over-sell pitch of everything that that I needed (which I knew that I didn't need).  Only Walker Goodrich of ECO -three gave me that real pitch and actually-talked me out of unnecessary work when I pitched to Walker what the other contractors said I needed.\n\nThe bottom line ( literally) was that Eco-Three quoted $2850 for the job,, while the other two contractors quoted about $12,000 and $8,000, respectively.\n\nOnce I awarded the Contract to Eco-three, they did what they promised and when they said they would do it, and in a very neat way.\n\nStarting the day of instillation Feb 24 2018, my average daily electricity usage dropped 33%  (for equivalent outside temperature highs and lows) relative to before the insulation was added.\n\nAnother  energy saving tip is to replace your AC single-speed pool pump motor with a low energy (variable speed) pump motor.  I did it last year for $800 installed and with it on 8 hours per day, everyday, my power consumption cost just for the pump dropped abut $100-$125 per month.\n\nI hope that this helps\n\nDon B", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8d7a628e2b:0xf5298ef0d0e349bc"}
