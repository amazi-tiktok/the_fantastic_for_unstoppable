I am sitting here in a hot house waiting on the a/c man... it's almost one pm my time and he calls me just before and tells me that he isn't coming out today I needed to call the warranty company and have them schedule someone else to come out. there are plenty of contractors in Phenix City that could come out today (did he call them and ask to see, hell no), he tells me that there is no way that he can come out he has an emergency at the hospital. that is understandable but why can't you send someone other than yourself to check my unit? He tells me that it isn't that hot outside that it could wait till Monday. This man knows that I have seven month old child as well as a four year old and he has the balls to tell me that it can wait because it isn't hot? The next time my baby throws up on me I will make sure I call him so she can do it to him. she can't be in the heat she has too many problems for it and he is not worth the time of day or the money you will spend.

I had called another company for a second opinion and they diagnosed a different and very expensive problem.  When I told their tech what the SMS tech had diagnosed, he suddenly changed his diagnosis without doing any additional tests.  The SMS technician explained why that couldn't be the problem, explained what the gauges were showing him and fixed the correct problem with the unit.  And it did cost less.

The owner, Shane, is very personable and the kind of guy you can trust with your door unlocked. Opie (dead ringer for a younger Ron Howard), his technician, is a relatively young guy (23), but mature beyond his years and a very good HVAC tech. He's also trustworthy and the kind of guy you would want to represent your company. Most importantly, he was able to diagnose my heat pump problem quickly and efficiently...10 to 15 minutes. The HVAC was over amped.\n\nThe company that installed my TRANE XL14 heat pump in 2007, Alabama Climate Control (ACC) of Huntsville, apparently did not notice that the heat pump was rated for max amperage of 40 amps because they did not bother to change the 50 amp circuit breaker in the panel in the garage. One would expect a professional HVAC company to do a basic electrical circuit check/test to ensure the electrical circuit is compatible with your NEW heat pump...right!?!?\n\nAnyway, this oversight by ACC resulted in a fried circuit breaker in the junction box at the heat pump. Opie said we were lucky this situation did not result in a burned up motor or worse a burned down house. After all that, Opie tried to give me a $25 discount because I'm a veteran.\n\nThank you for the sentiment Opie, but also thank you for identifying a problem that has caused me great anguish over the years. I had to replace 3 or 4 compressors on the original heat pump (a Rheem) about 15 years ago when we first started renting out the house.\n\nThe HVAC company (same ACC) kept replacing all those compressors under warranty at $250 to $300 a pop for labor, but just couldn't figure out what was causing all those compressors to burn up (the same 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker box). Then, I was dumb enough to hire them again to install a new TRANE in 2007. Remeber, the TRANE is rated for a maximum of 40 amps, but ACC left the same old 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker panel. Voila...we get a fried junction box this time.\n\nIncredible...that it took a young 23 year old tech with a lot less experience (but more common sense and intelligence) to recognize that a 50 amp circuit breaker is going to eventually cause some problems if it is not compatible with the rest of the circuit.\n\nThe cautionary tale here is...be extremely vigilant and careful about who you let work on your electrical systems and watch them like a hawk when they do...until you find a company like SMS that has techs like Opie.. Thank you SMS and Opie for saving my house from a potential fire.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462206716420, "text": "Thanks Dwight! We are very happy we could take care of your heat pump needs!
