The morning of surgery, Dr. Habermacher came into room I ask if he was going to do scan to make sure stone was gone, he replied no, it will be gone today one way or another. I had passed very small pieces of stone but definitely not a 7mm in prior week.When I awoke from procedure I was told there was no stone, after getting home I was very sick from procedure and very sore. I went for my follow-up, I told the girl that checked me in that I was upset that he did not do KUB to make sure the stone was gone also, that I am a nurse and have had enough of kidney stone patients to know how to check for kidney stones and I definitely had not passed a 7mm. She said I will tell him, she immediately came back in room and said this is a nurse visit, he wants you to do 24 hr urine and come back in 2 months. I have no intentions of ever using him again, why would you not do a KUB or scan to make sure it's gone before putting someone through this, it sounds like it's all about money to me.

Personally, if you are considering this place, I would just run like H3LL.  I had symptoms of acid reflux and had an ENT confirm what I thought it was.  I asked to get an endo done just to ensure my throat did not have Barrett's.  They referred me for the procedure and one of the female doctor's performed the endo.  Prior to this I had never met this doctor.  I explained my acid reflux and she said it could be my gallbladder since I had a child 1.5 years prior.  She recommended an ultrasound and hyda scan.  I went in for both and it was found that I did have a gallstone.  The hyda scan was normal.  The gastro doc immediately referred me to a surgeon to have my gallbladder removed.  I was blown away!  I had never had any typical gallbladder attacks or pain.  After doing more research I found out that having your gallbladder removed can actually cause bile reflux due to the constant free flow of bile into your system once the gallbladder is removed and the bile has no where else to go.  This doctor could not even read details of my ultra sound so I had to rely on some random doctor (over the phone) to tell me that yes, I have a rather large stone.  This female gastro doc never made any follow up appointment with me.  I immediately canceled the surgery.  I have since discussed this decision with other doctors (ENT and family doctor) and they agree with my decision.  My one gallstone while big is not currently causing typical symptoms.  There is absolutely no guarantee that removal of my gallbladder will fix the acid reflux.  And, recently, my acid reflux has been manageable with a proper clean (and green) diet. Folks, after doing much research, I am convinced that probably millions of Americans have gallstones.  Why?  Diet, it's that simple.  Our diet is just too high in fat, salt, and sugar amongst other things.  A lot of people have gallstones without even knowing UNLESS they have a gallbladder attack that lands them in the ER (or in my case was found just by chance).  In my opinion, gallbladder pain and recurrent attacks are reasons to remove the gallbladder.  Yes, you can live without your gallbladder but you can also live without your arm.  Your body functions better with both so unless you are having issues, think really hard about whether it's worth losing an organ.  In very rare cases, gallbladder disease in the form of stones can lead to major illnesses like cancer.  However, IF you drastically improve your diet, I do believe you can control your destiny.  Remember, everything begins in the gut!  Obviously, I am not a medical doctor, so these opinions are my own.  My last words of advice: get 2 or 3 opinions and remember that doctors are in the business to make money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a680bf0c7d7:0x1d6cad2459ca0d12"}

I hardly had an entire 2 minutes to explain to him what was going on before I was all of a sudden waking up in the recovery room. No courtesy to say \"hey, were starting the anesthesia.\" He was interested in the colonoscopy and getting it over and never asked me the first important question. And the symptoms I tried to tell him with details, kept getting muffled out by him talking to other medical personnel in the room. No chance to let him know that I was interested in having an endoscopy as well because my symptoms don't even pertain to my large intestine and possibly not even the end of my small intestine. So now my symptoms are still present and have no follow up appointment with him. Instead, they tell my wife to make me an appointment with a refered family doctor an entire month away. Not to mention my colonoscopy appointment took almost 2 months until they could do it.  Wouldn't have wasted my 500.00 that my insurance wouldn't cover, if I would have known that it wouldn't help me get my foot in the door to the gastro office.
