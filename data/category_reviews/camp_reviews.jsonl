I think back on those days of freedom and fun often and wish I could turn back time one more time.\nIf you're thinking of sending your young man to a summer camp I highly recommend Camp Laney.

I had the ability to go when our youth camp decided to come for summer camp. The camp is run through Student Life Camps and has an amazing group of staff and individuals that help the camp run. The guys in our group including me stayed in Mount Moriah, which is one of the many lodging buildings available to stay in. The rooms were clean and fresh bedding was provided, although we brought our own. I opted to use the provided bedding. The rooms had two bunk beds for a maximum capacity of 4 people. The lower level of Mount Moriah (we stayed in the top level--a two story building) has a nice little lobby area with some chairs and a couch. Some guys in our group thought it would be funny to take the couch upstairs and place it in front of our leader's room. We returned the couch afterwards.\n\nThe rest of the camp was very beautiful and well kept. There were some lawn care professionals maintaining the grounds while we stayed.\n\nThe recreation area, known as the \"Adventure Camp\" was very nice. The pool was large enough for our group to comfortably play in, as well as others. A diving board added to the fun. The Tennis courts and Basketball courts were very nice and well kept, but you will need to bring your own tennis supplies, as they are not provided. There was a small \"lake\" on camp grounds, with paddle boarding, and some water inflatables. We did not decide to go on these as they cost an extortionate amount of $8 for 30 mins of play. Not worth it.\n\nIt would we worth nothing that everything is fairly spread apart and there are some very intense hills throughout, which took a toll on our legs and knees. Golf Cart rentals were available for $35/day, but we had too many in our group that it would cost too much, so we didn't do it.\n\nThe food service was very nice, the food tasted adequate and there was always a variety to choose from. It is a self serve food line, so you are free to eat what you choose. A nice addition is the unlimited complimentary Soft Serve Ice Cream available at each and every meal.\n\nOverall I have to say Shocco Springs is one of my favourite camps that I've been to. Sure it's a little hot here in Alabama, but that's fine. Just bring some water, and going swimming can help tremendously.\n\n-Matthew J., age 15 at time of writing. Visited From June 1-5, 2016.
