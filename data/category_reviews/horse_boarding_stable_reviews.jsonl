Suzanne has never been arrested (lol) and is very committed to the upkeep and welfare of her farm. I can attest to this by the many, many days I have been there. the horses are feed twice a day as they should be and are given the correct and necessary treatment. I have even shadowed the large animal vet rocking s uses and she does a fine job. the stalls are always, always cleaned twice a day. I know this because Im usually cleaning them. if suzanne ever lacks help she will muck stalls on her own. she cares for her horses and only gives jobs to the people who clean the stalls correctly, which some how seemed to be quite hard for some. yes the kids help w chores but that's part of the whole horse riding experience. it's great that she includes the kids in this. it teaches them responsibility. by taking care of the animals the kids bond with them and learn the necessities of taking care of horses. farriers come to the barn regularly for saddlebreds and the other horses. it is a wonderful little barn full of wonderful people. the negative reviews on here are honestly absurd and obviously don't know what they're talking about.\n\nalso a negative reviewer posted a picture on here. horses who live in pastures are going to get scratched. it's absolutely inevitable. I've owned many horses before who have been pasture boarded and different barns and can say this w full knowledge. it is not evidence that rocking s farm is unsuitable. the horse doesn't need a vet to some out it only needs for the wound to be cleaned and medicated (which it has been).", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888926b13ffc3793:0x3b11f57783e3b6d6"}

I have no clue what \" an immersive experience\" is  . We DO arrange for some tours as an informative and educational experience. WE DO have working students and volunteers here from time to time. HOWEVER, The owners do not wish their horses to be disturbed and in fact , we do not accept boarders that have other needs than what we offer here. When that happens they are referred to another facility in the area more suitable for their needs. WE do have stable owned horses that are used for this educational experience.I cannot imagine anyone here who and received information that a person just wanted to have a child look at a horse responded like that. We board and offer therapeutic and great care for horses and every minute is spent with caring for the animals here.\nWe are a serious equine facility that gives complete care to horses and go beyond the norm to achieve the best care for all here. .IF a person calls and does not get what they perceive as the response they want, we can not be responsible for that. You cannot judge the facility's level of care which is why we are in this business, with the fact someone does not like how they were talked to.
