Maybe he didn't have anyone to give the keys to.\"\n\n________________________________________\n\nso on so forth.\n\nBecause of the lost time, the mechanic shop might have to keep my car over the weekend instead of identifying the problem Thurs. & having parts to the store Friday morning.\n\nSave yourself the headache if you have a choice - choose ANYONE but Hub City.

So I call finance company which is a whole other story. My car was never supposed to have been picked up to start with. But they send release for my car. So I immediately call 24/7 recovery to get my car. No answer called for hours with no response to messages or emails. So finally drive to carbon hill and hour from me. No one is there. There were two more numbers on the sign repeatedly call them no answer or straight to voicemail with no response to messages. Finally contact several other recovery companys in carbon hill even reach out to the police because by now I have walked the property and my car is no where to be found. Find out that 24/7 has a holding lot in hueytown which is where I just drove from. Go back home and call again all day Sunday with once again no response. Now here it is Monday morning I have called they now say they have no release for my car so call bank they had to send it twice because first time recovery says they did not receive it. So now 24/7 hasn't release but surprise I still can't have my car. Because we are under a state of emergency for \"POTENTIAL\" winter weather. POTENTIAL! So I am told I can't get my car until Thursday. Ok so can I have my stuff because I have to work and all my equipment is in my car. Now they can go to work and I'm sure go tow wrecked cars but they can not unlock the lot where my car is so that me a essential healthcare worker can either get my things for work or my car.

The get zero stars from me. My car was towed and I was told that it was taken to Twenty Four Seven Recovery. So lets start on 01/15/2020 I called around 9 AM maybe 10 am to set up an appointment (because as you know if you call the number that they provide for you you have to set up an appointment because they have many different locations.) So I did just that. My appointment was set for 01/23/2020 (A WEEK LATER) from 3-4. So of course I has to leave work at 2 in order to get my things out my car because Carbon Hill is 1 hr away from where I'm located. I get there and I overhear one of the ladies say that the car has been there for 8 days ( which makes no sense that means the car would've been there when I set up the appointment.) So the lady that was assisting me tells me because they did not have the key to my trunk they couldn't get the stuff out of there and my car is in Hueytown which of course I can't make because they stop taking appointments at 330 and it was 315 before I even got to Carbon Hill. So I asked her ya'll didn't think to call me and she responds oh we just found out like right now. LIKE HOW???????????????????????????????????????????? Do ya'll not have notifications for appointments? So I wasted money because I had to put gas in my car and I wasted time that I will NEVER get back. All it took was for them to call me.

She said they already had the order put in. The lady at Hanks was so rude.  They were talking about us and saying he muted it but it was not. I have it all recorded. The lady at Hanks said it will be $325 to pick it up because Geico said to leave it in their lot which they did not. So Geico told her she was having someone come pick it up and give payment. 1 hour later they said they were closing and that someone could get it Monday Morning.

The tow truck the police called out to pick my truck were nice and quick, But when they asked where I wanted them to take it to, they seemed a little bit annoyed that I wanted it to go to my home, as I wanted to talk with my insurance agent first. I suppose they prefer taking them to their place or a body shop.\nWhen they unloaded my truck, a good bit of the plastic from the headlight and grill fell out on the tow truck, And the driver just brushed it off into my yard where my truck was sitting. I didn't think much of it, I'd just clean it up in the morning when I went out to take pictures to start working with my insurance.\nI talked to my insurance, They told me because it's a newer model truck,  That they would have someone from their salvage provider come pick it up, I believe it was 3 days later when I got a call from a lady from IIA or IAA, saying that she was about to be giving a driver the information to come pickup my truck and verified my address and the damages with me.\nNot too terrible long after I spoke with her and said ok to having another tow truck company come out, Joey actually called me when he was roughly 30 minutes away from my home to verify my address and that everything was ready to go. He showed up just as he said and came to the door and got me to explain why he was there, And actually gave me the rundown on the process of what would happen if progressive did or did not total my truck. I handed off my keys to him, He went and got  his truck from the street and backed it in to where he'd be able to load it up. Before he backed up into the location, he did ask me if I had septic in the area (I I didn't)  He said he always asks when he has to enter a yard,  Said he's never had a problem with accidentally finding a tank but really didn't want to have to make phone calls explaining a problem!  LOL!\nHe got down under my truck and did his work with some chains, Put it in neutral to wind it up his truck and chain it down. Now, this is where I became surprised,  He picked up every piece of plastic and debris that had come from my truck and put them in the bed. I never asked him to!\nI asked why he did and he said he wanted it to be just as if he and my injured truck were never there. I'm still amazed that there a people that have that mindset.\nWe talked for a few more minutes as he finished loading and chained my truck down, I asked where they were out of and he gave me a business card with everything on it. I'm in Chilton county, So it's not feasible for me to call a company that's an hour plus away,  But he told me that you have trucks all over the place at any given time, And to call if I needed help, That you might be right down the street!\nAs I said early on, I never thought that my best experience in this headache would have been the guy that picked up my truck and towed from my home to Progressive's auction yard. It ended up being totaled,  But I'm loving my new blue f150!\nThank you to Joey and Hank's!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580148883770, "text": "That is so amazing to hear, Brian!

We have had not one, but TWO horrible experiences with this tow service. The first time, they left my 70 year old Father stranded in 90\u00b0 weather for hours on end, we have AAA and they assigned Hank's to the tow job. They accepted the job and didn't call/notify/cancel the job to give my Dad the opportunity to get another company assigned to the job, they just left him stranded!!! Then, my husband called them last night and they accepted his request for a tow directly,no AAA,  he called them himself since they were close. They told him they would be there in no more than 45 minutes. 1 hour later, no word. He calls them back, they say they took another job and would get him as soon as they finished. 3 HOURS LATER, my husband is still stranded and calls them for the third time. They end up telling him he may be better off calling another company. God forbid what would have happened or how long my husband would have waited if leaving it up to them to follow up on a service they accepted to begin with. Y'all are clearly in the wrong business, and people can be seriously hurt or have personal things in their life that an be SEVERELY affected by your negligence and lack of consideration. Thank God they weren't on their way to work or something pressing that required a timely arrival. Lesson learned. I will be sure to let AAA know to never assign this business to my tow jobs again, and I would recommend the same to all of you, unless you want yourself and loved one's to be stuck out in the middle of the night with no help or in the blistering Alabama heat.

I explained from the beginning my parents are old, I am recovering from surgery from the day before. No attempt to be understanding or empathetic.

Week after week of not being kept up to date, and hearing excuse after excuse as to why, 2 months later car is ready. Car feels great, except for a weird rumbling sensation that wasn't there before. Oh well, not sure what it is. Notice a bolt just sitting in the console that wasn't there before. Turns out they didn't even connect the steering column.

After getting the motor in it was knocking called and talked to a lady who said owner wasn\u2019t in and he\u2019ll give me a call back, he never called me back. I called a couple days later and he answered I let him know what was going on and he said you only have a 30 day warranty, when in fact my paperwork states I had 60. Thank god I had kept the receipt. He told me I had to fill out the warranty paperwork and present receipts. Ok no problem but on the warranty form it states that the timing belt needs to be replaced, this engine has a chain. He informed me that regardless belt or chain it\u2019s all the same. Well I got some news from you buddy there not, a chain shouldn\u2019t have to be serviced under normal conditions, a belt yes I agree it does. But if the motor is knocking that has nothing to do with it. This is a fair warning for anyone purchasing from here he will not refund your money and will think of any way possible not too, and he uses the square app which makes things much harder to get a refund through your credit card. But I am happy to say after over 8 months I have received my refund and hope this guy flies out of business and really feels it.

I called Seamon later that afternoon to inquire about how much it would cost to get out, and the lady said, \"$180.00 today, plus $20 per day that it sits here. After 2 weeks, we claim it as an unclaimed/abandoned vehicle and that's an extra $75 plus the extra $20 per day, and to have the car taken to my house, it would have to be towed. And guess what that means: Another towing fee. I understand needing to run a business and having to charge fees, but that is absolutely ridiculous! The car isn't totalled, but because of their outrageously overpriced fees that I can't afford, I can't get it back or any of the new parts I recently put in it.

My sales manager was returning from vacation in a company owned Suburban and was rear ended by a vehicle going in excess of 100mph which caused the Suburban to flip on it's passenger side and then the roof and slide down the road till the headliner started to catch fire while the occupants were hanging upside down by their seatbelts, including his pregnant wife, who was understandably traumatized. It was impossible to retrieve personal items due to all the broken glass and by the time the wrecker had the vehicle right side up they were in route to the hospital. After being cleared from the Hospital they had to rent a car and then called Seamon Wrecker to come and get their clothes and work computer. The female dispatch person demanded to see a title to prove he owned the Suburban in order to let him have his personal belongings. This was not a release of the vehicle, only clothes and computer, both very easy to verify who the owners are, including the police report showing they had just been driving this vehicle. This being a company vehicle, the titles are in the company safe until sold and being after hours it is impossible to produce a title. As the owner of the company who owned the Suburban I called on behalf of my sales manager and tried to explain the situation, prove ownership, and authorize his retrieving his personal belongings. The female dispatch person was extremely abusive of the power she held, showing no interest to listen, help, or understand, comparing the situation to a person taking a car without paying for it which made no sense, and then hanging up on me. There is no job that justifies a person disregarding the humanity of others. It's one thing to ignore the wounded traveler on the side of the road and not help as the Samaritan did, but even in that parable no one went out of their way to kick the traveler. A innocent victim of a violent collision with a pregnant wife would elicit some degree of compassion from almost anyone, However, this person seemed to relish the abuse and hardship that was in her power to dish out. At this moment our salesmanager is driving home without his belongings, and hopefully will be able to retrieve them tomorrow. I will consider revising this review if there is any sign of helpfulness tomorrow as I have reached out by email to the company. So far the one person on duty displayed what can only be described as soulless behavior. She may be going through an extremely hard life herself but if her intent is to make everyone in her world miserable, she is succeeding.\nUPDATE Saturday: No response to my email but with an abundance of paperwork, today my salesmanager was able to retrieve his belongings. He took a picture of a sign on the wall that said the attitude you display is the attitude you get back....ironic. The person on duty today was not the nightmare  that the woman last night was so for that I give 2 stars instead of one. The sad fact is no one looks at reviews for a wrecker company before calling one as it is usually an emergency so I'm sure this will do no harm but at least others who without a doubt are going to have horrible experiences with this company can know they are not crazy and they are not alone.

Tony\u2019s showed up loaded up my truck and I asked how much it would be he said insurance has it covered. My insurance is liability only and did not cover the towing as he assumed. For them to tow the truck 1.6 miles it cost me $200. I had other options but when I explained this to them again they don\u2019t care. If it\u2019s ever a choice do not use them.

He lifted the hood and told me to try to start my vehicle. Before I could even start it, liquid was spraying out of a tube and he confirmed that it was gas that was leaking out. He told me that I can go to an auto shop to get it fixed. He gave me two choices whether to take to my vehicle to my house or take it to an auto shop for someone to fix. It was almost 6:00 p.m. so I told him that I would take it to an auto shop the next day and that he could take the vehicle to my house. Surprisingly, he offered to help fix the issue with my vehicle. I told him he didn't have to but he said he wanted to help. He towed the vehicle to an auto parts retailer where I purchased the parts that he needed for $3. Overall, he said that it would cost me $65 for him to do all of this instead of the $75 for just  towing the vehicle to my house. I told him that was so nice of him to do that for me and I thanked him for it.  He fixed the leaking issue with my vehicle and I offered to give him a $5 tip to go along with the $65 but he said it was my choice to give him a tip.

Oil and smoke everywhere! I called in and they arrived within 30mins as they were located a little away. I dealt with Ben specifically and he was genuine, easy to talk with and very intelligent. He knew exactly where to go to get me a new drain plug. Not only that but he didn't leave until he actually crawled up underneath my truck to correctly install the drain plug and ensured I was good to go as I didn't have a jack to place my heavy trailer back on my truck.

Last time I had my truck towed the driver messed the truck up even more than it was so this was a big plus in my eyes. He asked me where i wanted the truck at and put it exactly where i needed it. I highly recommend them. I didnt really compare prices so I dont know how much cheaper they are compared to others but I dont mind paying more for a good experience and have someone who keeps me updated on their location and actually knows what they are doing. Cody was a huge help and very knowledgeable.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c92ac7c054ecf:0x43cae534ce11fbe"}

I didn't see any no parking signs anywhere and when I went to get  out of impound I said to the the guy at the desk, I guess the owner, I said there's not any no parking signs there! He said \"oh yes there is, WE'RE THE ONES THAT MADE THEM AND PUT THEM THERE!! It's that even legal?.. So they are in cahoots with the property manager or owner of Hayesland and Hamilton. I went back the next time I was in town to look for these signs and they're so small you can barely see em. They are maybe 1x1 ft! If these are the kind of people that work there and own the place, I will never use their service and I recommend everyone else don't do business with them either. Oh and not only that but it COST ME CLOSE TO $300 to tow it maybe 10 miles! I ALMOST LOST MY JOB!! My company said if it happens again or if I were to work for any other trucking company I would have lost my job over these scam artists.... Ever heard of karma??.....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b30df988f25:0xefb4401100958fbe"}

The company he'd sent in his place just hemmed and hawed about how it couldn't be done, the third company came and joined the chorus of I can't for this reason or that.\nThen... we called Roadside Towing in Huntsville, AL.

He refused to put my car down, despite the fact that I had already called Triple A & they were on the way to come get my car.\nHe continued to say that as long as I came to the lot to pick my car up within 24 hours, it was free of charge.\nI called the business, once I got home, and the man that I spoke with(who claimed to be the owner) had, again, a different story. Once he started to inform me of the charges to get my car back, I told him that his employee said it would be free until the end of the 24 hour day. He called his employee on 3 way, and Mr. Bishop lied, once again, saying he properly informed me of the charges.\nAfter asking for his name as well, the man I was speaking with gave me the name \"Jack Ass.\"  That was his second time cursing at me through out the conversation, the first being him telling me I needed to \"hop my ass in a car and come get my car.\"\nFrom another source, I learned that the owner's name is James Bepew.

Even more so on weekends, as they are only there for limited hours on Saturday and Sunday, and then only on the third weekend of every month. They assess a full day storage fee of $25 regardless of them being present at their impound lot to release a vehicle. They also state that it is their right to charge a full day of storage if they bring your vehicle to their lot before 12 am on any day. So if they tow it at 10 pm and get to the lot at 11:00 pm, it is their right to charge your tow fee and a full day of storage for that evening, as well as a full day of storage for the next day, even if you are there the second they open. So for example, if they tow your property 6.8 miles on a Friday evening, you can expect a $150 tow fee and multiple days of storage fees, when you can't even get it on most Saturdays or Sundays. Even if they are there on a Saturday or Sunday, sometimes they don't inform their answering service. This situation happened to me, though they only charged me for 2 days of storage. They informed me of this information and these policies while indicating I was lucky, because they could have made it worse. Just understand their tow policies before you hire them to recover your vehicle. In my situation, they towed my stolen motorcycle after a thief wrecked it, subsequent to a police pursuit. This is not a scathing review, and they to the best of my knowledge did a great job towing.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d482ffe9a4e85:0x29f0f5cf329aa52"}
