The ointment caused a blistering chemical burn that caused the skin to peel off. I contacted the store to let them know that their ointment caused a chemical burn and I was told that it couldn't have possibly been caused by their product and that it was an allergic reaction. All I wanted was to let them know that their product caused harm so that they could test their sample before giving it out to anyone else. Instead of an apology or even saying they would check it out all I got was accusations that it couldn't possibly have been from their ointment. I should have known better because it was probably never tested or FDA approved but some homemade remedy they are just selling out of the shop. BUYER BEWARE! Don't buy from this store.
