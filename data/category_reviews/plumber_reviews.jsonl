Had to go back in through the tile and found out the valve was never turned on/tested to the tub.  The rough-in work to the shower ended up being so poorly done, we are having to hire another plumber to come out and go in through the wall to fix the shoddy work that was done.  The plumber that came out to do this initial work was too concerned with having to leave early to officiate a soft ball game.  The worst thing about it is the owner is not standing behind his work and fixing himself. He has repeatedly blown me off and will not come back out.  I could also go in to how he threatened legal action if I didn't pay him for partial work before the job was completed, but that is another story.  If he is that concerned about needing money before a total job is completed, not a reputable plumber.  Beware", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889338819de61b7:0xea3f1db7e03a5777"}

Last year when a Hurricane blew through town, I had suffered roof damage along with many of my neighbors. Being fortunate and not actually displaced from my residence, I opted to wait a few months to solicit repair estimates while those who needed immediate help were being serviced.\n\nWhen the rush had died down (or so I thought), I reached out to multiple companies for estimates. I quickly realized that getting someone out to even give me an estimate was going to be a challenge. Numerous companies offered to come out but none actually followed through. Until I found Davis Roofing! They arrived within a few days at the precise time I was promised. A detailed professional estimate was provided to me and my insurance company for a complete roof replacement.\n\nUpon acceptance by my insurer, they asked me for my business.  At this point, they were the only company to respond. I took a chance with a single estimate, mostly because of promptness, professionalism and effective communication. I was not disappointed!\n\nDriving through my subdivision, I have the best roof in the neighborhood! The price I was quoted was the price that I paid. An addendum was even sent to my insurance company (by them) for additional expenses to be paid to me. That was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe efforts and communication of this group did not end when the job was over. I have been contacted multiple times over the last year with inquiries on my satisfaction. What more could I want? With this latest communication, I made mention of a single shingle that had slipped and looked crooked on the eve above my front door. The customer service representative promised to have the repair crew out to fix it. It happened the next day!\n\nFolks, I don't do many Google reviews. It takes a lot to impress me! Suffice to say, Restoration Services has done so and has earned my business going forward. I like the fact that they have expanded their offerings to include electrical services as well. I know they will be there, if needed. They will be my only call!

The disposal was easy, but the bathroom was a bit trickier since he didn't know what he would find behind the wall. He walked me through the steps he was taking and provided a price range based on what he might find once he got started which was helpful.

Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as it could have been and itwas easily fixed in one visit.\n\nThe 9-1 team is on time, professional, and affordable.

I originally called around looking for a plumber to fix the tub and sink and was quoted for around $200-250.  Klein charges by the hour, but they work fast to make sure they get the job done as quickly as possible.  Even with adding the extra fixes, they would have been cheaper than the other quotes I got for just the tub and sink.  The only reason I ended up paying more than $200 is because I needed a new garbage disposal.  I would most definitely recommend Klein Plumbing to anyone looking for a plumber.

The plumber called my cell and left a message stating he was real close to my house (20 miles away!) and did I want him to come on to my house; I never called him back.  I am very disappointed that this turned out this way after being so impressed with the first visit; but live and learn; now I have to find someone else to call.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88861ec390998cbd:0xe2d62bd58c9c99f7"}

I would rather bail buckets of water to my back porch for the rest of the week than do business with a company that accepts this as customer service. Thus, I cancelled my interest in following through with the repairs. There was also an issue with price discrepancy. The web listed free estimates. It seemed reasonable however they would charge $60.00 to come from the Gadsden to Leeds area but the technician indicated it would be $89.00. He did offer to honor the price but it was dishonored by not showing up or calling. It is of course unclear if this was the intent. I will say they were all very nice if you just want to talk to nice and seemingly knowledgeable people about plumbing.\n\nAddendum: \"I see that a reply has been offered by the owner, \"I'm sorry, call and we will make it right\" Before spending more time talking about the idea of services, I would need to know how this would be made right. For instance, if I have received the repairs elsewhere (since this was well over a month ago), will I receive some reimbursement for such? I cannot imagine someone being so generous as to do such a thing.\nOr if I have not had the repairs done, will I receive an offer no one could possibly refuse in exchange for the prior bad service. Maybe if I have an idea about whether the call is worthwhile vs a pre-scripted customer service response, I might call. Thanks for responding though.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618442927832, "text": "We are sorry for the misunderstanding. Please give us a call & we will make it right!

Nice , clean,  professional and $350 less expensive.\n\nI should point out that I cannot judge the quality of their work. All  other reviews indicate they are good at what they do. Their inability to not show without notice was the cause for my low review. We had family plans related to their work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563560476089, "text": "We regret that we could not get to you last week on Thursday, the day you scheduled for, and that you elected to go with another company. That day all of our plumbers except for the one assigned to do the work at your home already had very time sensitive, pressing, all day jobs that were presceduled to get started on early in the morning. Although the plumber assigned to you was called out to an emergency job early that morning we still had every intention of having him still come out to install your regulators and the extra line for your home as planned for that day. It wasnt until the morning started to progress forward in time that he realized he would not be able to get to you as planned due to him still diligently working to restore water at an elderly lady's home where she called very early that morning and said she had been without water since the day before so we had him rush right over. It was around mid morning at the time that he realized he wouldn't be able to make it to you as planned and we had to make the decision to attempt to reschedule with you since her emergency took presidence. Each and every customer and each job is truly important to us, we care greatly about the work that we do, our customers and how we serve them. We take pride in striving daily for complete satisfaction with every customer so we are very sorry to hear about your dissatisfaction. Sometimes there are circumstances and emergency situations that arise out of our control to where we may not be able to stick to our schedule as planned. Normally in a situation like that we would have just had one of our other plumbers come out that day in his place but each of them on that specific day were already on very pressing jobs that would take all day. That was a rare occasion but again sometimes there are circumstances that arise out of control to where true emergencies take presidence. Under these circumstances I do not think a two star review is warranted in this situation considering we gave you a free estimate, you called us back a couple weeks later after getting multiple other estimates from other companies to schedule a day for us to do the work at your home and we were unfortunately not able to get to it that day due to the circumstances listed above so we attempted to reschedule. The attempt was denied which resulted in us not performing any work at your residence. Again, we are so sorry if you were inconvenienced, we would love to speak with you more about this matter.

We complete this work and you were seemingly satisfied! You then informed us that your nearly 60 year old shower faucet was leaking so we agreed to attempt to fix it as after you denied the price quoted  to replace it 350$. We replaced all parts that are available for your particular faucet. Then on an additional visit in an attempt to try our best to ensure complete customer satisfaction we proceeded to replace the same parts again for free (we purchased the new parts and did not charge any labor and did not charge you for the purchase of the parts) because we thought they may have been defective. It ended up being that it was not defective parts,  the leak was due to it being an almost 60 year old shower faucet.   Our total cost in parts at this point is over $60 however we still honored the original price quoted and informed you that the you needed a new faucet that we would purchase and replace the old one with for $350 . You responded that the next homeowner would have to deal with that issue. You paid and we were on our way.

Two plumbers came out, climbed into my attic, blew in the pipe, told me they didn't have the tool for the job, said the pipe was clear, charged me $95, and left. They also gave me some line about how an AC unit isn't supposed to produce condensation, which 6th grade science would tell you is wrong: when you take humid, hot air and cool it, water must come out.\n\nThe next day we realized the AC had kicked off again and went up to find the pan full and the pipe not draining. My husband called the main number to complain and left his phone number, requesting a phone call, but the plumber called me back on my number. My husband spent ten minutes talking to the plumber, who insisted that the pipe was unclogged (despite the fact that we could see it was clogged and not draining). The plumber was pushy, interruptive, and in the end we wasted $95 to have two guys look around our attic and give us an uninformed opinion on our AC unit.

Worst experience I have ever had with a plumbing company.  I had a water leak in my under the concrete slab of my recently  purchased home.  When their plumber arrived, he recommended we call a leak detection company to locate exactly where the leak is and then have them come back for repairs.  I did this, located the leak and had a remediation company remove all my base cabinets exposing the concrete over the leak. I then called Drain Blaster.  Lady answering the phone ask my name, address, and ask me to describe the problem, told me someone would call me back and schedule time to come back.  Waited all day, no call, next day called again, same routine, my name, address, describe your problem, I'll have someone call you,  again, wait all day no one calls. Third day, call again, again same questions, name, address, problem, someone will call, by 2pm, no one calls.  I start to think that maybe its having to break up the concrete that is causing them to ignore me, so I went to Home Depot and rented a demolition hammer and chiseled and hammered out the concrete myself exposing the copper pipe and the leak.  I called Drain Blaster again, and as if I had never called, ask my name, address, etc.  I told the lady that I had removed the concrete and now only need a plumber to repair my leak.  She transferred me to the office manager, Again I explained the problem and that I had removed the concrete and that I now need a plumber. She said her husband was on his way to the office and she will let him know the situation. And let me say here, that I never raised my voice or got belligerent in any of my calls.  About an hour later I get call from the Home Warranty people saying that Drain Blaster just called them, not me, and told them they would not work on it because I had removed the concrete and they didn't want the liability.

I highly recommend their services and will request them again if i ever need any other plumbing services.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889048c1e86aeef:0x43af0240c7307ae8"}

Initially I was excited about how quickly they called to setup an appointment after receiving the work order. They arrived late the first appointment to repair a toilet that wouldn\u2019t flush (water swirling in the bowl, older toilet).\n\nThe guys augured the toilet and got the water to flush, albeit not strong, Said the warranty company would not replace the toilet and left. Quoted me $500 to replace. They also left a brown mess all over the toilet and white tile floor.\n\nA day later the toilet stopped flushing and nothing would go down. I submitted a request for a recall and they came out a day later (Monday). Again, late. Again, augured the toilet and it wouldn\u2019t flush. Removed the toilet to check for clogs, didn\u2019t see any. Augured it again. Spilled water everywhere. Reinstalled toilet, wouldn\u2019t work. Said it needed to be replaced. Called his supervisor and said it\u2019s not clogged and needed to be replaced. Told me they would call the warranty company and I would hear back the next day. Left a brown mess.\n\nI did not hear back from anyone. Friday came so I finally called, was told they were in the field and would call me in an hour and a half. No call back. At about 3pm I call and it went to voicemail after two rings. I left a message. No callback.\n\nMonday I call Old Republic who advised they will get a report from the service provider. Service provider apparently tells OR that there is a clog they cannot get to, so it\u2019s not covered under warranty. OR asks if it\u2019s sediment (which IS covered) and apparently they told her no. OR calls me back and says nothing they can do.\n\nI call a local OR rep and I\u2019m informed they will honor the warranty and for me to use a plumber of my choice. A day later a plumber comes in and immediately says there is no doubt it\u2019s not a clog, it\u2019s the jet that is the size of a pin hole due to rust and sediment. Didn\u2019t take anything more than looking at it to determine that (see attached picture).

After our discussion I took some pictures of the space and the old water heater and sent them to the office in an Email.\nThe next day Mark contacted me to inform me that he had found me a water heater and give me the cost for installation.  I approved the cost and asked when they could send someone out to install it.  I was very pleased when He informed me that they could do it that Friday at 8:00 am and quickly accepted the appointment.\nOn Friday Josh and Matt arrived promptly at 8 am! They did a quick review of the old tank turned off the water, shut off the power to the old tank and began the process of removing the old water tank.  They worked well together and where very efficient.  It took only about 2 1/2 hours for them to complete the installation, close up the wall and turn on the water and power.\nI plan to call them for any future plumbing issue I might have and will defiantly recommend them to friends and family.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892f8304731c33:0xfda814ee98f338f3"}

THINK TWICE BEFORE USING COLE PLUMBING!! Our hot water heater wouldnt heat; we had a plumber come to diagnose the problem. Prior to arrival, my husband called and specifically asked for the technician to call him before making any repairs. We were told that we could turn down the service and pay a $60 service fee or have them fix our hot water heater and pay for the services and have the service fee waived. After only 12 minutes, the plumber came out and said he fixed the hot water heater and that it would cost $194. All he did was reset a switch and clean the filter. After signing the invoice and paying for the service, I called my husband to make sure that the plumber called him before making repairs. My husband informed me that he received no such call. The plumber decided to fix the hot water heater without consulting with me or my husband first as to whether we wanted them to fix it or to seek service somewhere else. Carrol, who they described as a master plumber, never followed our specific instructions. We called the Cole Plumbing office and spoke to Jeanette a secretary who was extremely rude, and we asked that we could speak to Mr. Cole directly about the situation. We asked that they put our check on hold until we could get the issue resolved. After several days of not hearing from anyone, we called again. We were still unable to speak with anyone in charge and received a rude runaround from Jeannette the secretary. One month later, we received a letter from Chambless Math and Carr for a debt collection of $260.80, yet had still received no call from Cole Plumbing. I called again to see if I could speak face-to-face with Mr. Cole. James Cole said once they turn us over to the lawyer that it was out of their hands and it would be a waste of time to even come up there and see someone. No one would even hear my side of the situation. Overall, we spent $260 on a problem that would never have happened if they had followed their protocol and our specific instructions to inform us of the problems with the hot water before making any repairs. Cole Plumbing is an unprofessional and crooked company. I would not recommend their services to anyone not even my enemies. They never would hear us out and only took their plumber's word over ours.

{"user_id": "115504932104850664042", "name": "David Solomon", "time": 1482943464951, "rating": 1.0, "text": "For this review, I feel I must first present a little information up front.\nFor the last several months I have been having issues with the plumbing in my house.  My house was built in 2007 with PVC pipe throughout.  Let\u2019s just first say that after purchasing the home I later believed the plumbing was not installed to code, and first experienced several water leaks of which I fixed myself.\n\nSeveral months ago I hired a plumber to come in and resolve a hot water (lack of) issue.  The Hot water tank had made an awful screeching noise similar to what I have been hearing in my modern GE Refrigerator with a water filter. At the time the plumber removed a check valve on the water Heater which resolved my Hot water problem and the screeching noise.  No further investigation was conducted on why the Hot water heater started having issues and I believe that repair cost me around $100.00.\nSo in the last couple of months I have still have that screeching with my Refrigerator and the pipes had been banging whenever we flushed one of the toilets.  Upon doing some research to try and resolve the banging pipe issues I had come across an article on a thermal expansion tank upstream from the Hot Water Heater on the Cold water line.  I located mine under the house just as the main cold water line comes in the house. The tank has a valve in it and is supposed to give a cushion for the water when it expands.  I went to check the expansion tank and when I put on an air tester, water came out, which is an indication of a faulty tank.  I purchased a new one and left the air pressure at the manufacture default and installed it.  Now my pipes started banging worse and the tank started making a sucking sound. I further researched the issue and found an article that too much water pressure can wreak havoc on your water system so I went to Lowe\u2019s and picked up a cheap home water pressure gauge. I tested my system and found that my home was averaging around 130PSI. Based on this information resources indicated that a faulty Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) just up from the home water meter could be the culprit. I located mine by digging about a foot up from the local water meter and left it uncovered.\nIt was finally time for me to call a plumber as I am not one, and only completed the previous steps out of necessity.  I am a retired Enlisted Veteran and have not had a real job for six years and have been struggling to pay my bills.\n\nThe day before Christmas I called B & C Plumbing Inc. and left message on their phone system that I would be needing their services when they could work me in.  Tuesday after Christmas I received a courteous phone call from the B& C customer service and scheduled a Master Plumber to arrive at my home between 14:00 \u2013 16:00. Shortly after that Drew the Master Plumber called me from his cell phone and said he was on his way over because he had a cancellation and would come and resolve the issue.\n\nThis is where the negative experience starts.  Drew arrived at my front door knowing the information that I had already shared previously and I shared that information with him again on what my issue was going on under the house.  His first statement to me before looking at anything was that it was going to cost me $300.00. No indication of a discount for anything or because I was a Military Vet.  Now first off, I expected that he would be crawling under my home and fix some of the issues with the bagging pipes (Non-Code meeting).  He had no time to give me a run down on what the problem was nor what it the cost layout was to fix my issues.\n\nHe proceeded to place a water pressure gauge on the outside faucet and recorded that the PSI was 145. He then went to the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) and replaced it spending less than two hours of actual time far less work as much of the time was him on the Cell phone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487948819020, "text": "Mr. Solomon, in response to your review I would like to apologize for your unsatisfactory experience with our company.

After a year of begging Alms Pump to come reconnect the electric wires in the older pump house that they disconnected to put a check valve,  I had to hire an electrician ($126) to come restore electricity in the pump house so that the lights could be turned on for freezing weather that was 2 days after the 2 days of freezing weather.  The bulb receptacle that was removed without my permission was bought and remounted as the backup bulb.\nIt makes no sense to mistreat a customer who is a disabled Army Veteran and have been a loyal paying customer.\n\nBuyer beware\n\nAlms pump does not care about their customers.  You cannot trust them to do the job right especially if you leave them and trust that they will do right by you.   I paid $450 for a check valve but the aggravation they caused me for a year to reconnect the electric wires they disabled, removed a light bulb socket without my permission, and had leaking pipes at the new pump, I should charge them $500 or more.\n\nSo, buyer beware.\n*********************************\nNov 10, 2020 update:\nAlm Pump finally came to fix the leaking pipes..  Hurricane Sally busted the leaking pipes open and water was pumped on the grounds for 2 to 3 days and nights. It could have burned up the new pump. I wondered why there were 4 inches of water on the ground 3 days after the hurricane. Wading through the water, I discovered the pump gushing water from the pipe at the pump.  I shut off the power to the pump. Then called Alms Pump.\nTheir reply was that they had people without water and it would be a couple of days. Well, about 6 weeks later Alms Pump showed up and fixed the pipes to the pump and turned the water back on.  The bill for that meter where no water was used was $60.  This was the first bill where payment was only for water used plus taxes.\nAs to the older pump, Alms Pump  never went to the  pump house of the older pump and never reconnect the electric wires they disconnected to bring the pump and pipes out of the ground to put a new check valve on the pipe of the older pump.\nI have begged Alms Pump to reconnect the wires in the pump house so that the electric plugs can be used to run extension cord to where 2 junipers fell in the yard and need cutting.  To this day, Nov 10, 2020, the 2 juniper are still down.\nThere is no electricity to the switch for the light bulb when freezing weather comes.\n\nMy attorney wrote Alms Pump  a letter and it was ignored.  I gave Alms Pump until 31 Oct 2020 to reconnect the electric wires and that was ignored.\n\nThey will not answer as to why they will not reconnect the electric wires they disconnected.  I paid Alms Pump $450 for repairing the older pump (putting in a new check valve).\nIf I have to hire an electrician to reconnect the wires Alms Pump disconnected, would that make Alms Pumps liable for the payment? My attorney says yes, and, they should be taken to Small Claims Court.\n\nThe senior Alms who started Alms Pump never mistreated their customers as I have been grossly mistreated by this younger generation running Allms Pump.\n\nI will never call Alms Pump to put down another well and pump. Fini.\n\nPrevious post in Sep 2020:\nNot responding to fix the leaking T under the valve they installed.  I have done business with Alms Pump for over 30 years and do not understand why they are not responding to come fix their work. A plumber would not touch it.\n\nAlms Pump.

They quoted me the price before even diagnosing the issue, stating, \"we can make this stop dripping for $175\". It was a 20 minute repair job and it did not solve the problem - still leaked. I requested them to come back because it wasn't fixed and all they did was the exact same repair. This did nothing, and the faucet still leaks to this day. The plumbers were not professional, did not wear masks, and did not want to take the time to accurately diagnose and fix the issue. Instead, they looked for the easiest and quickest \"fix\".  I ended up having to call another plumber who was able to correctly diagnose and explain the problem to me. I might as well have thrown $225 in the trash.\n\nNot only did the plumber waste my money, but cost me HUNDREDS. During my initial request for service, I also requested that they re-install a center knob on a shower spa sprayer that came loose. It was installed a few years ago, and nothing technically was wrong with it - the center knob just needed to be re-installed. After taking apart the cover plate and fooling with it, they said it couldn't be fixed. They never diagnosed the issue or told me what was wrong with it, offering no solution. I hired a different plumber to look at it today and he said that the metal lip on the center valve is chipped and broken from someone trying to turn it excessively to remove it (it is one piece and can't be removed). It was installed a few years ago, and no one else has fooled with it except for them. So, they chipped it when fooling with it, which explains their reluctance to fix the problem. Now the entire unit has to be replaced, I have to cut a hole in my wall, and it is going to cost me hundreds of dollars. An honest or reliable plumber would have owned up to the mistake instead of trying to brush it off, and a knowledgeable one would have known better to begin with.\n\nI honestly never leave bad reviews.

We spent several hours working in and around your septic tank. Plumbing is often a process of elimination, and you understood that there was a good chance the pump may still need to be replaced, however since it was fully functional when we finished you wanted to hold off on the more costly replacement.

We had used John Wayne for several other repairs and never had an issue. When we needed help replacing our water filter they were the first company I called.  So we had the big blue filter that\u2019s shown in the picture below and our only issue was we couldn\u2019t get the housing off to replace the filter inside. We tried everything we could and then eventually cracked the housing so it needed to be replaced. I called John Wayne and said I have a big blue water filter and we need help getting it off so we can replace it. They said they\u2019d need to come out and take a look so I said ok. They came out and said they could get the new part in two days. I could order the same part on amazon and get it in a few days but I figured why not just have them order it and replace it so it all gets taken care of at once.  (also note that all of the water in our house runs through this filter so we had to turn off the water and turn it on sporadically to take showers/flush toilets etc and collect the leaking water in tubs). So I don\u2019t hear anything from them on the 2nd day, so I call and ask what\u2019s going on....\u201doh we\u2019ll call the supplier and find out\u201d. They call the supplier and they promise that it\u2019s \u201con the truck\u201d and will be here the next day. I don\u2019t hear anything the next day...so I call them again. \u201cOh let me call the supplier and find out what\u2019s going on\u201d. They call me back and say well I guess it wasn\u2019t in the truck yesterday but they promise it\u2019s there now and we\u2019ll have it tomorrow. Well you can guess what happens, I call them yet again the next day since I haven\u2019t heard from them and they still don\u2019t have the part. I call them again on Friday (note that this started on Monday and we\u2019re still without water) and they said they\u2019d call me back. I call again on Friday and get no answer. We had to leave to go out of town for the weekend and I\u2019m pretty PO\u2019d at this point so I just leave it for Monday. Monday I call them back and they say they\u2019ve finally got the part and they\u2019ll come out and install it. They send some guy out and he installs it while I\u2019m working at home. I take a look and notice that it\u2019s a completely different filter and now they\u2019re charging me for 2 service trips plus this new filter housing and filters. I pay the guy because he has nothing to do with my frustration with this company. I call the office and ask why I\u2019m being charged for a completely different filter that costs $400 (the one we had would\u2019ve cost $65 on amazon). And John Wayne tried to tell me that I told him it was a different filter. YOU HAD SOMEONE COME OUT AND LOOK AT THE FILTER BEFORE IT WAS ORDERED AND CHARGED ME A SERVICE FEE, HOW DID I TELL YOU IT WAS A DIFFERENT FILTER?? (He also asked why i don\u2019t just order it on amazon, and i said because you said it\u2019d be here in two days so i figured you knew what you were talking about) I was irate, this should\u2019ve cost $200 MAX and now I\u2019m having to pay $700.

Sostarted looking for a plumber. I found John Hearn Plumbing. They are open seven days a week and do not charge more for holidays. I gave them a call. They sent so meone out. The man looked at my water heater and gave me a price of $1100. I accepted it and told him to get started. He had a hard time getting someone to open up the place to get the heater. While he was waiting on them he left to go do work at Western Sizzlin. About two hours later he came back and left the heater on my carpool and went back to Western Sizzlin. Even though I was first I got pushed back for a higher paying job. He showed back up just before dark to put n this heater. He had to put it in by flashlight because at that time the light in the utility room was blown. When he took it out of the box it was broken. He fixed it an made a notation on my invoice. So I just paid $1100 fo a brand new broken heater. When he got done that night there was still water on the floor. Could not tell at that time for there was a leak or not.  A couple of days later called them back out because there was a puddle on my carport. The same guy came out in the dark again to find a leak. He looked at the heater and sad it was not it. He looked around and decided that it was my washing machine leaking and charged me another $125. I bought a new washer and hoses and had it installed. There has been water on the floor of the utility room ever since. Monday June 17 the leak that the sad I did not have finally got bg enough that I could see it. So around 3pm I called them. They said that they would send someone out the next day and would call me before hand to let me know. At five thirty Tuesday June18th I called them back to see why I had not heard anything. They acted like I hadn't called. Someone showed up at 8:30pm and sad that the leak is on the copper pipe and s not part of the water heater and would cost me $95. I sad let me get this straight I paid $1100 for a broken heater the a couple of days later paid $125 to have him come out to fix a leak that he could not find and now you want me to pay another $95 to fix the that should have been fixed the day the heater was put in?

He also replaced a broken shut off valve in the kitchen and changed the old shut off valves underneath the new vanity to quarter turn valves.

They never charged additional service charges (parts excluded) and really worked to make things right.

So being a Very Old home setting back off the road it took a lot of ditch digging for new service from road and All new Pex lines in the home. Absolutely no issues until recently only to find out the company that produced the Pex sold faulty piping nationwide. So about 6 months back we found water pouring thru the outside rim of the house so I called Ted and they sent 2 young men out. Well it took quite a few trips inside and out and finally finding a hidden pin hole leak on the Pex pipe on back side of hot water heater.so replaced the bad section but my first warning about pipe issue. so a few days ago another leak spotted outside house and this time Pex line pin hole leak under the home ,repaired but again  a young man just wonderful attitude . So the following day yet another pin hole leak but again inside on Hot water heater in pipe not previously repaired so this time all the OLD Pex inside hot water area gone and replaced with Grade A Pex  thru floor to crawl space . These young men that decided to work for Ted are all very nice respectful,helpful, and just damn happy to see some young people that want to do work that most don't.

They then proceeded to charge me 225.00 for the time spent on the initial problem which they did not fix, supposedly dropped from 265.00 because they did not fix it. They did install a new flush mechanism in the toilet tank. It did not work. When I called &talked to Ted, he was rude & ugly to me. He said \"I will not work on your plumbing until you install a new pressure regulator\". He did send the same guys back the following day & they replaced  the flush mechanism.  They had a written statement from Ted for me to sign that they wd not be back until I replaced the pressure regulator. I will never call another plumber unless they are trained, licensed & can show me proof of those things & a written estimate. Don't be fooled like I was. These guys quote prices off the top of their heads.

A price was give by this vendor to put in a Sanitary T and unclog the drain. Our time window was 12 to 5, they called and asked if they could come in the evening.  We agreed.  Their Power Snake did not work correctly leading to them unwinding the unit in the Common Area Hallway for an hour.  The Sanitary T did not fix the issue. I asked if I would be charged and the tech confirmed I would not be for that second visit.  I was told they would have to cut a hole in the wall of my hallway to gain access to the pipe in question.  An access panel would have to be installed.  This would cost me in excess of $1,200.00 but they had to get the full price from their boss.  I would be called back on Friday.  No call Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  I hired another plumber at my expense for a second opinion.  They fixed the issue in 2.5 hours.  If this company would have put an access panel and cut the hallway wall, there would have been no pipe to fix.  It was behind the sink where the clog was.  My issue was a misdiagnosis that could have cost me time, holes in my wall, money and aggravation. When you use a Home Warranty company, this kind of think happens.  The \"A\" team is not sent out.

My problem with them had to do with my home warranty. The biggest part of the repair was not covered by my warranty and I knew that I would have to pay.

The pipes used were too small and not properly routed to facilitate adequate draining of the water. This repair is a covered repair under my contract and I printed a copy of the contract to show the technician. After the work was complete the technician said that he had tried to call the warranty company, but he was not able to talk to anyone. He advised me that if I paid the total amount that he would get the warranty part sorted out the next day and the company would reimburse me what was owed for covered repairs. I gave them two days and then I called the warranty company, their response was that no one had contacted them. I reached out to the manager of Draingo and he said that he would have the tech call in. When they did finally call in they called in with the wrong explanation of repairs and the warranty company would not pay for what they provided as the diagnosis. When I tried to call back to talk to Jason (manager?) he would not return my messages. I finally texted him and he replied that he was not going to give them \"false information\" just so my claim would be covered. I told him that all I wanted was for them to give the correct explanation, not a false one. Needless to say I got no where.

The plumber showed me several places where large tangles of roots had grown through the old clay pipe and totally blocked the system and could not be reamed out. The sewer line was installed accurately, but because I live on a very steep lot with lots of rock in the soil, the job was difficult, even with a tractor digging the trench and covering back the trench. The plumber left a huge mess in the yard, did not attempt to finishing grading the pile of dirt that  had developed at the bottom of the hill. It overflowed past the gutter and into the street. It's as if he tried to smooth out the worst of it and then just gave up and left it there, all mounded up. Also he didn't arrive until late in the afternoon with the tractor to cover the trench, and then ran out of time and incentive to finish the job properly. He said he was going to drive the tractor on the trailer back to Decatur that evening. Every time the tractor was needed it had to come from Decatur, which slowed down the work. As a result of the mess he left, I've had to hire a contractor to grade the dirt on the hill with a tractor and then replace the cement steps that had to be removed to get to the sewer line. The steps that were not removed have to be replaced also because the plumber's tractor broke off corners and gouged them badly. The price DrainGo quoted me before beginning was fair, but what an ordeal this has been trying to repair the damage caused by this sewer work. DrainGo should have done a much better joy smoothing out my yard before they called it quits on the job. Someone at the company should equip them with a wheel barrow too.

We were told to keep flushing it and it might fix itself. ( it did not). I had them come out a second time. this time they said that the system needed to have a camera look through the pipes. This is not covered by my home warranty and also Drain go doesn't perform that service. I called the warranty company to confirm. I have to call a qualified plumber to come out to diagnos my problem and then have them tell Drain Go how to fix it. They also looked at my water heater and found that it needed to be replaced. Drain Go ordered a tall 50 gal water heater instead of the short water heater. So I had to have the shelves in the utility removed for it to fit. If you have a choice I do not recommend the services of Drain Go. If you have a home warranty you will not have a choice.

This company was contracted to our home with our home warranty.  This company was hired to locate a leak in our basement, my husband told the \u201cplumber\u201d where he thought it was coming from(washer connector) in laundry room, bc there was a small drip of water on pipes. This man took a look at the dripping pipe downstairs , walked upstairs looked at wall in laundry then said he would have to cut a hole in our wall, cut a hole then said he couldn\u2019t determine leak and would have to send a crew the following week to use a camera to find that way. All the while he was on the phone with someone asking what he should do/look at, we had no confidence this man even knew what he was looking for. The next day I receive a call from home warranty stating this company has determined the leak source as a pre-existing condition and would not be covered on the warranty. This was concerning to us because, firstly when the man left no source was determined which is exactly why he was sending a crew out the following week to further investigate. We found it odd that we were told when he left he couldn\u2019t find the source but warranty company was told one thing so it wouldn\u2019t be covered. When I spoke to warranty company they determined that the \u201cpre-existing\u201d claim was false based on the written findings that clearly stated no source was found. Warranty company attempted to even contact Draingo with no avail. I cancelled any further contact with Draingo and hired my own trusted plumbing company. Who by the way took one look at washer box and knew exactly what was wrong and fixed within minutes. No need to cut holes in wall or camera... from other reviews and my experience I believe this company esp. when they find out it\u2019s associated with a home warranty will claim \u201cpre-existing\u201d to get more money from you.

So I decided to TRY and do the sink replacement myself; I had atleast some knowledge enough to replace a sink, but I found yet another problem... The water valves under the sink has sceed so I couldn't turn off either one; at that point I decided to call Drain Go directly and see if they would install the sink and new valves, and not only did they agree but they agreed to do it on a weekend which is when they're closed and reserved for emergencies. So our service guy Matthew Jones showed up; took a look at the issues I wanted fixed, and set right to work. Maybe three hours later (the new sink wasn't a exact copy of the old so there was some adjustments) he had it all set in and connected; he had looking like the new sink had already been there, and that's what you call professional! I hope Drain Go doesn't mind me saying this but I really wanted to tip Matthew; we did tip him $8 when I really wanted to give him $10, but I only card my debit card on me and my wife only had $8 bucks on her.

I was having an issue with very low water pressure/water flow throughout my entire house.

They were able to remove and replace the damaged section. It was only through the persistence and perseverance of the two technicians that they were able to locate the problem.\nIn addition to repairing the damaged pipe to correct water flow they also installed a booster pump to increase my water pressure. Jason and Alex worked tirelessly all day until 8:30 at night to insure the job was completed properly and there were no unresolved issues. I now have fantastic water pressure and water flow and for exactly the cost that was quoted to me originally.\nThe men showed up on time, were very courteous and concerned with my satisfaction.
