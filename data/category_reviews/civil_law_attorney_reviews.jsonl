I knew that John was the one I wanted in my corner after watching his videos and didn't hesitate to reach out to him about my case.\n\nHe and Carolyn were very polite and respectful to me. The consultation with John left me with no doubt that I would hire him for this. It was evident on the phone, as in his videos, that he knows his stuff. Immediately after speaking with him over the phone I felt absolutely sure that if anyone could win my case it would be him.\n\nAfter hiring him it was very simple. I didn't have to drive to meet him anywhere or go out of my way for meetings. Everything was done electronically with him and his office which made the process very easy. Any questions I had were answered with either a phone call or email. Simple.\n\nI am glad and relieved to report that he indeed resolved my case! If you are fortunate enough to have found John, do not hesitate to contact him and do not waste precious time reaching out to other law firms in Alabama who probably aren't interested in taking your case anyway.\n\nThanks John and Carolyn!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b91690004ef:0x82b36df943c7bdf8"}

However, I did feel like I had some kind of legal rights and taking no action at all was not an option for me.  I felt like I had to fight back in some type of way and not let these people (the plaintiff) unjustly take my hard earned money.  Therefore, I began to do some online research to find out how I could combat this legally.  I came across the Watts & Herring, LLC Law Firm.  I liked the information that they displayed on their website and they seemed very experienced and knowledgeable of consumer rights.  I decided to give them a call and I initially spoke with Ms. Carolyn Allcorn and she was very courteous and understanding of my situation.  She got me in touch with one of the attorneys, Mr. John Watts, who has been nothing short of helpful, knowledgeable, experienced and he keeps me up to date on things every step of the way.  Needless to say, I have no regrets of choosing Watts & Herring, LLC as my attorney.  I am grateful to have found them and my journey with them has been very satisfactory and pleasant.

Watts explains the processes and gives you key things to look out for so that you won't be overwhelmed with the process.\n\nFILE A RESPONSE TO THE LAWSUIT AND SHOW UP TO COURT! (best advice ever!)\n\nI followed the instructions--- answer the summons, show up to court and be prepared with a definitive response to the claim of debt.  I did all of that and the Judge informed the lawyer that I denied owing the debt and now she has to fulfill my Request for Production.  The lawyer stated that it was my debt because she had credit card statements.  The Judge replied, \"we live in a day of identity theft and the defendant has requested that you produce a signed agreement between her and Midland Funding ---can you produce it\".  The lawyer responded that she believed that she could produce the information.  Judge gave us 60 days to return back before him.\n\nThe lawyer asked if she could speak with me in the hallway and the judge suggested that I see what she had to say.  She asked me did I not received the credit card statements that were sent to me.  I stated, \"I repeat my answer from court --- I have received everything that your office submitted to circuit court\".  She replied, than you have everything (I remembered Atty. Watts mentioning to be cautious in your response to the lawyer because they can flip it back on you).  I reminded her that the judge asked her office to fulfill my Request for Production and she said that I will have everything in 30 days.\n\nSo I will await whatever further documentation that Midland Funding can produce.  What's amazing is that Midland Funding is projected to be removed from my credit report September 2018.  I cross referenced that with all three credit bureaus and they all notate September 2018.\n\nAtty.

Reluctantly she gave and realized she had just been served papers.  She immediately went in a total panic attack.  Thank God my older children were home at the time.  My wife, being a former paralegal, called around to friends who all refused to help us.  Due to circumstances beyond our control 4 years before, we lost our vehicle due to a job change for me that proved disastrous.  It was a very dark time for us, but we managed to pull ourselves up from it and found good jobs, we even bought a house.   We didn\u2019t hear anything regarding the vehicle for years.  Then we got a letter that an attorney had the old \u201caccount\u201d.  Then we got served 2 weeks later.  We thought we going to lose everything again and that process was inconceivable.  Being desperate, my wife looked on the internet and found Watts and Herring.  The testimonials were unbelievable.  The videos on their site only made us feel even more like someone cared and help was attainable.  We filled out the online contact form and within 24 hours we were contacted.  The attorney we spoke with was so understanding and comforting regarding our issue.  We felt we could breathe again and that things would be ok.  We had prayed for God to lead us to a strong tower, and we found it in Watts and Herring.  They were so kind and understanding and were able to settle our case in a matter of days.

Well, that happened to me but the hard times wouldn't go away! After a year of unemployment and having a baby, I fell behind on a few bills. Finally, caught a break and landed a wonderful job! Immediately after receiving my first paycheck I began calling creditors to \"do the right thing\" I had no clue that I was actually waking a sleeping dragon!\nAfter a year in the nightmare with creditors, I felt bankruptcy was my only option. I had hired a credit counseling service, who took my money and ran. I hired a credit clean up service, who took my money and ran. The same story repeated itself over and over. Creditors were suing me, my life Was imploding and I feared I was about to lose everything! Finally, while googling bankruptcy laws, I somehow stumbled on the name John Watts and thought, what do I have to loose? I gave it one last stitch effort. I was amazed at the amount of advice he gave! He really seemed to care! He spent ample time helping me to understand my situation and gave me several options, bankruptcy was not one of them! He even sent a packet full of information! He felt like he could make an impact on my situation and that he did! One of my  creditors was American Express. They are no longer a creditor because the debt was cancelled and is to be erased from my credit report!!! John Watts was able to accomplish this without having to step foot in the court room! One case down and one to go! I am incredibly thankful to have found John Watts! Has been so very kind and generous and has given me the peace of mind I need! It gives me hope that my credit will be back in shape soon and I won't have the cloud of bankruptcy looming over my head! If you are facing a challenging situation, I urge you to give him a call!

For me, it was $300 lower than the alleged debt..but with their fees I would be paying only $50 less than what I was being sued for. After a few calls to them, something was fishy. They never answered any of my questions and I spoke to multiple different people who kept telling me different things. I was not confident with hiring them. At this point I had only a few more days to respond to my summons before a default judgement was placed against me. My anxiety was through the roof. I did more extensive research and came across Watts & Herring. The videos on his website were so helpful, I called immediately. Caroline answered my call and she was so comforting..I laid it all out on the table; my problem and how fearful I was. She reassured me that Mr.John Watts could help. And he did! Not only did he give me the best possible choice, he taught me a lot! He was always a text, call, or email away. He solved my debt with this nasty debt collector better than I even expected! My total cost spent was far less than I would have guessed when I first started this process. My only regret is that I let myself worry and stress too long...I should have called the minute I found out. John is a life saver and made what could have been a very bad experience into a great one! My advise- do not make any decisions into solving your debt until you speak to John. He is an amazing and genuine person. Highly recommend this wonderful man and his office!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b91690004ef:0x82b36df943c7bdf8"}

I did a little research and came across John's website. From the first point of contact, he and his assistant, Carolyn, were extremely professional. They were very patient when answering all of my questions and made sure I understood my options clearly. I decided to represent myself in court and John walked me through the process, step by step. Thanks to his help, and maybe a little luck, the judge ruled in my favor. I didn't owe the money! Not only that, we turned around and sued Unifund and instead of going to court, they settled for $5,000. (They are apparently a shady company, so DO NOT automatically pay them!! Call John!) So thanks to John Watts, I ended up making money instead of having to pay it. How crazy is that?!

We were so upset and didn't know where to turn. We had only 14 days to file an answer to the complaint or the plaintiff would get a default judgment. I started searching on the web of how to answer the complaint, but had no idea how we were going to fight this! I didn't know where to even begin!\nThen, I came across Watts & Herring, Consumer Protection Attorneys website and blog and started reading and watching videos that John Watts had posted. I started feeling much more at ease and decided we would try to fight this.\nWell, before I had even submitted an answer to the complaint, a process server came again and my husband was being sued for a SECOND lawsuit by the SAME \"infamous\" DEBT COLLECTOR!! Now we had TWO answers to file. I felt a bit overwhelmed, but felt like I could tackle this. We WERE NOT going to let them win by a default judgment!\nI turned in the answers and got notice of court dates. The court dates were exactly a week apart!\nI did a lot of research and felt VERY confident on our day in court. I did have some concerns in facing a judge and not knowing what questions may be asked by the plaintiff. However, I came prepared to court, and after speaking with the attorney for the plaintiff for awhile and questioning everything that was his \"evidence\", he caved. We WON lawsuit number one!\nThe very next week we went to court for the second lawsuit, very confidently, with our heads held high, and lo and behold...the same attorney was representing the plaintiff! Again, he caved. So, WE WON AGAIN!! We had been sued TWICE by the same \"infamous\" debt collector and BEAT THEM both times!\nWell, I had sent an email to John Watts of Watts & Herring to let him know about our success and to thank him for all of the wonderful information on his website. He congratulated us and suggested we sue the debt collector back in Federal Court. WOW! I had no idea that was an option!\nEven though we succeeded in our county small claims court twice on our own, I knew we would need the expertise of John Watts for the Federal Lawsuits; there's no way we could do that on our own.\nJohn explained our options and was very attentive with any of our concerns. He represented us in filing TWO Federal Court Cases against the debt collector that had no right to sue us.\nThe process went very smoothly for us. John or the knowledgeable staff at Watts & Herring kept us updated regularly throughout the whole process of any kind of progress being made on the lawsuits, and that put my mind at ease instead of worrying and feeling overwhelmed.\nBoth Federal Court Cases resulted in settlements that we were very pleased with. We could not have been any happier. We truly would like to thank John Watts and the staff of Watts & Herring! We could not have fought those battles alone!\nSo, for any of you reading this, if you're sued by a debt collector, I highly recommend Watts & Herring! Be SURE to answer any lawsuit within the deadline and do not let them win a default judgement! Try not to be overwhelmed, intimidated, or let it stress you out or give you anxiety. Seek the advice of Watts & Herring. They are very friendly and knowledgable folks and can explain your options. I know you will be pleased!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b91690004ef:0x82b36df943c7bdf8"}

When I first received those papers of being sued and possibly having my wages garnished I felt helpless. That made me depressed and hopeless  I wasn't able to sleep or eat for a couple of days. It seemed unfair that my credit and my income were constantly taking hits and there wasn't any room to breathe or get ahead. Then I started to look for help and come to find that there aren't many lawyers that are willing to help and support you during those times. Fortunately in one of the oddest places I found a person who would teach me a lot that was Google and YouTube. First I was able to find Randi on Google and she enlightened me on many aspects of how these things go then she sent me links to helpful information that led me to John and YouTube. The videos were a breath of fresh air! Finally someone who is interested in educating others as well as putting actions with it. Randi connected us and there wasn't any delay in him reaching out to me and putting the situation in terms that I could understand and making me sure that there are options. Many people don't get the chance to have options when dealing with legal issues and I am glad that there are lawyers out there that will inform as well as help you to stand up to poor collection practices and tactics. I wish that they had a larger platform to reach many others like myself whom otherwise would have to take being mistreated by the collections system. I feel if all lawyers could be like this then people would have less disappointment with the legal system, from start to finish his whole team treated me like a person and kept me informed as to what was going on with my case and made me a part of what was going on. One of the most satisfying things about this whole process was to deal with someone who when they said something they meant and did it.

I have to admitt that I immediately went into a panicked. Although it was after 6 pm on a Friday evening, I grabbed the telephone and began to call the list of Attorney's I had Googled. My stress level shot up and I thought about taking the pills that my Doctor recomended to calm my nerves a few weeks ago, but I discovered that I had ran out. \u00a0What I did do, was make sure that I had taken my blood pressure meds. for that day. Thereafter, the entire weekend was a blur. \u00a0I could not get my mind from focusing on being sued.\n\nMonday morning rolled around and we figured that perhaps we can try to work this out without legal counsel. I then called the number on the paperwork. The person on the other end (whom I thought represented the TJMAXX Co.)convinced me that I would be out of this mess if I paid them a lump sum or payed a sum monthly for 2 years, and signed a Concent Judgement Form. That was a chance I welcomed if it meant that we would be out from under this pressure. We considered selling my Husband's vehicle to do the settlement but decided against it( his car isn't worth much anyway). Instead, I made the first monthly payment which was money set aside for my 14 year old daughter's Curriculumn for that year. We felt uneasy about the Consent Judgement Form after we did some research on it. My Husband and I placed a stop on the check , but the bank said it had already been processed. We then decided that we will seek legal counsel because clearly, we needed it!\n\nTuesday morning I got a call from Mr. Watts's Secretary, Carolyn. Just speaking with her, \u00a0made me feel less anxious, but I was still not completely settled. The following day My Husband and I spoke with Mr. Watts. He took his time and explained the situation and our options. All of our questions were answered and we ended the call with the feeling of having had a black cloud literally lifted from over our heads! Although we are aware that the process is in its infancy, our anxiety level has greatly diminished!\n\nFast Foward to October 8, 2016:\nAround 8:45 that morning we got an email from Mr. Watts stating that we won our case! We were so grateful to God and Mr.Watts and his Staff!
