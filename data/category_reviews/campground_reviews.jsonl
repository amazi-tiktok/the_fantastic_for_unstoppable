The so called owner (Chad) is arrogant and extremely poor at business I don't know how he runs a lawn care and this business because he has no business smarts. The RV Park is Rundown and if you are late on rent he will shut your power off and if you don't pay it he will hook to your camper or whatever you have parked there and repo it. He will not give you anything in writing as to when your rent is due when it is considered late or how much a late fee is. He charges different prices of late fees on different days for different people. He has repoed three different campers while I was staying there and he cut power off to these one day past being late. Legally he is supposed to give you something in writing to let you know what your responsibilities are and what his are. No one will stand up to him or for their rights. He has Semmes Towing come and repo your camper and he won't let you have it back unless you have all kind of paperwork for it and he charges $75 a day that you don't get it knowing that he makes it impossible for you to get it back. The power source there is not sufficient it is not wired correctly everyone that has stayed there it has blown their TVs it blowed my TV my refrigerator and any other major appliance that I had. It is not up to standards and he will not do anything about it. So if you are looking for a place to stay that is not up to standards and you want to be talked to like a dog or like you're ignorant and have your home repoed if you are late on your rent or have your power cut off being late for rent which he didn't tell you when rent is due or how much late fee is. This place should be shut down and it is considerably illegal. One of the gentlemen that was staying there got in a bind and he was late on his rent and he is on disability and he got his camper repossessed and was told to get out within 24 hours and he is now sleeping on the road and the Walmart parking center anywhere he can lay his head because his camper got repoed for being late.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bacf930b905d5:0xb542777f94101059"}

It has been the most unique place we\u2019ve stayed thus far. It\u2019s a cross between an antique store and an outdoor wonderland...two of our favorite things to do! The owner (Mark) took us on a private tour of his antique collection that he has been working on for years. It was absolutely amazing! He was 100% accepting our furrbabies and considered them as family members. Swimming hole and bike trails onsite looked like a blast but we only stayed for a night so didn\u2019t have much time to explore.

Amazing family who owns this place and turned it into something really special! As you enter the best kept secret in America you at first see a small Mom and Pop store.

If antiques are your \"thang\" then this is where ya wanna be. Not just the entire general store inside but the entire outside of the general store as well! And it doesn't stop there. As you walk the large porch attached, your eyes are darting this way and that at all the history of the past that some of us maybe saw in Grandma's kitchen or in Grandpa's garage. As you come out from under the covered porch and the sun hits your eyes, your taken back by what you see next. It's got a small make-shift town right out of the Twilight Zone. Even real people are living in two of the homes so please be respectful of their privacy. Around back of the town is a campground that's perfect size. Not too big, not too small. Just right to get to know your neighbors and have privacy. There's a tire swing, which Rob convinced me to go on, but truthfully I was going to anyway. Haha A playground like we had when we were kids, so make sure you supply the kids with towels for their legs cause it'll be hot, or just do what I did and let them experience real life. Haha\nAlso, there's a house boat there that adds character to the campground, {make sure you read what's written on it. Haha} Now for the main attraction,....it's a beautiful, peaceful, stream that digs up childhood imagination and feelings of the past for everyone of us. No amount of words or pictures can do justice.

We camped outside in a nice, clean area with immediate access to showers, bathrooms, pavilion, and some deluxe propane cooking grills. He also allowed us to fish his catfish ponds and we caught several 2-4 pounders all day. That evening we enjoyed the night sky in the darkness a New Moon provides, with breathtaking views. The next morning we loaded up, cooked breakfast, and listened to Mr. Ken's presentation before going down to the creek to pick up fossilized shark teeth.

In short, a couple moved in wanting our spot. They kept calling the owners on us with untruthful accusations. The wife kept talking to me one morning while I was trying to load my car for work. I asked her to please just leave me alone. She would not stop. I just kept loading my stuff and asked again to leave me alone. The next day I get a call from Mindy, the owner while at work and she let's in on me with several slanderous accusations. She tells me my dog must be removed from the property by that night and if we do not comply, she will call the sheriff. Not once did she ever discuss anything with me prior to this day. I tell you Mindy is the most unprofessional person I have ever met. Talk about accused, charged and found guilty without a trial. We never had words with anyone or were ever warned by the owners. I assure you, the ones who did what we were accused of is still there!!!! My husband did have a civil conversation two days before with the owner's husband and thought they had an understanding. ????I must take this moment to thank Mindy because I did not like her from the first time I met her. We LOVE our new home. We have LOTS of water pressure!!!! I mean my Dawn makes bubbles in the sink!!!! FREE WI-FI!!!!!!! Mindy advertises free wi-fi.  What a joke. We have a foot more room inside our motorcoach. The power was so low there we couldn't get them to slide completely out!! Every time I cooked there I flipped a breaker. We can use all my appliances at one time now!!!! We have grass and a picnic table. Clyde, our service dog, is welcome and has a huge field he can run in. The owners are so kind and welcoming. Our first night here in our new rv park  the owner said they close at six but come on back, he'd be drinking a beer on the front porch and so we joined him!!! The good lord has blessed us with some great friends from Kick Back and I hope we never lose touch. Thank those who loved and accepted us and Clyde. We will never forget your blessings on us.\n\nI failed to mention the owner, Mindy showed up on our lot as soon as my husband got home from work (the same day i received a call at work from Mindy with her accusations)with the park manager and the security  guard carrying an assault rifle!!!!! Really???!  OMG!! We basically kept to ourselves but welcomed anyone that stopped by. We never were even talked to before this day!!!! Just can't wrap my head around such cruel and ridiculous tactics from Mindy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e7793b963da5d:0x3f94953604ba91fa"}

I was told to pick any spot I wanted and to come see them the next day. When we found our spot we backed our 40\u2019 fifth wheel in and was happy to see the spots were very level ! The next day after work I went to pay for our week here and met \u201cJoe\u201d the owner of the park , he was so kind and friendly and told us if there was anything we needed to let him know and he would do what he could to make it happen. So after a few days here I noticed the sewer hookup was above our sewer hose and sewer hose supports, after telling Joe within a week his son had came and fixed every sewer hookup at the park! I was originally only staying a week but after meeting Joe and his sons Chris and Wes and feeling so at home I have been here a month, &  hate that we have to leave for another job.\nIt\u2019s a brand new Rv Park with full hookups and really good WiFi that hasn\u2019t lagged or buffered once!

The only day they do not work is Sunday. (Yeh peace & quiet for one day).\nTo bad because if a small park & fishing is for you this would be perfect.  If you like to get up at 5:30 & will be gone all day I guess this would be for you.\nAlso you would think the price would be lower than the other nicer RV parks but it is not.

We moved into the RV fulltime in June 2019.\nWe are currently in this campground and will be leaving Friday May 1st,2020. Moved camper here to work at GP plant that's less than 2 miles away. And just found out we need to move to Chickasaw for another job.\nLaundry is nice. Campground was just sold so we didn't meet the new owners. Previous owner is very sweet. I'm not sure what the new owners will do but currently there is no one here to pay. She runs a place of business a few miles down the road and comes in the afternoon to get payment after you setup. Park is very clean. Had some issues with ants but its been raining a lot so that's understandable. The line of sites where we got on aren't really level but we picked it because its closest to the woods and away from most campers.

As soon as I got there The owners made me feel very welcome. Gregg made sure I had a really good spot to set up my tent. After I got all settled in, I walked up the club house and was introduced to some of the other campers. No one was rude, or made me feel like i was a outsider. Everyone at the camp group visitor and owners alike made me feel like for the first time in my life I could be myself and have fun.\nThe weather was wonderful as well, even though the first day was rainy it was still very pleasant and the rain helped you sleep well. The sun  and the breezes made beginning and the pool just the place to go. If you didn't want to be by the pool you could sit ob the deck  and just chill out. I opted for beginning pool side and had a great time even though i got myself sun burned. NO amount of spf can help if you sit out in the sun to long. The pool its self was great. I had never been in  salt water pool and I loved it. It was just cool enough to help against the heat but warm enough to enjoy it  anytime day or night.\nThe location was awesome, i need to get some things from the little of Columbia  AL near buy and it was very nice . The people and shop owners were all very  friendly.  They told me about different things in the area and where honestly nice. I couldn't find a fake smile from a single one. I even heard a couple of good jokes from one of the ladies from the gas station i visited . It isn't far from the Florida state line and only a couple of hours from Panama city and the beach which was great fun even in the off time i was there. I got a couple of eye sore shirts and enjoyed the beach to some degree.\nBut there was a couple of a draw backs to my time there. One my cell phone didn't really work at the camp site (Thanks t-mobile I will be dropping you as soon as I can!). The supervisor cats really didn't seem to like dog guest  the much.

My husband had to beg for the WiFi password they advertise as free with moving in, even when we got the password  we only had a small WiFi signal half of the day while the landlord lives it up on the same WiFi.

They have a very nice clean pool which my daughter and I took advantage of.  She's also played with all the children that were here. Needless to say she had a good time playing on the playground and with the other children. Laundry and bath house are clean. About 8 Dollars to wash 3 loads of clothes and dry them. Not bad.  Once again this is a RV park not a resort. People live here. They do have trailers to rent they are dateded.  They have full hookup cable lots of channels. Lots. Disney jr. Football anything you might want to watch.  They are making improvements. Covered concrete slab to park your fifth wheel or diesel pusher. Bus. Or camper. All in all this place was a great place to stay. People are friendly and helpful. My husband, daughter and I will stay here again if we are ever in the area. Also. This RV park is in the middle of everything . The uss Alabama is not far and dauphin park is close also the gulf coast.

When you first go in the woman at the desk named jill will try to act really nice and friendly, but she is really not!!! We stayed there for a few days and we got such a weird feeling staying there that we decided to leave and we had already paid them up for a month. We went and told them we wanted to leave that we need our money back and she kept saying she would have to talk to the owner to come back the next day so we did and she kept saying she couldnt get ahold of him and she doesnt have the key to the safe. So she told us to come back the next morning and still she couldnt get ahold of the owner then she ended up getting ahold of him and she started telling my husband that they could give us our money back and that my husband had agreed on $350 and my husband said no i never agreed to that she said yes you did i have it on camera where you did my husband said well roll the tapes back then i wanna see it and of course she didnt do it ! Anyways somehow she still couldnt get the money because the owner couldnt come again to meet us til like the next week i think it was and my husband explained to her that we cant do that that we needed our money back so we could get back home that was a 10 hr drive and that we had no place to go and she said i will go ahead and let you stay a week for free i know the manager will get mad but im gonna do it! Well the manager ended up comin by our camper on a four wheeler and told us to be up there a little bit before the week was over and we would work something out and my husband said ok. Well we went to the office and still he wasnt there to meet us the woman called him texted him... He still wouldnt come to the office to meet so we could talk to him and finally told the woman to get the money out of the safe, but all she gave us was like $300 and said she would send us $50 in the mail and my husband and i told her no that isnt right you owe us like $580 then she said well he says thats what he owes u my husband said no it is more than that we figured it all up on a calculator right in front of her and she said ill tell u what i will give u the $300 now then send you the rest in the mail even if he dissagrees i will get it out of the safe myself and send it to you so we went ahead and agreed cause we were tired of arguing knowing that we are more than likely going to get ripped off but we were so ready to get home that we just did it. Anyways we get home and call her at the time she told us to and of course jill told us oh i wont be able to give u the $50( she owed us like $280 not $50) because we didnt clean the camper before we left which we did she said that is a $40 fee and we had forgot to give them the key before we left so that was a $10 fee and might i add she was laughing as she told my husband this! So my husband told her she would be hearing from our lawyer and hung up the phone. Oh and one more thing i want to add the second time my husband went to the office to try to get the money back he went by hiself and she went off on him when he asked about the money started hollering and screaming at him my husband said mam i am not raising my voice or nothing i am talking ti you calmly and you are being very rude i just want my money back! My husband ended up just walking out and came back to the camper where i was. And the woman acts like she is under the influence of some kind of speed she talks jerks around really fast! Just take this as a warning do not go here! We never got all of our money back we could take them to court, but would cost more money in the long run since we live 10 hrs away!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb54edbdce72b:0x897f8ae94b2aed16"}

That would have saved us a wasted 23 mile trip both ways. Waterloo is a beautiful place, but I would rather stay on the free TVA land than at this so-called campground. The campground is actually a trailer park with some spots for camping. We stay in many campgrounds, some better than others, but this is the first time we have driven through a campground and left. I could not even find the camp office to begin with and everybody at the trailer park was staring us down when we drove through.\n\nWhen I couldn't find the office, I called the owner back to tell her we had changed our minds. She did not answer her phone. I got a phone call later on from a different number and it was the owner. I let her know that her park was not what we expected and that we had changed our minds.

Our property is 2 businesses, a small campground on the water with bathhouse, boat launch, fishing dock. The main portion are Lake lots that we lease yearly for vacation sites. It's not unusual for people to turn in the wrong drive; I keep meaning to get new signs but since my husband died in March I've been trying to juggle the whole thing alone. After we spoke, I did see that you had called the office number, which is supposed to be transferred to my cell phone. So I called you at 6:10 and we both missed each other. I apologize for my shortness, I have no excuse for that except that 14 hour days, 7 days a week sometimes gets me overwhelmed.   I'm usually pretty nice.  Our campground is usually not full in the fall, and the weather is perfect for camping.

And we did enjoy the company and festivities.  We paid extra for garage experience and it was worth it.  But the food and drinks in the stands could only be described as a rip off to the extreme, and the fact that you had to walk miles to get in was a disgrace.\nOnce locked in the infield you are held captive to the 10 dollar golf cart ride and no way to walk out.   No bridge. No tunnel. No way to get out without paying.  Until Friday afternoon. When you can walk to get a tram that takes you to a very non convenient location.\n\nGood job to tallidaga.

Just 30 minutes south of Columbus, GA or Phenix, City (I didn't spell it wrong) Alabama Bluff Creek this weekend was very quiet. There were maybe 12 camp sites occupied of 83 available. Camp host and campers all said it was unusual for the second weekend after Memorial Day Weekend. If you use the COE website for reservations know that the camp map says sites have no access to the water / lake. Even if the map shows campsites up next to the water, understand that the campsite overlooks the lake and inlets, but from 6 to 8 feet directly above the campsite. For many campsites, you can see the water, but would have to have a rope ladder to access the water.\nThis is one of the smaller COE parks we know of on the Chattahoochee River. The property is well kept as are the bathhouses with laundry. This campground is very fisherman friendly with a screened in fish cleaning station and cleaning tables at every site. Most of the sites are separated by 30 feet of dense brush. Most sites are deeply shaded. (Ours was so shaded we needed the interior lights in the trailer at high noon.) Most sites are easy to back into. Only those along the Bluff Creek side have direct access to the water. There is only one thing that is a drawback, and that is the pulpwood mill adjacent to the park on the Mill Creek side. When we go back, and we will go back, we will camp on the Bluff Creek side and put a little more room between us and the pulp mill.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d2be094f2d93d:0x2468c1a3120abb57"}

So total of 4 vehicles(can only have 3 per campsite). The lady had an idea that to be able for all 4 vehicles to come in we pay for an extra lot. We asked if we paid for that lot could we put just the boat and a vehicle there(we only have 1 camper and no tent) she said that was fine. We pay for the lot and she starts having a fit that we are just putting the boat and a car on the lot(even though she just said it was fine) but then says it's fine though and allows us to continue anyway. The next morning my brother shows up and she mentions the lot with the boat and car and calls the park ranger to tell us to remove it. So we say that's fine and we remove my car from our original site and park it out of the park. She then yells at us we only have 30 mins to remove the boat and car from the extra site or she would have us kicked out after it was her idea and we paid for it. I will never be coming back here.

It has several rv spots which include wifi. This quaint spot is in the country but close enough to stores that it wont take you 5 min to get to town. This rv park also has cabins for rent for very affordable prices. Cabins include wifi and satelight tv. They can include 1 or 2 beds. The 1 bed cabins include a couch and coffee table. The standard micro wave and dorm fridge are also included. There is enough space to really make it a roomy place. Each cabin also has added boot brush to help clean your boots from a hard days work. I love this place and will stay here every time we are this way. Mr Joe, the manager, is friendly and ensures everyone is safe and made welcome here. Ms Angie is one of the sweetest people ive ever had the pleasure of meeting. She will make sure your stay is pleasant and comfortable.

The young man who is currently serving as camp host was very pleasant and accommodating. However, upon our arrival, it wasn't very clear how to actually check-in. It was mid-afternoon on a Friday and the onsite General Store was closed. There was a sign on the door with a phone number so I called that and we were told to find a site and the camp host would arrive shortly. We stayed in the tent camping section for 3 nights, total cost was $66. Unfortunately the nearest outhouse was quite a walk from our site and we were only about halfway back into the camping area. I've been camping for 34 years and I don't think I have ever had to walk that far to use a bathroom. We had to drive to the bathhouse for showers because it's even farther than the outhouses and it's partway down a 25 mph road without sidewalks. While the bathhouse was pretty clean, the mini trash cans were not emptied the entire time we were there and with only one shower in each of the men/women's bathrooms, we often had to wait in lines with 2 or 3 people ahead of us. There's a great boat launch which was being utilized for a fishing tournament qualifying event the weekend we stayed so there was a ton of trucks/trailers coming and going and when we left in our car for a trip to town, we were blocked into the tent area by trucks lined up to pull their boats out of the water. There are signs posted not to block the road, and I realize how difficult it would be to enforce it, but I would recommend anyone planning to stay to check if similar events might be held and avoid the park at those times. Also, for some strange reason the tent area road was blocked off in several places by rope so we had to kind of forge our own way in some places which concerned me since I don't have a 4-wheel drive vehicle.  I think overall it's a really great campground, we felt isolated from other campers and our site was beautifully situated in the shade on a bluff above Tensaw River. The bugs were kind of bad but that was expected, we were prepared with bug spray. We also kept a smoky fire burning which helped.  I would love to see an outhouse placed in the middle of the tent area since the closest one was at the boat launch. I also recommend adding a map of the grounds to your website. We'd stay here again if there was an outhouse added to the tent area; otherwise, we probably won't come back which sucks because it's really beautiful. We really did enjoy ourselves, though.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611860781770, "text": "Thank you !"}, "gmap_id": "0x889af4bcafb9bedf:0x6ae3d9a300153c16"}
