This really isn't much of an issue because I just ask them when I get there.\n\nHowever, the consistency of quality of the food hasn't been good since around June. We order bread bites a lot from there and sometimes they are drenched in oil to the point that they ooze out a lot with every bite (not good) and others it is bone dry with not even sauce to dip them in (also not good). Sometimes the bites are REALLY undercooked and sometimes they are just right. I understand it is different employees making the pizza, but sometimes the stuff is good and other times I don't even eat it because it is inedible. Ordering now is a 50/50 gamble on whether I will actually be eating what they give me. The pizza is often the same (undercooked or just right).\n\nAlso one time they gave us a cheesy bread instead of bread bites and then when we called about it they basically called us liars. We just wanted what we ordered and we order from there A LOT.\n\nRecently we have cut back on ordering from there because of the consistency issues. We used to order at least twice a week and now it is about once a month.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb33aefa62e9b:0xdcf1ec70484217f5"}
