All injuries she received at work from a severe mechianary accident. Needless to say my mother and grandmother wanted and needed to see her. So I went and got my grandmother with alzhiemers from her home. Anyway, monday just after 12 I got to my mother's house where my grandmother was staying with her. I helped get them get loaded in my mothers van, which would be much easier to travel in than my 2 door mustang. I drove them to visit my aunt, their sister and dauther. I helped get them loaded back into my mother's van along with my aunt and her wheelchair this time and took them to visit some people we go to church  with that they haven't seen and really missed. After getting back to my aunts house from visiting, I unloaded my passengers and helped them inside. Inside someone from church had made food so we stayed for dinner together. So around a little after 10pm my mother was ready to go so I loaded everything back up and drove from Morgan County where my aunt lives to Owens cross roads where my mother lives and dropped her off at home. She was worried because of my terminal illness I had pushed myself to hard that day and insisted I had to talk with her on the phone my entire ride home back into Huntsville. She didn't want me to be sleepy and drive. Keep in mind though this is getting close to 11pm and I haven't been in my car since around 12 noon. So I hop in my carand cranked my Mustang. I turned my lights on and start heading on my way home to Huntsville. Before I get pulled out of the subdivision I get the call from my mom and we talk while driving home. As I am driving through Owens Cross Roads my left head light goes out. I thoght that's weird so I switched my lights off and on real fast thinking maybe it was just some glitch. The light came back on for a short duration and went back off. Since there wasn't much traffic at all this late I turned my bright lights on when I could without blinding people. Like any other law abiding citizen I was afraid I may get pulled over for this. So I prayed I would make it home without any trouble so the next morning I could go get this light fixed. I made it into Huntsville and less than 2 blocks from home when I saw a police car behind me. I told my mom I needed to let her go and before we could say bye I saw the police lights. So I got pulled into a shopping center. This lady ,Officer Peterson, walks up and says my head light is out. I tried to explain what happened and the steps I was doing to try to be safe and how I was already planning to get it fixed first thing the next day when businesses reopened. She was not concerned with any of that and interrupted me asking for license, registration, and insurnace. I get out my license and registration noticing another male officer pulled up and was back there talking to her partner. As I'm pulling up my esurance app to show my insurance id cards I mess up my password forgetting I needed a capital letter. Before reattempting she orders me to give her the license and registration and then walks off with them. I got my card pulled up immediately as she had stepped away and was flashing my phone out of the car to let her know. To my surprise she comes back awhile later with 2 tickets 1 for improper lights and 1 for failure or refusal to display insurance. When I tried to ask questions I was agressively interrupted and shut up. I tired showing her the insurance card and she refused to take saying it wasn't legal I needed a paper copy. Again she was agressively shutting me until I was afraid to say anything else so I took my tickets and left. I hate when cops like that give other good cops that kind of reputation that's why I left this comment in great detail. She abused her authority, broke the law, and intimidated me into silence.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f5794f11df:0x673d610eec7d0ffd"}

And the phenix city police have the gall to say that your story is DIFFERENT than the false accusers. Of course my story is DIFFERENT! This phenix city cops just ANGER me so much!\n\nIt just angered meThe phenix city police just stood their. When I told them that me and my family member didn't deserve to be assaulted. When my black neighbor along with their kids had followed us on 05/29/2018. There son cut us off on woodland dr in phenix city.\n\nAnd  they continue to follow us on hiway 80 all the way downtown phenix city headed into columbus. Where he started screaming at me telling don't mess with me. And he was saying PROVANITY at me verbal abusing me.\n\nThey instructed their son not to let us pass them. And they was driving slowly on purpose, Which I recorded on my cell phone. Then th eloud mouth mother got out of the car, during a traffic light in Columbus. Yelling at me to stop fliming her son. She is full of it after how he was cutting us off.\n\nThen he her husband got out of the car demanding me that I stop fliming or he would do it himself. So he slapped the phone out of my hand violentely and it hit my elderly grandmother, who was sitting in the drivers seat.\n\nThe they falsely lied to the police saying my mother. Who was driving was break checking them and driving slowly. And the phenix city police seemed to belive their side of the story more. And the one of the phenix city police ANGERLY told me, that they don't take sides.\n\nThey also didn't believe that I recorded it. Then they told me they are two sides to every story. Yes they are and my neighbors left out how her husband slapped the phone out of my hand violently and it hit my grandmother.\n\nThe police department is not FAIR. Like how they show favortism to certain neighbors and let their dogs roam around the neighbor without a leash. And they fine other neighbords and pick up their dogs.\n\nThe phenix city police claims that they. Follow the laws of the state of Alabama! HA! the police department makes up their own laws! And they aren't fair or transparent to victims of assault or harassment. Instead they allow anyone to FALSELY ACCUSE people!\n\nThis is why my neighbors walk around so hawtie. I'm not allowed to have fun or enjoy the summer. It just out rages them when I don't let them bother me! Why should I let them control my mind or live in fear with them falsely accusing me. Because the phenix city police deparment don't do their job!\n\nBecause they don't enforce the current laws. But make up their own! The corruption has never left phenix city when the national guard came into town  over 60 years ago. When they don't file charges on the assaulter their is corruption involved and kick backs that the police are receiving!\n\nThe police are told by their bosses not to listen to both sides! That proves how corrupt and criminal  and UNFAIR! the phenix city police department is!\n\nThe phenix city police don't treat everyone fair or equally. Because they rather believe the neighbors who are falsely accusing their neighbor they are harassing. Calling the police falsely on the neighbor you're harassing is harassment to!\n\nOther cities in the country prosecute people for falsely calling 911.  But not here in phenix city!\n'\nI'm  sure that if i had to shoot this man for assaulting me. The phenix city police department would not enforce the stand your ground law for me.

The exit is almost always backed up but never have I seen anybody sit on the shoulder of the road in a line waiting to get off the exit. There was as least 10 cars on the shoulder of the road before we even came upon the exit. I wasnt sure what was going on, I thought maybe there was a wreck so I continued to slow down until I saw the exit lane appear and when I did I turned on my blinker so I could get over. I saw an officer in a police truck with Owens Cross Roads on the side and assumed the police would surely let me over. I continued inching slowly to the right with my blinker on and the police officer pushed forcefully up so I couldnt get over and then rolled down his window and started yelling at me, \"you better watch where you're going.\" I am in shock at how disrespectful and rude you're police officer acted when a car is simply trying to get over in a correct and legal manner. I can't believe your police officer would rather have a car sit at a halt on I10 blocking traffic than let them over. Chivalry is surely dead.\n*I posted this on the Owens Cross Roads police department page as well but thought I should post here also so the Foley police department is aware that people are now using the shoulder as a new turning lane.
