I tried to piddle with it but decided that I needed to let an expert handle it since water had gotten in the motor. I had some bad luck with previous PWC mechanics in the area so I was apprehensive. Fred at Advanced Watercraft took it in and diagnosed several issues. It was back running in a week. Me and my kids took it out the day we picked it up and by the end of the day it had taken on water again. WAIT! I know it sounds like they didn't fix it, but I took it back to Fred and AW- he was apologetic and accommodating. Turns out in addition to the items he had fixed, a previous mechanic had routed some water lines incorrectly and caused an additional water issue. Although it was not his fault, Fred insisted that he would fix the boat and he did it at no charge. This type of commitment to service is rare these days.

It took two weeks to get back about parts.  At that point the parts were out of warranty.  So we paid for them and shipping.  We got the wrong parts.  I even took picture the second time.  We got parts that look similar but size was wrong, would not work.  So Mailed them back along w one of the brake pads off the 4 wheeler and tracked them..  I found out that the package was delivered Thursday 4/28 .  I called and was told spouse was sick bit she sent picture to manufacture.  No call that we got them, they are working on it,, nothing.  This has been the way we have been treated.  You have to chase them down to get answers.  I asked to be called by the end of the week, with answers and a solution!

I told them that I wanted to get the carburetor cleaned  and to look over the go cart for anything else it needed. They called me the next day and said it had no compression. I told them that's odd because when I purchased the cart, I checked the compression and it was at 90lbs. They said I don't know what to tell you but we are only get 60lbs. AT this point I understood they didn't want to work on it and I picked it up and took it to Dr. Joe's in Ensley. They found the carburetor was gumed up and the vacuum line.

As we were on vacation the shop kept us updated on everything that was going on. (A part was having to be ordered from out of state) The original quote was $1,000 which I was OK with because they wanted to do a transmission flush as well. For the amount of work and parts I was happy with price. They called about half way through our week long trip to give us an update and the shop owner stated he would have it done before we got back or worst case senario, the day we got back. He also stated he thought it would be a bit cheaper, about $950, well that's great. No problem there! So the day we got home he called and said the car was finished and that he was able to do all the work for $860!!! He very well could have charged me the $1000 and I would have gladly payed.

Downtown car care was the closest place to me and I\u2019m so glad I was able to get their help. As soon as I called, they sent a tow truck and the owner was able to work with me on the cost of the tire I needed. Because I had a security bolt on my wheel and didn\u2019t have the key for it, they had to remove the bolt \u2014 and they handled it for free! Instead of replacing both tires in the back, they only replaced the one that blew after looking at the condition of the other wheel which was super helpful since I told them I was on a budget.
