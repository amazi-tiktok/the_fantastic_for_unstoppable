USE SOMEONE ELSE!! We were wrong in Alabama and we handled it. We were arrested on a misdemeanor marijuana charge and live in another state. We agreed on 15%, instead of normal 10%. After we are released, they \"offered\" us a ride, 2 miles to where we had to pay to get our car out of impound. The owner and his wife would send our receipt by email and gave me the change from our friends who had sent bail money. Upon receiving our receipts, these people took 20% of our bond and charged us $65 for the trip to our car. When we asked them about it, we were basically told to get bent. So, if you want to get screwed in Alabama, let these people do it. Otherwise find another bondsman and line his pockets.
