As a result, my case was settled by dismissal and I never sat foot into the courtroom. This was trully a blessing as I like to keep my family and personal affairs out of any forms of public veiwings.\nThanks so much  - Attorney Howie - may you continue to receive Spiritual blessing for the righteous work that your firm is doing.\nCedric D.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1630083495129, "text": "Thanks so much for the amazing review as your divorce attorney in Morgan County!

Half the time, they didn't return phone calls either. Halfway through the 'mediation' I got the distinct feeling that he was working for the other side. He obviously thinks he can make a living by gaining clients, screwing them over, and going on to the next victim. He must be too young and immature to grasp the concept that most people will need an attorney more than ONCE in their lifetime, and if he thinks he can be successful without the benefit of repeat clients, he is delusional. If he was the last attorney on earth, I would never hire him again. My divorce is final; I'm still missing half my belongings; he's promised me a refund twice and never delivered. On top of that, he suggested we file a contempt motion because of the fact that I was not given all the belongings I was entitled to. He didn't mention at the time that he planned on charging me an additional $1500 to do what I'd already paid him to do. In my opinion, the reason all his pictures on FB look like gangster photos is because he is a crook. He will stand there and 'listen' to you, but he is just pretending to hear you.

This harrowing experience began for my family and I around the end of August of 2018 when my beloved uncle died unexpectedly. We began paperwork for me to administer estate by which this process has been grossly bumbled through and fumbled 95% of the time. Mrs. Shoen didn't keep my family and I updated as to the status of the case and judges wishes at any point in time. Nor did she even bother to let us know that court dates had been canceled due to heirs requests for extension. Nor did she return our phone calls or emails in a timely manner despite being paid $1000 up front to get started on our case. Then she all of a sudden calls me hurriedly around Thanksgiving black Friday  to request the remaining funds due to be paid which was not in line with our original verbal agreement. I contested her request and the amount was decreased to $228 with the remaining to be paid after estate opening. After this scenario, things all seemed to go downhill rapidly.  Heirs we calling my family with information from probate we had no knowledge of despite having hired Kayla to be our representative which was disheartening and also very stressful. To date we have had 3 canceled court dates on technicality of not having all necessary actions completed prior to court by my attorney. My last court date was June 26 at 2pm by which I spent the entire month or so prior trying to contact Kayla for confirmation and a check in to ensure our readiness to move forward. My calls and texts were not answered and\nI never heard anything back from her. Not even a return email was received until the day before the court date. Mrs. Shoen apologized in her email for her gross negligence in handling my uncle's case and said she had closed her practice and that she was withdrawing herself from my case and mailing my case file and a refund check for all money's paid back to me. I spoke with her about this on June 25th. I asked that she send me the USPS confirmation so that I could follow up on the file and refund myself, but she never sent it. Today it is July 5, 2019 and I still have not received anything by mail as promised and also no response to my follow up email...Throughout all this long drawn out process my mom has fallen Ill and lost 40lbs due to stress. To boot, I am dealing with my own distinct stresses in trying to get this estate resolved for my mom because my uncle was her best and only close friend.  I know Kayla may not understand this because it isn't her family or her mom. I understand that Mrs Shoen has been dealing with quiet a few deeply challenging issues of her own here lately and that's why I've been so lenient as I know she is probably still learning how to juggle lifes difficulties simultaneously with lifes obligations and workplace responsibilities. I have compassion for her and truly wish her the best in life but there was left much to be desired from the very minimal level of care attention and concern given to our case. I just wish I would known this before hand as my mom and I have wasted an entire year and still have yet to even get the estate opened. I'm so disappointed, stressed and literally exhausted from this process and dealing with lackadaisical representation has made this process the most cumbersome experience ever. At least when I finally get the file and refund I can move on with my life. I pray and wish I had had the same positive experience as some others have had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb093ee5187:0x87380fb81b949ade"}

Mrs. Hardeman Saint had two weeks to the day to get prepared for my \u2022\u2022cases\u2022\u2022.

They was always accessible, friendly, easy to understand, affordable, and went above and beyond to finally get me closure on my parents estates and all the other frivolous lawsuits that was filed as a smoke screen and to cost me more unnecessary money. In less than 45 days they was able to put all of the bogus frivolous lawsuits to bed forever.  If you want attorneys to get things done correctly and quickly the LOOK NO FURTHER ~~ HIRE THE SAINT FIRM ~~. Also just for the record Beth is a bulldog and doesn't take any bull from other attorneys. She will call them out!! She fought for me, didn't back down, was always available and had to go against a very evil crooked lawyer and client of that particular attorney.

We moved to Huntsville to be near the ALS Clinic. She died last summer leaving everything to me in her will. We had some property just in her name so her will had to be probated. I knew it was simple since I had done it three times before. Unfortunately it requires a lawyer. I didn\u2019t think it was worth asking for recommendations so I googled and found Ms. Doty.\n\nShe and her paralegal Ms. Carter seemed nice and sympathetic so I hired them. Out of courtesy I asked Ms. Doty how she would like me to pay her. I never had any lawyer or accountant imply I should pay before the job was done but she said, \u201cMy landlord expects to be paid\u201d.  Out of vulnerability I paid her whole bill.\n\nAfter the required six months I phoned their office to see where we stood. My phone message was not returned nor were my emails responded to. I finally got Ms. Carter on the phone and she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been very busy but I\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never had a lawyer or accountant put things off that could be done in the quickest amount of time but I did with them. You expect things to be done on time and not when the time suits them.\n\nAgain things drug on. I finally sent a letter to Ms. Doty and some more action took place. I was in touch with the probate judge\u2019s office and found out when the papers closing the estate were finally sent in and when the judge signed them and put them in Ms. Doty\u2019s box. I waited and waited and finally went to Ms. Doty\u2019s office unannounced three weeks later and there was the signed paper closing the estate under a stack of papers on Ms. Carter\u2019s desk!\n\nI\u2019ve never been treated this way by a \u201cprofessional\u201d and I wrote Ms. Doty asking for half my money back or I\u2019d write a review and a letter to the Alabama State Bar. Ms. Doty wrote back to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that you are experiencing financial difficulties\u201d and that she would not refund half my money. I did sell some of my wife\u2019s property and it was in an estate checking account as required.  I told Ms. Carter that after the initial six months but in no way am I having \u201cfinancial difficulties\u201d. What if I were? Wouldn\u2019t you want to close the estate for your client as soon as possible to help them?\n\nI have written the Alabama State Bar a four page complaint letter explaining everything with nothing but facts as I told Ms. Doty I would. I included all correspondences I had with her office and my communications with the probate judge\u2019s office.\n\nThe Alabama State Bar works like our Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama. I hope they will respond to my complaint about Ms. Doty like our Board would if she had been a dentist.\n\nI will never pay a lawyer\u2019s total fee up front again. Like I said, with my wife just dying, I was vulnerable and wanted to trust someone. I picked the wrong people.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb05bd0af23:0xb55d784cbc7a88f8"}

In the span of only four years, she has untangled three complicated estates which overlapped one another as the decedents were also one another's heirs.  Her counsel has been very helpful to both our dying family members and to those of us left behind. Dee processes all the legal twists and turns of an issue and  straightens it all out to protect the interests and liabilities of the decedents, their heirs and the estate representatives. As the trustee to one estate, executor to another, and administrator & realtor for the other estate, I have had to rely heavily on Dee's continued counsel and guidance, which has been impeccable. Staying on top of complex matters, while grieving the loss of family members, can get tricky and overwhelming at times, and important documents can be missed. But with Dee's wonderful paralegal, Debbie, always on top of everything, I never worry that I will make a mistake that will injure someone. Debbie calls and texts me when I need to sign documents or pay expenses, and she keeps me and the process up-to-date and always moving forward to closure. These two women have guided and walked our family through the most complex time of our lives, and I recommend them to everyone I know who needs a really sharp estate attorney with a smart, on-the-ball paralegal. I must add that if there is a time you need an attorney to fight for you, if you don't choose these ladies, just pray that the entity you need protection from hasn't chosen them.  As nice as they are, when it comes to protecting their clients, they don't play.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e0edc682359:0x33450141cdb7c545"}

I had worked for over 40 years and trying to adjust to being home all day and learning to manage severe pain was almost more than I could handle. Fortunately, I have a great family and church support system for all of that. However, dealing with arranging and establishing my long term income was a stress factor I had no idea how to handle especially not knowing what was required. Even when my long term disability insurance company recommended that I use the Friedman Law Firm, I was concerned with how much it would cost me and how much interaction it would take to get them all the information they would need. I was so pleased and relieved with the whole process. Friedman was very sympathetic and understanding of how much pain I was dealing with. They only asked of me what they absolutely needed to. They made contacts with doctors and therapists directly as needed to put my case together. I was very impressed with how promptly and completely they took care of getting my Social Security Disability approved and the amount that I was approved for. I don't know why anyone would want to go through that process on their own. I would highly recommend using the Friedman Law Firm.

I first looked for a local attorney around my area and was told that they would not take my case for one reason or another. My disability was very focused, at first, on 1 main thing. Long term side effects from a medical treatment i had gone through and never came back from! I did NUMEROUS searches for attorneys that specialize or are knowledgeable in my particular case/medical conditions. I first hired a firm from up north that will take about any case, but you never get a straight answer. they could not even tell me why after my original denial, I wasn't getting a \"reconsideration\" phase before my hearing..which i never had to attend BTW ( we won my case without a hearing and by records alone and dr \"testimony\").The moment the legal \"team\" could not answer that question, i went back on a mission. I came across Friedman Law Firm.  It never mattered to me that my attorneys were in state or out of state. with technology today,most everything can be done through a phone call, conference call, or via email and internet. The days of going in and sitting down with your attorney face to face is still common,but absolutely not necessary. Believe me when i say that I feel like I know my paralegal and Jessica Friedman personally, but we have never met! Going back a minute, I ended up calling and speaking to a paralegal from Friedman Firm who answered my question about the reconsideration phase in the first 5 minutes!!The other firm hadn't called me back with an answer in days! After that, She got a lot of info from me, went and spoke with Miss Jessica about my case. She had more questions. I answered. the poor paralegal went back and forth a few times that day, but at the end of the day I had fired the previous firm and KNEW I WAS IN THE RIGHT HANDS NOW. Even with the long distance between our cities.\nI have NEVER EVER, NEVER not gotten a return response by my legal team- either called back or emailed! I was a nervous wreck through my whole case, but they were as cool as cucumbers!! It didn't click until I won my case JUST HOW GOOD, ARTICULATE, AND CONFIDENT THEY REALLY ARE!!! NO NONSENSE. THEY HAVE GREAT INTEGRITY IN THE OFFICE AS WELL!!!!!\nCompetent, knowledgeable, on top of things (even when you might not think so haha), great great legal teams, personable interactions with clients, will ALWAYS answer any questions you may have.\nI could go on and on about this firm and how i give them so much of the credit for changing my life forever! yes, im the disabled one. im also only 42 years old. they had to prove to a Judge that it was/is a legitimate claim, esp with my age being so young.. without them i could have never gotten my disability at all!!!\nI don't believe anyway!\nIF YOU WANT A FIRM THAT WORKS HARD FOR THEIR CLIENTS AND KEEPS IN CONTACT ALONG THE WAY.. THIS IS THE FIRM FOR YOU!!!\nDON'T LET THE DISTANCE BE A FACTOR. THEY CAN TRAVEL TOO YA KNOW (WHEN NECESSARY.). ;) THANKS JESSICA AND ALL THE STAFF THERE AT THE FIRM!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562338419057, "text": "Ms. Jones, thank you for your kind words.

They actually reach out to me that Sunday morning. I had a face to face meeting with Mr. Richard Thiry the following Monday. Mr. Richard went above and beyond my expectations. He was very passionate about his clients and it shows in his work and spirit. The legal process was easy and stress free, I was very informed throughout the whole process by Mr. Richard and his team, and I felt at ease asking any questions I had. Richard Thiry was very diligent and got me a settlement quickly. Fast forwarding on June 14,2018 I was again involved in another car accident on the job after only been employed 2 days. I immediately reach out to THIRY & CADDELL, LLP. Mr. Richard no longer practice law because he had retired but his daughter Renee Thiry also is a lawyer there.  First, I'd like to say THANK YOU to Renee Thiry and the staff. They are very professional, personable and very helpful team.  Renee always keeps her word and came through for me when I needed her most. I hired Renee for my workers comp and personal injury suit.  Renee always made me feel that she had things under control and was on top of the case. My job terminate me after 7 months because of permeant injury due to the car accident. She help me get my unemployment to help me out until my case was settle. As a single mom with two kids it help out A LOT. My workers comp case has now been settled and i am so relieved and will be forever grateful. I know that she is also going to do a great job with my personal injury case as well. I honestly don't know what I would do without them. If you want the best then you definitely want to hire Renee Thiry.  I cannot thank her enough for all she is doing for me.

He asked me some questions about the circumstances and was very attentive.\n\nFinally, what really impressed me about him was that once he realized that my dad's house was not close to where he typically practices; he advised me that I would most likely be better served to consult an attorney that was closer to my dad's house. He said that he could handle the case; however, it would become more expensive because that area is approximately 4 hours from him. In my opinion, most people wouldn't even care about that. They would only care about running the bill up on you. In addition to that, he even found and referred me to an attorney in that area that could assist me.\n\nI certainly appreciate his honesty and his assistance. I wish that I could've had that opportunity to work with him in my time of need. Take care, Attorney Pierce, and thank you very much. It was truly a pleasure.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1619020883632, "text": "Thank you so much! I really appreciate the kind words.

First, after we settled with Mom on visitation and ect.. we got the paper work and she had omitted an entire year of child visitation, she filed to have it corrected and filed it wrong, then we discovered she omitted another VERY important agreement that was made between them. I emailed her about it and she told me to email the Mom's attorney (unprofessional), I did so and copied her. A few days past and I never heard anything back so I emailed her again, she then told me it was not on the agreement made between them and sent the paper work I had sent her and the Mom's attorney. I told her I was confused, it was at the bottom right of the 2nd page, to which she replied oh I see now-ok, I will get an amendment filed. The next day, I asked her if she had reached out to Mom's attorney and she replied: Respectfully, there is no need to send ongoing emails, she said she would only communicate with my son going forward. She never even said she was sorry for messing up the papers 3 separate times. When we hired her, I explained that we knew we were not her only clients but this was very important to us. At first things seemed ok but once I paid the final bill and we discovered she left stuff out of the papers her attitude changed. When you make a mistake you apologize for the mistake and correct it, not make the client feel guilty for asking for it to be corrected.In addition to all of this, we were having my son added to the birth certificate, Margret told us to give it 2 months after the judge signed off on it and we could just get a copy at the Health Dept, when my son went to get it Vital Records had the birth certificate on hold because \"our attorney\" did not pay the $49.50 fee to have it changed nor were we EVER told about the fee. It took him 3 hours to get it straightened out. I would NOT recommend her to ANYONE. Respect goes both ways.

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.  As of May 2020, I have successfully completed the PTIP program and am currently working with Mr. Crumbly on having my charges expunged.  I am very pleased with the services I have received from Mr. Crumbly and his team and would highly recommend them.

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

I am an aerospace engineer here in Huntsville, and, like many of you, hold a security clearance. These charges HAD to get dropped if I had any hope of keeping my clearance and my job. I had never been in any trouble before so I wasn't sure how to go about things when the public defender asked me how I wanted to plea.. she told me to plea guilty and pay the county for a class that may or may not get the charges dropped. After getting some much needed advice from a kind correctional officer outside, I declined that plea and decided to plea not-guilty and seek out my own legal counsel. I found Mr. Crumbley's office and the charges ended up being dropped/dismissed. Him and his team, even the front office, they were all excellent. Couldn't have asked for a better outcome. Now my life, my clearance and my job will remain in tact.

As soon as he walks in the courtroom you should know that you will be taken care of. This mans representation is like the results of having the combination of Peyton Manning in the regular season and Tom Brady in the playoffs which in other words is about as good as is gets when in comes to criminal defense representation. I honestly do not have enough words or ways that I can use to describe how high level of an attorney he is and worth every dollar of the premium cost to afford him to represent you because you get what you pay for so you won\u2019t be disappointed no matter how guilty you are of your charges.

False advertisement Really!! My true story: My now ex husband and I went through a chaotic divorce and his lawyer was Mr. McGhee. My experience is based on what I dealt with in phone and email conversations as well as what was told to me by my ex husband and McGhee's  Secretary and how the divorce was handled. First Mr. Mcghee, does not like to speak to people that are \"Pro Se\" (representing yourself) so even though you worked for over 10 years in the law field as a paralegal and you can easily save your money by doing the settlement and divorce yourself, Shawn McGhee will make sure to give you a hard time. Not only does he lie and says there is a conflict of interest, which is why he won't speak to you which by the way, THAT IS NOT TRUE, but he will not answer any of the calls. For whatever reason he was not able to speak to me which to me seems very unprofessional, he would often have his secretary let me know what was needed for the divorce to be settled. I think because I do know what I needed to do legally, and trust me lawyers hate people that have worked in law fields you cant pull a sheet over legal assistants or paralegals eyes easily, we know all the tricks.  Now his secretary had given me some information that had holes in what she said that included the discovery process and hearings as well as the laws. Because of the communication between me and her and then what she told my ex husband of what I said, which were twisted, this made the divorce messy and long . And I believe the reason was for trial which is very expensive, but lawyers love expensive. Now one thing which is grounds for a grievance is that Mr. McGhee gave advice on the amount of payments for child support that should be paid which is unethical and should only be done by a referee. Mr. Mcghee, has no compassion for children as he informs his clients that they don't need to be responsible parents and pay for the kids until a judge says so, which to me makes me wonder about his character. Being out of state I was not able to do much, and my ex did not even live in Alabama as law requires in order to file but as usual somehow McGhee got around that. I have worked for law firms since I was 16 years old I could never work for someone that does things that are unethical, shady and down right wrong  he has no moral character, and I would be scared if my papers would be questioned by a judge with the amount of lies that my ex and his lawyer gave to me.  Please look at other Law firms that will look at your case and care enough to not control your decisions and won't run up your bill for no reason. Me and my ex husband  managed to settle together without the hearsay talk of his lawyer. The issue I have is there are amazing lawyers out there and Mr. Mcghee is the reason that lawyers have such a bad reputation. Make sure you chose a lawyer that will care about your interests and especially the kids, don't let the kids get lost in the divorce they are the most important thing, don't let the lawyer stress you or the other party or you will cause more harm and extend something that is not good for anyone. And make sure to hold your ground. Research on your lawyer don't chose someone because they are cheap eventually they will show you why they are cheap, Mr. Mcghee was affordable for my ex-husband until hearings and trial came around and then up goes his hourly.
