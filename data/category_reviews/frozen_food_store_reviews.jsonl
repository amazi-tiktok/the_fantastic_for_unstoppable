Was trying to just find some cute jewelry. Unfortunately, we were subjected to a soap opera from the \"manager\" behind the counter and her friend in the store. We got to hear all about how the gentleman in her life was still talking to his ex and she would beat his a**. This is not professional for a work environment. The conversation was loud enough to be heard across the entire store. We left without purchasing anything due to the atmosphere there. I'll be highly surprised if I visit again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1373405910053, "text": "Hi Marissa,\n\nMy name is Connie - I am the owner and manager of Fanci Free. Thank you for taking time to leave a review and bringing this incident to my attention.  I was not in the store on the day of your visit, but as soon as I heard what happened I made several unsuccessful attempts to contact you. I discovered this written review about your experience only last week.\n\nI wish to extend my sincere apologies to you and your husband. I want you to know I have personally addressed the situation.\n\nAt Fanci Free, we value each and every one of our customers. We have a long-standing reputation of making our boutique and caf\u00e9 a place where everyone feels happy and leaves happy. I am so glad that you enjoyed the quality and appeal of Fanci Free (as reflected in your ratings) - but on the day of your visit, we fell short of our overall mission.\n\nAs a token of our appreciation for your patronage, and to make amends, I invite you to return and enjoy a free meal with us. Then I will be happy to help you find that cute jewelry you were looking for - we have plenty to choose from!\n\nPlease call and ask for me (Connie Dismukes).\n\nI look forward to meeting you and your husband.
