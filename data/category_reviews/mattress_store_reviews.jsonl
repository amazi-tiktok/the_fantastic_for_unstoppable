The owner is a very kind man who you can tell has been in the business for a very long time. When purchasing something that can cost as much as furniture does now, it is important to purchase from someone who will honor their word. Not only did they offer several ways for us to finance, but delivery quick being recently relocated to this remote area in Alabama and no family to help move furniture was extremely nice. The owner gave us real honest advice not based off purely an income percentage of what he would receive on each piece. Because we were buying a complete living room and bedroom package including a mattress it was a big purchase and he was willing to help with the more that we purchased. I recently have had several back surgeries and the mattress was the most important piece. He personally spent quite a while with us walking through explaining the purpose of each detail on each mattress and again we were first time home buyers so we didn't really know what we were doing with buying a mattress; never had anything besides hand-me-downs.

It allows you to pick a new mattress, try it out for 120 nights, and if you don't sleep happy within those 120 nights, (for a small processing fee) you can do a one time return or exchange!

I felt that this was something I wanted to share with everyone who is looking to buy a mattress.\nWhen I buy a mattress it\u2019s like buying a car, my wife and I went to 4 stores, one of them had aggressive sales pitch tactics, this may be why they have the word \u201cFIRM\u201d in their name.\nAnyways, I was talking with the guys at the fire station and they started to rave about the mattresses they had slept on at another fire station. They said they would do business with The sleep center when it came time to buy for there home. So since this owner took care of my friends I decided I would check them out. When we walked in the door the manager met us with a hello from the back of the store, he saw that we had two kids and asked if we cared if they played in a children\u2019s area (Automatically we were less stressed) so while the kids played he asked the standard questions and then directed us to three types to choose from but then something amazing happened.... he left us alone! Lol, me an my wife were able to lay on each bed and were able to be honest with ourselves  about the comfort and the cost. At one point we were worried because we didn\u2019t hear our kids yelling like usually, well that\u2019s because the manager was keeping them entertained. The whole process took about 1 hour which is mainly because we couldn\u2019t decide which bed to buy. They were able to give us the best offer we have found out of all four stores and then even added some incentives! Do yourself a favor!! GO HERE FIRST, I promise you, you are wasting your time if you go anywhere else.\nP.S. Thank you for taking care of first responders, that goes a long way, now I just have to talk my Chief in replacing my mattress at the fire station!

All three of these stores have had exceptional customer service and an amazing inventory. Every staff member has been able to answer all of our questions or knows who to ask to get them.\n\nWe made our mattress purchase at the Mobile, Al location on Airport Blvd. Our sales reps were Michael & Nathan. Both of these gentlemen were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We already knew which mattress we wanted from our previous trips to Enterprise/Dothan but they helped us pick out the perfect mattress cover/protector & sheets that would help alleviate my husbands severe allergies. Nathan also went to great lengths to get us the best discounts and price for our purchases.\n\nThe delivery of our new king mattress went smoothly. Our apartments are in Saraland, which is free, and our unit is on the 3rd floor. The delivery guys carried it up with no issues and were very friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall I would say that our experience has been amazing with every Sleep Center we have worked with. This is a great place to make a mattress purchase. They have a wide range of brands/prices & several special mattresses for allergy prone clients.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1516760602996, "text": "Thanks for shopping with us and taking the time to leave us such kind words!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7350d88ab9:0x2ca38cf06b581b9e"}

Everything they carry is nothing but highly quality name brand product.  The store manager, Michael, is one of the friendliest, and probably one of the most honest persons, you will ever meet.\n\nAfter losing all my belongings in a fire, I decided to replace my Sofa Bed with a Futon, but knew nothing about them except for what I could find on the Internet, and had lots of questions.  I searched the Internet for places to buy, and right away noticed the Sleep Center with 30 Five-Star reviews, so off I went with over a dozen question in my head.\n\nWhen I entered the store, Michael was speaking with a customer on his cell, and upon seeing me asked the customer if he could greet me.  After we shook hands I told him to go back to his earlier customer, as I often deal with customers.  Once he was finished with his earlier customer I explained my predicament \u2014 he even remembered hearing about the fire.\n\nI told him what I had read online about Futons, and told every question I had, one at a time, which he answered, explained, showed and demonstrated one by one.  He never mentioned the word \"sell\", \"buy\" or \"purchase\" once.  The more questions I asked, the more he answered, explained, showed and demonstrated, as cheerful as when we fist said hello.  When I asked about the \"anti-slip pad\" that all internet articles said was a must for the mattress, he told me that it's true, but that they are nothing more than urethane foam anti-slip drawer liners available anywhere.  When I asked if he was serious, he lifted every Futon mattress they have on display to show me that that is all they use themselves.\n\nBeing an avid Geocacher, I asked Michael if he was.  He said he never heard of it, but could I explain it.  I always do one better by showing how the app works (and even the quickie online YouTube video), and point out nearby Geocaches on the app's map.  Mobile may now have new \"Cacher\" in the game.\n\nBack on track.  I bought my Futon right there on the spot.  When it was the day of delivery, their truck driver called me up exactly when they said he would, told me he was nearly loaded, and would be over in 20 minutes.  18 minutes later they were knocking on my door, two minutes ahead of the promised time from earlier in the week. 15 minutes minutes later, maybe less, I had a fully assembled Futon in my living room., without a scrap of paper or cardboard anywhere.  A perfectly professional and quality operation, from start to finish.\n\nI now need to replace my master bedroom bed, and I will be going straight back here.   I have no need to even visit anyplace else.\n\nThe bottom of all this:  if you need to buy a Bed, Futon, Mattress, or the like, or simply have questions about such, this is the place to go first.  You will be patronizing local, and patronizing family owned, and you'll never have to give it a second thought.  (If you're also a Geocacher, ask Michael if he has a game name yet.)", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1516760301546, "text": "We very much appreciate you allowing us to care for you, Jay!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7350d88ab9:0x2ca38cf06b581b9e"}

The mattress was a top name brand, however in just a couple weeks the mattress I purchased began to sag and cause some morning back issues. I quickly realized that just because I bought a brand name that its not the same quality as a mattress bought from a store that specializes in them.\nI went to Mr. Mattress and after talking with JoAnn I found the type of mattress more suitable for my needs. After reading online about the mattress I chose I also did some looking around at prices from other competitors. I was very pleasantly surprised that Mr. Mattress had them all beat! I learned yet again you get what you pay for.\nThank you so much Mr. Mattress and JoAnn for helping me find my best deal on a quality mattress right here at home.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1520527712836, "text": "Brad, thank you for telling your story!

Delivery and set up went without a hitch by his professional team.\nI highly recommend giving Good Morning Mattress a shot at helping you to find the right bed for a good nights sleep.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547330157975, "text": "Mr. Hegland it was and absolute pleasure to do business with you guys!

Melissa Triplett Berger and I purchased an expensive Sleep Number Bed with all of the bells and whistles.  It was delivered last Saturday.  There is a $200 delivery and set up charge.  The person who delivered the bed could not get our phone apps to work (we did also order controllers).  I told him I would work on it after he left (and I was successful).  That night when Melissa set her sleep number and then I set mine with the controllers, neither side of the bed seemed to do anything even though we could hear the compressor pumping air and deflating each side separately (and yes, we know that you can only do one side at a time).   In addition, whatever number we were on, the best was just uncomfortable for us. Finally, neither of our individual sides of the bed seemed level.  We decided we just didn't want the bed.  We called customer service on the following Monday (after a poor night's sleep) and after waiting 15 minutes, I told the representative my story.   He reminded me that I needed to keep the bed for 30 days before I could return it.  I asked him if he really wanted me to sleep on a bed that didn't do what it was supposed to do for another 28 days (and yes, we tried resetting the bed)?  He said that it sounded like the bed was defective.  He said, he would waive the 30 day requirement but would still have to charge me the $200 return pickup fee that was in the contract.  I then said, so, you're going to charge me $200 to return a bed that even you think is defective.  He said he could send another bed but it might be \"a few days\".  I said a) So, you're not going to discount the delivery and setup fee for a bed that is defective, nor the return fee, and b) I don't want the bed anymore.  He said we would then have to pay both the $200 delivery fee and $200 return fee.   I decided to arrange the return and called the store.  The person we bought the mattress from said what customer service is doing is ridiculous.  At the very least they should waive the return fee because it sounded to him like the bed was defective.  He wrote an email to customer service to ask them to waive the return fee.  They called and we missed the call.  After calling back and waiting 19 minutes, they said they will not waive the fee.  So, we are spending $400 for a bed we slept on one night.

For example,   there are shipping delays from overseas of products that are needed here for the assembly of furniture and chips for new cars.  Because of those delays dates change every day. When we do let our customers know a date, it can change the same afternoon which frustrates the customer even more.\n\nBefore the Pandemic, we could deliver on 90% of our goods within a 2-4 week time period. Now we cannot promise any date...the only thing we ask is that you hold on to your old furniture until your new furniture  arrives. We have even loaned out new furniture while a customer waits.\nWe have wholesale prices right now to help with that unfortunate waiting period. Some items come in next week after delivery, but some do not. It varies with every piece.\n\nWe value our customers, and if we could change what is going on in America we would . We go above and beyond for all of our customers. I just ask that you try and understand the circumstances that all retail establishments are having to deal with and navigate through. They are difficult, and we are all trying our best to get your items here as quickly as we can.\nFactories in America are also understaffed, and those who are working are doing their very best as well. Transportation is trying to find more drivers, so that items can also be delivered in a timely fashion.\nWe have kept our prices  lower than anyone  to help better ease that frustration of timely delivery dates. So it is a great time to purchase from us, but patience will be needed in case dates change on an item.\nThank you so much for your understanding, and if you did purchase from us under a different name - I am sorry for the delays, and I too wished we had control over dates fluctuating."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e9ae266e8c0cf:0x9e6dbbd1150862fd"}

A few days after selling a mattress to me he asked me to come back to the store and pick out a more expensive mattress.

Well, in fact, he had strongly encouraged me to buy that particular mattress because it was such a good deal. He had apparently sold that same mattress to several customers at a much lower price than he was supposed to and was now calling all of us back to pay for his mistake. Since I work out of town & was moving & needed that mattress delivered to my new place that weekend I refused to waste my time & money to go back to his store & pay \u201conly a few hundred dollars more\u201d per his exact words so he could recover the money he had lost. According to him he had been on an extended beach vacation and therefore was unknowledgeable of his new product line.

I completely paid it at the beginning of April 2021. From the time I fully purchased it in April to the end of May. No one had informed me of the status. I would call the store once every other week. When I called the facility they told me that the furniture was not showing delivery date. I showed concern that I have not received any possible delievery date and asked to speak to the store manager about finding another item with tbe same value that is available. Finally the store manager, (after I was concerned) said that it should be here the first week of June. I decided to not find a replacement since the manager seemed to be sure the furniture will be there. I called after the first week of June since I received no contacted in regards to delivery or any issues. Manager than proceeded to say it is now pushed to the first week of July. I received a call last week and the week prior telling me that my furniture was scheduled for first week of July. After first week of July passed, I called them Monday, July 12th, to be informed that it was again pushed to the week of July 26th. I asked the sales associate if I could get a full refund because their poor communication. And customer service makes me uneasy and I do not trust them that they will delivery my item. The manager was not there and the person said he will contact me on Wednesday when he returns. They told me that refund would not be possible because of the 72 hour no cancellation. I proceeded to call cooperate to file a complaint on their store and because it is privately owned they could not help me. They filed a complaint and said they will get in contact with me within 24-48 hours. After I received no response from cooperate and the store, I called cooperate again. During the process of calling cooperate on Friday, July 16th (less than four days since the last conversation with the store) I found out that the corner of my section is in the warehouse but that other pieces will be in august 26th. Again another time pushed and no response. Each time the dates have been undetermined or pushed further. There is no promise of a secure date. They are persistent on telling me cancellations are not possible due to the 72 hours after full purchase but yet this company does not hold themselves accountable to communication and delivery if their items. After long conversation, the sales associate on Friday, July 16th said the manager will issue a request for cancellation to the finance department and I will receive a paper check refund. I called today July 20th to ask about the status. The request was given to the finance department and now waiting for the finance department to contact me about my refund. The sales associate said that it will take up to 14 days. This is ridiculous. I understand that we are in Covid 19 times.

Please refer to Ashley Homestore\u2019s Facebook page to see my review in detail. The sales clerk ordered the wrong item. The delivery team did not honor their delivery time slot and did not have the decency to inform me in a timely manner that they were coming 2 hours early. They left the wrong dresser. I called Emmitt, the store manager, and requested for them to return to pick up the dresser, needless to say the dresser remained in my home for three weeks. I tried to contact the general manager, Nick on two occasions and, Emmitt was of no assistance and he never returned my phone calls either. After finally getting a scheduled pickup a week and a day later, the delivery team was an hour and 15 minutes late with once again no phone call or text. After posting my experience on their Facebook page, Nick called leaving a message with my phone number as the return contact. Also, someone from their management team left an email address that was not accurate. I say all this to say, my concerns have not been resolved and I did not receive the correct dresser that I paid for. Ashley Homestore will NOT admit their mistakes, correct their mistakes, nor treat their customers with respect. I spent right at $6000 and this is how they treat their customers. I pray that you read this review and reconsider patronizing this establishment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621969260317, "text": "Hello. We have seen your review and want to make things right.

Josh and I agreed on a (out the door) price that he stated would included free delivery and would include the best warranty that I could purchase. Once I got to the register to check out I was charged an additional 199.00 that was supposed to have been already applied to our agreed upon total. I didn't notice until after I left and looked over the receipt of this infraction. They told me that the set wasn't in stock and would take 3 weeks to be delivered. I offered several time to pick the set up myself but they insisted that I let them bring it out and set it up for free so I agreed. They told me that the set would come in a different dates and offered me split delivery. I told them I'd prefer if we just wait an get it all delivered at 1 time when it all arrived and they agreed. Fast forward to Thursday April 8th I called and was told that only 2 pieces were in but they were all scheduled to be there the week of the 8th. Friday the 9th I called bk and was told that the set was there. I asked when would it be delivered and was told that I had to come pick it up and that it wouldn't be delivered. Therefore I (rented) a haul and angrily went to to their store to pick it up. Once I got there I was told that it wasn't there and was at the warehouse which contradicted everything that I was told and wasn't where I originally paid for the set. At this point I was furious and Josh wasn't there so I was told. They then called him/Josh and he magically appeared from the back of the store smiling with mischief all over his face. Once he got close enough to see the anger in my eyes he detoured behind me and finally stood behind the counter accompanying the other 2 young ladies. He lied and tried to tell me that I wasn't given or offered free delivery but one of the assistants who also helped me select the set( she in particular was great and very helpful and even apologized) agreed that I was supposed to have free delivery. I then told him about the split delivery in which I knew nothing about until they offered and he dropped his head knowing that I was being honest. At this point I was furious but still needed my set. They then told me that it was at the warehouse and that the warehouse was closed. This is after they told me that it was at their location and I had to come pick it up. So now I'm standing there with a rented uhaul, being double charged for a warranty, furious and still not able to get my furniture. Long story short I still have to go pick it up again today. I would've canceled it all together but your charged a  25% restocking fee and can't return it over 3 days after the original purchase date. Josh continued to try and lie and say he told me this or that and I made him out to be a lie everytime. Josh is a lier so don't let those fb commercials fool you. My set was over 4k and paid upfront. Read over your receips as soon as you get it and make sure everything you agreed upon is stated and accurate. This is my personal experience, hopefully this will detour you from having a disastrous nightmare just as I did. Please shop else where. Hopefully everything goes smooth today once I go to pick it up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618330066688, "text": "Hello Mr. Gipson. Firstly, I would like to apologize for any miscommunications or any tribulations experienced with the Ashley Homestore Outlet. From my understanding of the matter, there were many miscommunications on the team's behalf. I am not sure why there was so much confusion with the Customer Service on this particular order, and this will be addressed to them. We are experiencing delays on orders due to covid, and though this is a common response for almost all things furniture nowadays, it is honestly the truth. Again, I would like to apologize for the lack of communication resulting in you prematurely renting a U-haul. Our Warehouse hours differ from the store hours, and this should have been addressed upfront ahead of time. I truly feel that if things had been communicated better, a lot of these issues would have been easily resolved, and that is our fault. On behalf of the company we hope you will accept our apology, and please feel free to discuss this matter further at cescalations@ahsmal.com, and a manager will respond.  With all this said, we want to thank you for shopping with us and appreciate you being a member of our community. We are striving daily to improve our business to ensure that things like this no longer happen."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2dfc4bb7ecc9:0x341dd06834bfbb31"}

We were greeted by a salesman named Alex. He seemed to be a nice guy well versed and educated in product knowledge of everything they had to showcase and sell. We instructed him that we were just looking but we'd come back if we were interested in doing business. He and his manager promised exceptional customer service. We came back about a month later ready to purchase. We spent almost $7,000 with this salesman and company and was sold several empty promises. We were told that we'd have all of our furniture at the store ready to be delivered to our brand new home that we were building by the first week of December. That didn't happen. We were promised several different customer service calls concerning our furniture. They never happened. In December we were told for 3 weeks straight that our stuff was coming and it didn't come. Finally we got some of our things only to find out that as our stuff was coming off the truck that the delivery guys forgot the mounts to put our mirror up that goes to our dresser. Also that Alex ordered 2 loveseats instead of a sofa and loveseat. When I called to make him aware of his mistake I was told immediately that it was my fault as if I made up the invoice myself. I spoke with the manager Josh he apologized and put in a new invoice for a new sofa. He said that our recliner which we are still waiting on would be here the same time the sofa would, which would be Jan. 15th. I was told that if anything changed that I would receive a call. Guess what? That didn't happen either. After the delivery guys left I noticed that they messed up my front door casing in 2 different places. I called this Thursday to inform them of the damage and check to make sure everything was still on track and yet again I was given the run around by the employees and manager Josh as to when my stuff would arrive. Finally he said that yet again its been pushed back to the first week in February. He gave me Ashley's customer service email to send proof of damage and I was told I would receive a call or email concerning the damages as you might've guessed THAT! DIDN'T! HAPPEN!  Before ending our call he said he was going to give me a call the next day at 9:30 when he starts his customer service calls and you guessed it IT NEVER HAPPENED! Mind you we placed our entire order at one time in OCTOBER!!! We were told that there was a 6-8 week wait to receive our stuff which we were fine with because our home would be finished being built by then. It's now January and still were being given the run around. I have never experienced such unprofessionalism, deplorable customer service, and lies by a company who's standards are supposed to be way above par. I am livid and hate that I ever gave this company my business. They care nothing about their customers only about the quick buck that they can get. I wouldn't advise anyone to ever do business with this establishment. Your just another sale to them and they give you nothing but empty promises. If I could've given no stars I would have!

Management was very good.  Prices seemed to be excellent.  Quality seemed to be excellent.  Selection was very good.  The -2 star is because of my delivery.  I paid $75 cash for delivery, which is fine.  But, after all my furniture was placed inside my apartment and the delivery men left, I failed to check to make sure everything was delivered correctly.  The next day I open the box that contained my headboard and it was the wrong size and color.  Management had a new headboard delivered to me, but the delivery man refused to take back the incorrect headboard because he said, \"I don't have the paper.\", so I took the headboard back to the American Freight warehouse.\n\nWithin the next few days, I opened the mirror to my dresser and it was the wrong color.  I took the mirror back to the American Freight warehouse and management swapped it out for me.  In the end, I happy with my furniture but it appears my $75 delivery cost was wasted on my end due to the driving back and forth a few times to fix a few mistakes the delivery men made with my purchase.

We bought basically a whole house worth of furniture, when it was time for delivery they informed us that our sectional was not in stock and that it\u2019ll be in stock in 2 weeks and that they\u2019ll deliver it out to us with no delivery fee but we could still get our bedroom suite that we ordered.\nIncident #1: On delivery day I had to call and ask what time would the furniture be in because we were out running errands. They forgot to put our furniture on the truck and the delivery people had to come back and get it\ud83d\ude44 (I\u2019m sure if I had not called I would not have known)\nIncident #2:Two weeks later, which was on yesterday (Sunday) at around 12pm I called and spoke with OJay and asked was our furniture in. She told me yes(why didn\u2019t they call?) and that they can deliver it out same day. Okay cool. She then called back and said that we didn\u2019t pay all of our delivery fee which in fact when they delivered our furniture the first time my boyfriend gave them the delivery free PLUS A TIP. She then told me that it was okay and that they would take care of it. Later that day, at 4pm, I called again just checking to see what time they would be coming. The guy I spoke with asked would I be okay with getting it delivered first thing Monday morning. Uhh no. (My problem with this was WHY DIDN\u2019T ANYBODY CALL, I would be okay if they had the common courtesy to inform me of any issues instead of me having to call them.) The guy told me my furniture should be at my house no later than 10:45AM(I didn\u2019t know how if they opened at 11am) I asked was he sure and he said yes.\nSO THIS MORNING MY FURNITURE WAS NOT AT MY HOUSE AT 10:45! I called promptly AT 11am and spoke w/ the manger Rodney and he informed me that a driver was on the way to get my furniture to deliver it. If my furniture was not able to be at my house at 10:45AM they should have communicated that with me. I received my furniture at 12pm after all the mess I had to go through. I appreciate it if you guys would be more professional with your customers and communicated more with your drivers.

DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n\nFull story: I shopped at American Freight on Black Friday 2017 with high expectations after reading these reviews. And the experience in the store was fine. No pressure to buy, but a helpful staff answering any questions my husband or I had. We bought a sectional and ottoman set we liked even though they weren't available for delivery for 2-3 weeks. We were fine with the delay and left looking forward to it arriving in a few weeks (more time to find homes for our old stuff).\n\nThat's when the trouble started. Fast forward 4 weeks, no sectional and no call/news at all. I call the store and was told that my purchase wasn't on the truck as expected, but they would be calling other stores to see of they had it and we should hear something the next week.\n\nLife was busy so I didn't check again for another 3 weeks. This time when I called I was told they didn't know why, but it was on back order. But it would for sure be in the next week. I again expressed by hope that it would arrive as I very much looked forward to using my furniture.\n\n2 weeks later, no furniture.  At this point, 2 months after purchasing the furniture and as my husband and I are both active duty military and didn't have the time to go to deal with it, my mother-in-law visited the store on a Friday. She made a bit of a scene stating the facts in front of other customers, and wouldn't you know it our sectional and ottoman arrived on rush order the following Monday. Corners were scuffed in some areas, and a few tears from packing staples, but at that point we were so glad to have the furniture  and tired of dealing with the company that we accepted it anyway. I will never shop there again  and highly recommend you don't either.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bce410ad21f:0xb1653e3c3ad41741"}

However the great reviews must be only for furniture that they have in stock. The couch and love seat we really liked was not in stock and we were told it would be two weeks until our furniture would arrive This was 15th of July. It even said August 1st on the sales receipt.  Two weeks go by and we heard nothing. We called American Freight and we were told that they don't have a date that the truck will show up it will just show up one day. Three weeks out we had heard nothing and we're told it would take 2 to 4 weeks. At this point we would of asked for a refund and shopped somewhere else but their policy states you can get a refund after 4 weeks from purchase.  Now four weeks arrives still no furniture still no date a truck will arrive.  We call on Monday with all intentions to ask for a refund and were told there is a truck and the Manger will be in on Thursday for us to get a refund. Thursday comes no phone call from American Freight we call on Friday and we're told oh your couch is here. Alot of effort on our part to find the status on our order. So after 4 weeks and several days of a family of 5 sitting on the floor since we just moved to Montgomery we have our couch and love seat. When we picked them up we told them we were still in the market for furniture and we were told to come back and they will give us a good deal for being so patient  well why not give us a deal while we were there. We won't be back.\nGoing back to the day we purchased the furniture the couch and love seat we wanted they actually had in the back but it was already sold to a customer who was waiting for it to be delivered some sales people were telling our sales person to just give us that one but we would not do that to someone else. So it puts into question did our furniture arrive weeks ago and they sold it to someone else it's possible especially since they could never give us a date our furniture would arrive.\nWe do like the furniture but if you shop here and they don't have it in stock BEWARE you will never know when you will get it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1471896687656, "text": "We do apologize for the inconvenience, Wes.

When it was delivered, the delivery guy Preston had noticed they sent the wrong chairs but I had noticed the box with the table looked as if it had fallen off of the truck or dropped from a distance. After bringing in the table, they left and came back with the correct chairs. After putting together the chairs, I opened the box containing the table and it had indeed been dropped. It was well after store hours at this point but I still called the delivery guy with my issues. The next morning at 11 sharp, I got a call from the owner. Like he has obviously done before, apologized for it and said that he's send another out by the end of the day. TWO DAYS later, the table finally arrived. They opened the box to make sure that nothing is busted up and I was very pleased with the way it was handled. I was so pleased that we decided to order two more chairs from them. We were told that it took 2 weeks for the chairs to arrive. It was November 27th and we needed them before Christmas. Before they ordered the chairs, we had to pay and that wasn't an issue for us. We paid the full balance of nearly $180 for two Madrid. counter height chairs. Two weeks go by and no chairs. I was told that the truck hasn't come in but I'll definitely have them before Christmas. December 22nd, I gave them another call and I was told that I could pick them up the next day. I was overjoyed to hear that. On the 23rd I got a call from the manager telling me to not come because they wasn't there and he didn't want me to ride there for nothing. He said that he was just have them delivered when they came in. The delivery guy Preston brought to our home at 6pm that night. He told me that they were in a different box because they opened it to make sure that they sent the right chairs because of what happened the first time. Trusting his words, i signed for it then took them upstairs myself. I placed them in a closet, grabbed my things and left home until Saturday night. Christmas morning I pulled out the box, opened it and removed all of its contents. I then took the box to the dumpster. When I returned, I settled myself down to begin assembling the chairs only to find that the chairs HAD ONCE BEEN ASSEMBLED. There were marks on the chairs, the screws were stripped and rusty. and the floor protectors were very worn. There were also four screws missing as well. There were hand smudges all over the wood. There was nothing about those chairs that said NEW. In complete disbelief that Rodney the store manager for charge me full price for two chairs off the showroom floor then have me wait nearly a month to receive them made me a bit irate. Without thinking, I called the store on Christmas morning. After realizing, I messaged the delivery asking for the cell number of the manager and I've yet to receive an response. So as a result, I feel it's very necessary to be waiting in the parking lot with two unassemble Madrid counter height chairs and several questions that gonna require an answer as well as a solution. Until this, I thought very highly of American Freight and its coworkers. Now it's BUYERS BEWARE... there's a reason they say that all sales are finals. For me, I don't want my money back because I do want the chairs. I just want what I paid for and I DID NOT pay for recycled chairs", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1483030131860, "text": "We're very sorry to hear this happened to you, Sylver.

Yes thats right he never showed us anything on sale nor did he bother to ask what our spending limit was so he know what to work with.

Thats when the salesman kinda brushed us away from the actual sofa set that we were sitting on that was 398 and started reverting us back toward that 699 plus tax sofa set. Smh thats not the sofa set we wanted or was discussing.we felt that the salesman wasnt offering us what we wanted but yet offer us what he wanted us to buy.....and we are the customers...its our money not his....we felt like our wants were disreguarded so we decided to check another store, told the guy we were gonna check somewhere else also before we decide. Asked him for a bussiness card and of course he didnt want to give us one and by him doing so gave us even more reason to be absolutely sure that we dont want to shop there now.\nSo as we started to walk out the door the guy then decided to offer us a deal on a sofa set\n...A BETTER PRICE is what he said so im like oh ok he wants to work a deal on the actual leather sofa we were sitting on with the 398 price tax.

He showed me all price point options and demonstrated every feature of each mattress and frame. He was helpful and knowledgeable without being the least bit pushy. I ended up making a purchase of a mattress way more expensive than I had originally planned, but I am confident it\u2019s exactly the model I actually will need and love. Their exchange policy and extra options like warranty service were well priced and explained very well. Delivery charge is about 1/4 of what the other stores were going to charge me.

What made it 5 star worthy was the overall experience.  We came in looking for a hybrid mattress due to all the rave reviews we had seen and heard.  Alex started us off on what I would consider mid grade mattresses.  He took us over to the TempurPedics next.  I know what you're thinking because we thought the same thing.  While the TempurPedic was nice, so was it's price tag.  I compliment Alex, he definitely did his best to try and sell us on that particular mattress.  When we would try others in the store, he wouldn't talk bad about them per say, but he also wasn't singing their praises as loud.  However, once we told him our financial situation he was a complete gentleman about it and began telling us the great things about the mattresses we were testing.  When we found the one we purchased Alex was super complimentary about it and raved about our choice.\n\nShopping for large purchases can be so stressful and overwhelming. I kind of equate mattress stores with furniture stores and car lots.  I don't like being rushed or hassled the entire time, but I do like attention when I have questions or want opinions.  If we had to do it all over again, I can guarantee you we would return to Mattress Firm and ask for Alex.  He assisted when needed, gave exceptional customer service and made the process smooth and worry free.\n\nIf you go to this location you are in good hands and won't regret it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892218e9cd6499:0xd630aaa9cefc29a3"}

I ended up buying a sectional and 4 barstools from him and he surprised me by delivering the stools a day early, with fabric samples for outdoor furniture I was wanting to purchase, but thought I would have to make the hour drive over and back to look at samples. He sent the ones I mentioned to him in an email with the delivery men so I could match them to my current color scheme and  then call and order it over the phone. They have given me exemplary customer service, the best prices of anyone I have shopped with and have earned my business for all the other needs I have for this retirement home.

So they delivered my couch it was painless, I got a loan on it and the service was good. However the bulk of my purchase almost 3,000 worth hasn't been delivered but that's not the whole issue it's the way the store has been acting. I called them 2 week before my delivery was due, they didn't answer the phone. Everyday I called and they didn't answer, stated open on business hours and I even used a different number once, nothing. See I actually wanted to purchase something else but I got suspicious. What business doesn't answer the phone this went on for a while. I finally drove there to find the door locked a new sign that said they are open but the open sign not lit so I knocked on the window because inside I could see a young guy wrapping up all the furniture. Another suspicious thing. He called some guy over and the guy opened the door and said they were remodeling. I went back the same day it just didn't feel right the guy said the last guy moved  to somewhere else he offered me to come in said most of my things already arrived but they would deliver on the due date. Which was fine I asked why they didn't answer the phone he said because they are always on the floor. The phone is cordless and both times I went there the guy was behind the desk where the phone was. Also I seen the guy who originally took my order he went to the back before I got in the store I didn't mention it. All this  would make perfect since to have everything out the store due to remodeling but they just seem fishy two!days before my purchase should arrive I go and there is a note says closed till after the 10 of April due to corona. I'll update my post if they get my furniture a week after that date like they said.  O hope it all turns out well but like I said it it don't smell right.

Our shopping experience was great but as soon as we paid them it went down hill from there. We originally went to just get a new mattress set and decided to go ahead and purchase a sectional as well. They said they had to order the mattress and would deliver it all after the weekend which was no problem. Delivery day comes and I\u2019m 100% sure 1 of the delivery drivers was on drugs as he kept making weird noises and just biting air..... They bring everything in and get it set up and I ask where the 3rd piece of my sectional was and get told oh there\u2019s no third piece it\u2019s a typo ect. Well a week later they call to tell me they found my 3rd piece of my sectional which I then had to drive to pickup myself and install myself once home (for the amount we paid for the sectional I wasn\u2019t happy) Then to top it off our mattress didn\u2019t feel right from day one. It was hard as a rock and killing my back worse than it already is. (We were purchasing a new mattress for that reason!) Well I finally get my husband to move The mattress Around and realize IT\u2019S NOT THE RIGHT ONE. We paid A LOT for the mattress and needless to say I expected the right one to be delivered! They did get my correct mattress to me finally after almost a week and offered to give me store credit or refunded me some of my money. I tried to purchase other furniture pieces with the credit but he was pricing the items way higher then the advertised price so I finally just requested a refund which they did with a POST DATED check! So, needless to say I was worried the funds would even be in the bank. I then find out the owner not only knew that my mattress was wrong but told his employees to give me what they had in the back and not order the correct one! They did that the day I bought it bc after getting everything done my sales lady said oh it will have a different cover on it bc they changed it so don\u2019t be alarmed \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (the correct mattress they finally delivered looks exactly the same as the one in the show room. So no they didn\u2019t change it)  So they knew before I walked out of the store the day I purchased that they weren\u2019t going to send my correct furniture that they were going to send me what they had in the back regardless of what it paid for and hope I didn\u2019t notice. Needless to say I will not be back PERIOD. None of my delivery was correct at all because they didn\u2019t want to order what I needed but had no problem taking over 5k from me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0b825faf4521:0x49c2aedc8f019c0b"}

After speaking with Darwin the salesman we had initial dealt with I was told it was because they only deliver to baldwin county on Mondays and that there was no way to say what exact time they would show up. So if you live anywhere in baldwin county or further I would definitely not suggest doing business with them.

She chose a mattress, applied for credit and was told she had been approved. However, the salesperson told her they could not complete the sale and arrange delivery until she received the actual credit card in the mail. After about 2 weeks she had still not received the card so after a few calls to the store and the bank she was told they would cancel the first card and issue a new one. As of September 21 she still didn't have the card so her son-in-law went to the store with her. They then agreed to go ahead and deliver the mattress on Thursday the 24th. Well, they never showed and also didn't call her. So she called them Friday morning and canceled the order. And they didn't even offer an explanation or an apology. Terrible way to do business and to treat an 83 year old woman.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3fb2fb824c95:0xf5bca07774b687d7"}

He knew the ins and outs of all of the products and answered my detailed questions about how they compare to other popular chairs on the market. He was also well-versed in ergonomics and spine and posture issues. I decided to go with the X-Chair. I think all of the products are thoroughly vetted by Relax The Back and ergonomists.

First off, if Marcus is your salesperson expect absolutely nothing to get done or be done right. I ordered a bedroom and living room set over a month ago to be delivered on June 26th. All of my furniture didn't arrive on time... I still haven't received my living room furniture nor an update on when it's expected to arrive. I finally cancelled the order and asked for a refund yesterday. When my bedroom furniture did arrive, the wrong chest was delivered. Also, Marcus claims he forgot to include my bedrails and I didn't have screws for my headboard. The delivery fee was $100, with no assembly. I had to drive back to the store for my bedrails. No considerations nor accommodations were made for me regarding my time or gas even though this order was paid in full and this was a mistake he made. As of yesterday, he still could not give me an update on the status of my living room furniture. I finally spoke with the manager who was unaware of this situation and told me that my complaint was one of many and that Marcus had been demoted. However, this doesn't change the fact that I've been in my house for almost a month with no living room furniture and they've had the payment in full long before I even closed on my house.

The pricetag was certainly lower than anywhere else we looked, and it looked like OK quality furniture.\nLess than 3 weeks after purchase, the sofa literally fell apart. We're pretty normal sized people and have treated it with care. I turned it over and opened up the upholstery to have a look.  The construction quality is the worst I've ever seen; low grade partical board, half-rotted knotty 1/2\" thick pine, and the whole thing is held together with staples.  I identified 6 separate joints that had come apart inside the couch due to the staples simply slipping out of the wood, and many more that were halfway undone.\nI ended up taking around 3 or 4 hours and meticulously replacing pieces, reinforcing joints with metal brackets and screws, and closing up places in the upholstery which were mysteriously split and leaking stuffing.\n\nThe furniture here is truly of the lowest quality, even if it appears fine on the surface.  If you buy from here, make sure you also purchase their ridiculously expensive warranty (that will tack on $100 - $200 to your purchase), because you're gonna be needing it a whole lot.

After 3 days, we contacted corporate with same results. They told us that they will forward to a district manager and they will call us in a couple days.\n\nThis place is HORRIBLE!!!

Thanks\n\nPlease Be Aware Of This Business\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 SHARE\n\nI purchased a brand new $800 lift chair recliner from this place. I bought it on a Saturday evening and contacted them on Monday to let them know something was wrong with the chair. They would not let me return it. It was under warranty so I had them send some one out to look at it. The guy came week 2. Agreed the whole time that something was wrong with my chair but he wasn\u2019t sure how to fix it. He sent the report to Sabrina\u2019s Furniture Store week 3 and she said nothing was wrong with it. I hung up and called the manufacturer in Mississippi they said the brake for the footrest was not working. Therefore my footrest slowly goes down while sitting in it. They sent me a new motor for it. I contacted Sabrina back and she was gonna send someone out to put it on. So I\u2019ve waited all week and nobody has showed up or called. I contacted Sabrina to find out why nobody has showed up to fix it and she said the system is kicking out the maintenance order. I told her I was tired of waiting because my feet were staying swollen from not staying elevated. I also told her I would bring the chair back tomorrow and swap it out for a new one. She said they were all out of stock. So I said I would bring it back and get my money back. She agreed to it but then wanted to charge me a $200 restocking fee. Mind you this is a brand new $800 chair that has been tore up since I purchased it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862ccc4d6074139:0x7da1f1f052cd206a"}

Andrew was very knowledgeable and asked questions that helped him determine which ones best suited me. He was great and not the type of guy to push you into the most expensive one on the showroom floor. After looking at several different options, he discussed the current specials they had going on. Long story short, we got to talking about us needing another mattress set and that we would be back later because we were so please. I ended up leaving the store with two mattress sets with adjustable bases for a price no other store could even touch. If you need a new set, he is the man to make a deal with.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say is that, I was a little put off by the delivery guys. The adjustable bases we tried in the store were a decent height off the ground. When they set ours up during delivery, they were extremely low to the ground. I questioned them about this and asked does the whole bed let up, because I remember them being higher off the ground. The height was so low to the ground it left a 6 inch gap between the top of the mattress and the bottom of the headboard. Their answer was no they do not make them like that and to just go buy some taller legs at a hardware store or some bed risers from walmart. After they left, low and be hold, I look in the boxes they left and what do I fine? The extensions to the legs they could have been put on when I asked about this issue. So then, I had to go next door and ask my neighbor to help me lift the frame up to attach the extenders. Glad I went ahead and did this, because I noticed they also did not put on the seventh leg at the top. The instruction book stated that this should be put on for king size beds. So now I have one bed with the extenders on correct and one that I still have to get fixed. These frames are too heavy for just one person to do by themselves. Also, I hate that they just left trash under our beds that I had to dig out. Whenever the zip ties and twist ties landed, is where they left them. They did at least take with them the plastic and boxes that the frames and mattress came in.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with our purchase just a little disappointed with the delivery service. Had the delivery gone better, I would have given 5/5 stars. I would definitely buy from them again and recommend them to everyone else. (Hopefully the quality of product lasts a long time though and I don't have too!)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0546bf165a3b:0xcb1d38730a0f650b"}

They had a good experience with the owner/manager Josh Johnson so we decided to check the store out. Our visit went great, we ordered a Stearns and Foster mattress, a couch, and a chair. $1500 including delivery. Josh told us he would be going out to Atlanta the following Thursday, February 2nd, to pick up our couch and chair and have it delivered Friday or Saturday. He'd call to set up the final details. The mattress, however, he could get to us by Monday the 30th. We set up a delivery time for 3:00. Josh stated he would call me the morning of the 30th as a reminder. Up to this point, everything was great. Until Monday the 30th rolls around, it's 3:00 and there's no reminder phone call or delivery person. I call Josh and he asks if the delivery could be changed to 5:00. OK. Fine. No problem. Five o'clock rolls around. Nothing. Six o'clock. Seven o'clock. Finally, after being stood up repeatedly, my husband (the second of the two men delivery...That we paid for) helped Josh load the California-king mattress into the house. My husband is a disabled veteran and large part off his disability is his back. It is now the 9th of February and we have not received a single phone call from Josh about our couch and chair. I've called him nine times. Once while standing in front of him yesterday. He informs me that their number has changed as of that morning. Mine hadn't. He never called me. Though it expressly states, via their own contract, that if there are any shipping or delivery set backs they will contact me immediately to let me know. So, on Monday, February 6th my husband goes to the store to inquire as to what is going on. Josh tells my husband that they're having some delivery issues but we'll definitely have our furniture by Friday. He'd be giving us a call to set up a time. However, by Wednesday afternoon still no call. So, I went to the store Wednesday afternoon and Mr. Johnson tells me that we 'should' have our furniture by Tuesday. When I asked him why he hadn't kept me informed he said he was busy keeping up with his other customers and if he neglected to call he was sorry. I asked him why he hadn't returned my calls when the number has only recently changed. Surely he got them. No. He says he never got a single one of the many phone calls I made. Then I ask him if he has my number. He says he wrote it down wrong. That's funny, because he knew it when he was talking to my husband, and it's clearly written in our contract/receipt. Oh. And he tells me they're getting out of the furniture business. Be WARY, folks. Be VERY wary. All I'm asking for is common courtesy. Keep me in the loop. I'm not unreasonable. At this point, however, if I do not receive my furniture by this Tuesday I will proceed to take civil action through litigation if I am not given a full refund of the cost of the delivery fees, couch, and chair that I have paid.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88f333433646516b:0x4d6a49b20bf770f4"}

If you happen to be unlucky enough to work for bedzzz express in Rainbow City, they will: not properly train you on working in the warehouse. They will not take any time to explain anything. One person knows where each mattress and box springs are located and it is a guarded secret. So when you are there trying to help you have to wait to be told where things are. Then of course you are told that you are to slow by a manager who has been photographed asleep at his desk more then once. Customers who buy from this store sometimes want there old mattress and box springs hauled away for them. These mattresses are then taken to the dump. Except for the ones that the manager wants to take home. He will allow the hired help to take home one, if needed. But then he accuses you of \"selling beds\". Of course the generous, just above minimum wage pay makes it completely unnecessary to sell the trash collected from customers. Unless you are the manager, then its ok to sell the trash. You can also count on hearing every person that works there talk about every body else that works there behind there back, especially when it comes to talking about the manager. I don't believe I can even write some of the things that were said about this man on a daily basis. I don't believe I can write what was said about the customers behind there backs either. This was probably the most miserable place I have ever worked. Every person from the temps to management, hated having to come to work every day. For the most part I simply listened and didn't say to much. I knew if I did happen to speak about someone negatively, the other people working there would run to tell what was said. So I simply didn't join in on the behind the back talking. My honest opinion about this place is that only if you are truly desperate for a job should you work there. The entire environment there is toxic and filled with deep depression, anger, hypocritical management,  back stabbing and misery. Of course they may respond to this review and say I am simply an ex-employee who is trashing the place I worked at because I am mad about being let go so that another ex-employee who quit 4 or 5 times could come back. But no, I am not mad at all, just wanted to let people know how things really are there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a395a5444dcf9:0x498a784f29fb8c63"}

Some place else\u2019s furniture will be made better and I bet their customers service is so much better also.\n\nThey have deleted my other review about things being fixed from previously. The manager at the time did fix the problem. But I made a stupid mistake by buying something else that was more exspensive thinking it would be better, now they don\u2019t want to fix that again a few months back. On top of that I completely forgot to come in and make November\u2019s payments (normally someone would call me between the 1st and 10th just to remind me)(I\u2019m a mother of two and full time college student so I\u2019m forgetful when I don\u2019t get reminders) they called me last week while I was sitting in class so I asked them to call me back in a couple of hours to discuss why they had called. Didn\u2019t think nothing of it. Well today I got a letter in the mail saying I was avoiding them and refusing their calls (which I have not I answer every phone calll that comes in because I never know if something might have happened to someone) then the \u201cnew manager\u201d tried to say she delivered this letter to my house today. This letter has a stamp on it has been through the post office lines and was in my mailbox at the bottom of the box(I haven\u2019t checked my mail in three days so it was full) but she proceeds to tell me that my account which as of today is 30days late it wasn\u2019t 30days late when she sent this letter to me. That she would be sending it to the court house this week. And that she would not work with me because I\u2019m 30days late as of today. That this was policy after 30 days. I worked at this store in 2017 for a while and they normally don\u2019t send to collection until 120 days or later. She also tried to tell me they have been calling I have not received but that one call from them a little over a week ago when I asked them to call me back and they never did then my grandmother received a call from them last night and she told me today when she seen me. So hearing this plus receiving this letter today I did call them only to be told she wouldn\u2019t work with me. I also know that when I worked there and I would help the collector there to make calls you can just click in the computer saying that you called when really you didn\u2019t. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay her right now Christmas is a few weeks away my sons birthday is also the week of Christmas and my car payment is due this week so I offered to pay November and December\u2019s payment on December 28th the Friday right after the holidays she then told me I would have to pay court cost and do it that way because my account wouldn\u2019t be there any longer.\n\nI have been dealing with farmers for a couple of years now and I always pay my accounts off wayyy earlier than need to be.\nThis is also the first time I have ever been more than two days late on making a payment. I understand they want their money, but sometimes things don\u2019t work out like that so they should really work with someone who has never been late like that.

However, while my wife and I were discussing whether we wanted the Kincaid chairs or another brand that we saw at another local store, the owner came up and told us that we either needed to buy the chairs from him or not use his showroom to go buy them from someone else.

No personal contact.  Received an email with instruction that I must go to the local business and handle the replacement through the local representative. I went to the local store and met with a very nice gentleman named David Paffumi.  Mr. Paffumi handled the exchange and scheduled a pick-up of the damaged mattress and set a delivery date for the exchange.  The manufacturer (company headquarters/people in charge) still need to place more importance on Customer Service.  I really appreciated the concern that Mr. Paffumi demonstrated in helping us get this matter resolved.  The management of Mattress Firm would do well to take some lessons on Customer Service from Mr. Paffumi.  My original rated of one (1) star has been changed to three (3) stars.  I hope the exchange goes well.\n\nWOULD RATE ZERO (0) IF POSSIBLE!\n\nExtremely poor Customer Service after the sale.  We will never purchase another mattress from this company.  They are all about making the sale, but after that you will not receive any support if you have issues.\n\nWe purchased a brand new Sleepy's Hybrid Firm mattress including adjustable electric frame and more.  A little more than $2,000.00 worth of products.\n\nThe mattress started bleeding through the cover with some sort of dye.  We contacted the local sales office and they immediately told us they could not help us with a warranty item and directed us to the manufacture.

She had the door locked during normal business hours, open sign was on and all the lights were on in the store. After myself and three other customers kept knocking on the doors and windows and she would not come to the door, we became concerned for her safety. We all called the store repeatedly and no one would answer. We finally called another store to see if they could get in touch with her and she would not answer for them either. That store manager finally called their district manager who called the store and she finally answered. About 10 minutes later she finally came out of the back room appearing like she had just woken up. She immediately opened the door with an attitude and stated \"someone is trying to get me in trouble calling my district manager, I was here by myself and in the back room\". We attempted to tell her given the area and the fact that all the lights were on, open sign was on and that we noticed a car parked there that we were concerned for her safety. She continued with the attitude. I told her that there were 3 other customers there who had left and she replied \"well that's their problem, they can go somewhere else\". We told her 5 times what we were looking for and she repeatedly asked what we needed. We finally left, only to be chased out the door by her stating \"ya'll see I was here....my car is parked right there. There was no reason to call my boss and tell him I wasn't here\".  I again told her that we were just concerned for her safety and she continued to run her mouth at us outside the store. Well, to me if you were there then you should have had the door unlocked and certainly shouldn't have had the attitude you did with me about the other customers leaving. I personally would appreciate someone being concerned about my safety if I did not come to the door after repeated calls and knocks on the doors and windows when we clearly read that the store was supposed to be open. I  did get a call back from the District Manager, Bruce, who was very nice, and thanked us for being concerned about her safety even when she was not appreciative of that to us. I took my money elsewhere. I see other people have good reviews about the store, and maybe this was just a fluke, but it was a very odd situation to say the least.  I was also told by the District Manager that she has caller ID in the store, and that is likely why she answered his call and not anyone else's. I am only giving one star for the fact that the District Manager called me back and was very professional, apologetic and appreciative of my concerns.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3ec7efea06c3:0x11e4dd951231ecfa"}

During the sale the salesman said many time if we find a better price else ware, let them know and they will refund the difference.  I went home, went on the MattressFirm web site and realized I paid over $70 more than the web purchase.  The salesman said he would refund the difference (which they did 3 weeks later).  I then went to a local competitor and found the same mattresses for over $300 cheaper.  I went back to the salesman and he told me they were not the same mattresses.  He said the memory gel was \"better\" on his model.  A little background here, Serta make mattresses and different retailers put different names on the SAME mattress.  This is the case here.  MattressFirm named the Serta Mattress \"Kozma\" where other places named it \"Kellerman\".  It is the SAME Mattress.  I even called Serta Corporate and they confirmed.  I commented to the salesman that it would be more advantages for me to give MattressFirm the $79 to come and get their mattresses and then purchase them at the other retailer.  The sales guy called me \"an extortionist\" and I politely said it was about getting the best price on the SAME mattress.  Once I mentioned (in email traffic) that I would be contacting Serta Corporate to see if the were the SAME Mattress, the salesman said they would refund me $300 more on the sale (which they did 3 weeks later).  Here is what MattressFirm WON'T tell you.  They will only match ADVERTISED  prices of their competitors.  They will not honor quotes.  The ONLY advantage to purchasing a mattress from MattressFirm is that you can give them $79 to come and get the mattress if you absolutely hate it.  Here is my advice.  DO YOUR HOME WORK.  Compare the specs of the mattress you want and then shop around.  On a good note (hence the 2 Stars), we LOVE the mattress.  Very comfortable and this is a customer that was sleeping on a Tempurpedic.  4 Stars for the Mattress.  1 Star for my sales experience averages to 2 Stars.

I Know there are so many issues with production and shipping that i was willing to wait since every furniture store in mobile, Baldwin and the USA are dealing with the same thing. A coworker decided to get a large amount of furniture from Lagniappe back in May and i simply fell in love with it. So my friend brought me in to the store for a girls day. Number one, we were greeted asap! I am huge on customer service so from the start I was pleased. Number 2, the sales lady allowed us time to view the store ourselves and didn't hover over us. I appreciated that. Third, eventually our sales person got a little tied up and that was perfectly fine so this tiny little southern bell manager came over and quickly helped. Honestly, she was so kind, helpful, informative and extremely knowledgeable about shipping and production times. She told us up front, that special orders are running up to 20 weeks right now. Like i said, i was already aware of this and if i didnt want to wait, there was no reason to design furniture but i know what is going on right now in the usa. Plus, we already have furniture that we are using until ours comes in. The furniture selection was outstanding! best quality and best price for the money. We had went to hanks 3 weeks ago and they had zero furniture in stock and told me it would be 30 weeks for incoming freight with them. I was pleased to hear \"up to 20\" with Lagnaippe. This is on \"special order\" merch. They have plenty of other sofas, loveseats etc in stock. They just do not stock specials order things which, i dont think anyone does actually. I ended up ordering my things and i was happy to hear that i only had to put 50% down and i could pay the rest off when it comes in. That was a huge help since my husband and i just had our wedding a few weekends ago and i am strapped for cash now. The customer service, quality, the staff, even the check out counter was just the nicest people. I am not from the south so it was just the sweetest talking to these true southern bells. our sales person was great and the manager Mrs Ophelia was precious. Let me say this, if you are looking for in stock furniture \"LAGNIAPPE HOME STORE\": IS THE PLACE! If you want to design your furniture, please be considerate and understand that it will be a minute before it comes in. My husband just left a factory 3 months ago because the stress was too much. These factories are the ones delaying your furniture, not lagnaippe home store or any other store. thank you lagniappe home store for being so kind to me. I hope this review helps your customers understand what's going on. I have seen customers scream at retail workers over delays due to covid and its absolutely disgusting to me how anyone acts that way over furniture! Things are not back to normal at these factories. there are bigger things going on in the world and more things important.

We lock the doors at exactly 5:00 working 9-5 is long day. They did stay to let him pick up the chair he paid for 11 weeks ago and was told no one would help him load it because you know we absolutely have to lock up at 5:00, god forbid we stay open an hour extra minute for a customer. We got it home and it was missing bolts. Wow ! They kindly left the bolts outside for him to pick up.We wouldn\u2019t dare want to put out the all mighty manger at this story again. My Dad lost everything in a house fire and this chair was a huge deal to regain some sort of normalcy and rebuilding a home. We will never shop here again.

Sue also listened to me the entire time and directed me to exactly what i was looking for. The whole store was extremely positive in many ways. Mitty who is also a great sales person helped me pick out fabric for my special orders. Lagniappe home store probably has hundreds of fabrics to choose from may i add.. Sue also did a house call for me too! Lagniappe home store has free decorating services which is awesome! When i got to the customer service counter, the store manager Ophelia and the office manager Megan were two of the sweetest girls I have worked with. They made everything easy for me. I purchased a lot of furniture, some in stock items, some special order items, home decor etc..There is nothing i am not happy with. I even got the extended warranty which is something i am glad Sue and lagniappe home store offered to me. I received several courtesy calls as i was waiting on my furniture and they let me know everything.  I will continue to always buy from Lagniappe home store. I am very grateful for the excellent customer service i have been given the entire time from start to finish. To the owners 'Kevin & Tonya Booker, Sue, Megan, Ophelia, the delivery guys, all the sales people and all, thank you kindly for treating me so well. I will spread the word about how well the customer service, the prices, and the good quality furniture Lagniappe has. I also want to add, that next wed which is Sue's off day actually, she will be coming back to my home for another house call. That means she is coming to  my home on her off day. What employee that you know of does that? That means Lagniappe home store's employees care that much about their customers to make them happy. You know, it really does take everyone to make a company work and thrive together. I can see, that is exactly what goes on at Lagniappe. The whole store welcomes everyone as soon as they walk through the door. So you get amazing customer service, the top prices in Mobile and Baldwin county and furniture that will last for years.

I told salesperson I needed furniture ASAP as I was currently without.  The furniture I chose had to be ordered.  I was told it would be a 4-6 week delivery time.  Six weeks being the absolute worst case...most people get it between 4 and 5 weeks I was told.  So at 5 weeks I call to check.  I was told due to Hurricane in NC it was delayed but would still be delivered within the 6th week.  6th week I was told it would ship on Oct 1.  On Oct 1 I call to verify that it did in fact ship.  I was told and I quote, yes, it is on the truck and will arrive at our store by Tuesday the 9th or Wednesday the 10th.  I was a bit shocked it would take 10 days to drive from NC to Al but whatever...\nOn Tuesday the 9th I call for an update.  Again, I am told it shipped on the 1st but they didn\u2019t have an update of where the delivery truck was!  At this point, I have lost all confidence that they know anything about customer service.  My husband goes into the store on Wednesday the 10th and asked for manager.  He was directed to the lady who handles delivery, the same lady who verified not once,  but twice that my furniture had shipped on the 1st.  She asks who told me my furniture had shipped!  She begins to say my furniture had not been constructed yet because of the storm...not the one in NC last month, but the one that hit  Florida today!  So my furniture that I ordered almost 8 weeks ago, paid in full, has not been started because of a storm that comes to another state 8 weeks after you took my money?  My husband asked for a refund and was told no refunds on custom orders.  He said if it hasn\u2019t been started yet there is nothing to cancel.  They issued a refund only to say it will take 48 to get the refund back in our account.  Withholding information from customer is nothing more than a fancy lie.  You knew each time I called that my furniture wasn\u2019t coming but you continued to lie.  I can\u2019t find one positive thing to say at this point.  I sincerely hope you change your policy...I will warn every person I know what you did to me.  Shame on you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43ef73885afd:0xf326f30c166a179f"}

As I moved thru the store I was given cold water, an info card and my personal space so there was no sales pressure. Overall a very relaxing experience! I bought&ordered the items and they were ready to be picked up the following day! While setting up the sleigh bed I ran into a few missing pieces (!!) I called the store fairly frantic and they were able to tell me exactly where the feet of the bed were calming me down in about 2 seconds lol.

Ms. Pettaway chose to do an in-house lay-a-way payment option and put half of the total purchase amount down. We typically do not process in house lay-a-way orders until its paid in full, but we went ahead and ordered the set to try and help her out. Deniscia called to check the status of her order on Saturday March 13th , I, Krystine told the customer we had not received the order yet, that due to COVID, manufacturing has slowed down, which prolonged our delivery on inventory. This is actually an issue we've been patiently having to deal with, as a vendor during the pandemic. It typically takes about 2 weeks from when you pay it off in full, and we would get in contact with her once we received the order from the manufacturer. Ms. Pettaway then called back 20 minutes later with a third party on the phone, at which time both parties proceeded to yell at me using profane language. I explained the situation again being as polite as one can be when faced with someone yelling and screaming on the phone.\n\nI, Krystine, spoke with Deniscia again on the 17th, 19th, 22nd, and again on the 26th when the order had been delivered from the manufacturer. I , Krystine offered the Denescia free delivery for the inconvenience of having to wait on the order despite only putting down half. When the customer came in to make the final payment, I said \"Hello, How can we help you?\" She told me she was here to pay the final payment on the order. I then asked if she wanted a refund because after speaking previously Ms. Pettaway said that she wished to cancel the order and get a refund. Upon making the final payment we arranged for our delivery driver to deliver the products to the customer free of charge.\n\nDeniscia called us Saturday March 26th saying the boxspring was broken. After speaking to Ms. Pettaway, her mother called us yelling, calling us names etc. We asked Deniscia to submit photos to us so we could file a claim with the manufacturer so they could warrant the workmanship of the product. Upon reviewing the photos, Josh noticed the boxspring was upside down and called Deniscia Monday March 29th to let her know the issue was an upside down boxspring and that the manufacturer warranty would not cover damages that the customer caused by putting the foundation upside down. Despite knowing that, Josh offered to come over and fix the boxspring for Ms. Pettaway on his free time to rectify the situation. In response, he was told, there was nothing we could do to make the situation any better and that the customer would leave constant bad reviews.\n\nWe kept in constant contact with Deniscia, speaking to her 5 times in the course of 3 weeks. We worked with her by splitting up the payments and even ordering the set despite not having received full payment. We also provided free delivery for the inconvenience of having to wait. A full refund was also offered to Deniscia who refused it, finally we offered to come over and repair the boxspring for Ms. Pettaway on our free time.\n\nOnce the customer and third party became combative with the use of profanity on the phone with us, the phone call was terminated. Our policy when a hostile work environment arises, is to remove ourselves from the situation. We have offered Deniscia Pettaway several different solutions in order to solve the problem and move forward successfully.\n\nWe have exhausted every option in order to appease Ms. Pettaway in an attempt to rectify the situation. There is nothing further we can do to make Deniscia satisfied despite the countless options given to her.\n\nFurthermore, we stand behind our process and our policies and are confident we did everything in our power to have a successful outcome."}, "gmap_id": "0x889c175fd00c2a63:0x8f737bc346918443"}

If you're husband knew anything about measurements and the mattress business he should have known that your mattresses wouldn't work! We didn't know there was a difference but then we are not in the MATTRESS BUSINESS! As for the contamination issue those mattresses are hauled over the road and god knows where else before they even get to your store!! We never even unwrapped it so there is no way we contaminated any more than it already probably was. Also you nor your husband made us aware that once we bought it we were stuck with it! I nor my husband remember seeing any signage stating that policy all we saw on the walls was sport memorabilia!

You specifically told Josh you needed a mattress that was 60x80 (which is a standard queen mattress).  Josh asked you multiple times if you were sure it would fit your space, you were very adamant about getting a queen mattress today and reassured him a queen size mattress is what you needed. We did not have any measurements other than those that you gave us, as a we did not measure your space, you did. Our return policy complies with Mississippi state laws, in that we cannot accept returns because of a contamination policy they have in place. Also, we explained this to you on the phone and you asked us to do something unethical and take back your mattress, that had been inside your home. Once you became combative with the use of profanity on the phone with us, the phone call was terminated, because our policy is when a hostile work environment arises we remove ourselves from the situation. We are sorry the measurements you took weren\u2019t accurate and the space doesn\u2019t fit a standard queen size mattress.

I have never even done reviews because it really depends on the day and person every where but this place is HORRIBLE!! First me and my husband bought an entertainment center and had to send it back 3 times for being damaged. The last time there was damage but you couldn\u2019t see it that bad so we just kept it. We should have learned our lesson then!! The next time we bought our daughter a new bedroom suit and we bought a new kitchen table. We knew it was on back order for the bedroom suit but the table would be in sooner. We were called when the table came in set up the delivery time. On the day of Delivery for the table our time was 2-5, at 5 when we had not heard anything I called the store. They gave me a number to call the delivery guys because they said they couldn\u2019t get ahold of their delivery guys. I\u2019m not sure how a customer was supposed to get ahold of the delivery guys before the actually store but I called anyways. Of course no answer. Called the store again and the manager just kept telling me he didn\u2019t know and to have my husband call him. Why do you need to speak with my husband when I\u2019m the one calling?? My husband called and we were finally told they found the truck but we need to reschedule the drop off! Nope we will not we need it today! Me and my husband went to the store and picked it up. We chalked it up to understaffed due to covid and left it at that although still upset the manager will not talk to me only my husband. Now for TODAY! Manger called my husband (although he has my number) told him all the furniture would be in on Tuesday. Rather then wait around on another pointless delivery fail we said we would go in today on Thursday to pick up the furniture. My husband goes in and\u2026. The manager said the furniture is not there and they can\u2019t find it\u2026.. WHAT?!?!? Are you kidding me?!?!? My husband calls me at work at this point I\u2019m done I\u2019m furious I call up there to see what\u2019s going on and the manager says YOUR TO UPSET I CANT TALK TO YOU! I WILL ONLY SPEAK WITH YOUR HUSBAND!!!  I have to call my husband (because I\u2019m at work and can\u2019t go up there and deal with it in person like I would like to) he has to call the store. Blah blah they offered him the furniture on the floor but the dresser is cracked! Are you kidding me no I\u2019m not taking a cracked dresser after all this nor would I take it before all of this.He tells my husband he can come get the bed and nightstand we will have to wait on the dresser of course . We said since that is our only option it will have to do but we will NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER buy from this store and I\u2019m going to corporate about all that has happened and how the manager here has a problem with speaking to woman!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb33dd87097c5:0x750da89af599d5ef"}

After what I experienced in the store I\u2019m confident it will be worth it but this review is solely on the store. Never thought I would enjoy shopping for a mattress and certainly never dreamed I would spend th money we spent but the staff never once made me feel pressured. Tika was our tour guide and I use that term because that\u2019s what it was a guided interactive tour. There was another gentleman working with her who was very friendly but I don\u2019t recall his name but from the sounds of it his customers were enjoying the experience as well. There\u2019s eight different models with various thickness and materials and they let you try out every single on of them but the first setup was our ultimate choice. It was really amazing to watch the screen above your head. You see your pressure points in real time and can see literally see your optimum sleep number. If your considering a new mattress don\u2019t let the prices scare you away from Atleast experiencing it first hand. I never dreamed I would spend more on a bed than I did my last used car but as a sufferer from chronic back pain I was willing to make the investment after visiting this store but again never felt pressured by the staff.

The mattress felt so good, I didn\u2019t want to get up and start feeling yucky again which is the reason I asked him to bring the paperwork over to me.  My cousin and my friend with me tested a mattress too. I think my friend who has trouble sleeping will buy a mattress soon.  I purchased her a curved pillow and a wedge.\nI am also grateful for the patience and kindness shown to me.  Saturday was my first day out of the house.  Johnathan did not know this, but my older brother died January 24, 2020 of metastatic cancer. I took leave from my job to take care of him. I am still in shock. He died three months after his diagnosis. Johnathan made me laugh.  I didn\u2019t panic or experience any anxiety.

We discussed the issues I originally posted below.  He listened intently and worked to rectify the situation to retain our business.  As such he took action to truly \"make it right\" per his reply.  Unfortunate that the situation occurred however we are now in a much better place.  Thanks to Austin for following through on his word.\n\nBad experience.  We recently purchased a Tempurpedic set and was originally told it would be delivered within 10 days.  We were also told that the store would keep us apprised of the status.  Well, no calls were received after a few days so I called.  I was told by a \"floating\" manager it would actually be 4 to 8 weeks.  At that point we perceived that we recieved bad information from the salesman who sold us the set. Frankly, I feel as if he told us 10 days to prevent us from taking our business elsewhere.  I informed the \"floating\" manager to call by 1000 the next day and if they weren't going to honor their original timeline to refund our money.  Note that they cashed and deposited our check for the full amount.  I never recieved a call the next day.  So I called the store and spoke to Brad- our original salesman.  He then stated that mattress would be at the warehouse on the 10th day but deliver later in the week.  Unacceptable.  I was going to be ok with it until Brad spoke to me very aggressively during our conversation. Even at one point trying to use \"I am a Christian angle...\" which had nothing to do with thr situation.   I had enough and told him to refund me.  He was supposed to call back and let me know when the full refund would be returned- never did.  Moral of the story is buyer beware.  Also, if you decide to go in and Brad is there be prepared for him to talk your ear off about random matters that have nothing to do with your reason to be there.  Recommend taking your business elsewhere where you have a better chance of not dealing with a used car salesman.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1612147842712, "text": "Hi Josh, we are sorry you had a poor experience with us but we would like to fix it if we can.

In one instance I had taken my 87 year old mother to buy a mattress and box springs at the Whitesburg Drive store. The staff was very helpful even to the point of when  we arrived one of their employees came out to help her climb up the stairs. At that time the employee didn't even know if she would be a customer at their store. They just came out to be helpful and offer assistance. Once in the store they were very helpful, knowledgeable, and took a lot of time with her. After her purchase the delivery crew was very professional as well.\nI bought my adjustable bed frame from the South Parkway Store. My in-store experience was mush the same as I described. The delivery crew was also friendly both times...the first time they came they didn't have the hardware to attach my headboard. They returned the following Saturday and attached the headboard and made sure that I was pleased with the installation.\nWhen the time comes again to get another mattress my first stop will again be Bedzzz Express.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532052910058, "text": "Wow Robert!

This store really needs to evaluate their customer service skills and improve by taking care of issues in a timely manner.\nInitial Review:\nHorrible experience! Do not shop here! They sold us defective furniture that damaged our hardwood floors and no-one returns the calls. The delivery men were still at my house when I showed them the sofa was reclining and digging into the floors! The sofa reclined and left a deep two-foot-long scratch in our new hardwood floors. They replaced the sofa on Dec 31 and I showed them the loveseat is lopsided. They tried to fix it but couldn't. It has been over three weeks and these people do not return your calls nor stand behind their products! Don't shop here! I wish I had read these reviews before we shopped with Farmers!
