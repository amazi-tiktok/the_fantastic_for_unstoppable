The guy that brought it out, dropped it off and handed him a paper to sign.  So apparently that paper said that it had a full tank but my husband didn\u2019t get time to confirm it.

Oh, and i was late getting it back with no extra charge.

Not sure if that policy is still the same but I will find out tomorrow i guess. Coming down to rent a skid steer and dump trailer if you guys have one.

{"user_id": "104693508538894411256", "name": "Bryan Carmean", "time": 1494633175881, "rating": 2.0, "text": "I have rented on 3 separate occasions from Valley Rental & up till today I could have honestly provided 5 stars. I was always treated with great personalities and their equipment is adequate  with great rates. However, after today I can honestly say I will never rent with them again and would advise other DIY\u2019ers to steer clear. The issue is that there is no way to hold the company accountable if there's an issue. Unlike Robin Rents, United Rentals, etc the buck stops at valley so if the owner disagrees with your personality then you lose.\nI rented a small mini backhoe to do some yard work for a 4 hour overnight rental with the intention of possibly keeping it for the weekend. Unfortunately the equipment was rented out  with no working brakes outside of the hydro static system itself. With that being said while attempting to switch from low to high gear the tractor got stuck in neutral and began to run away out of control an was unable to reduce the speed due to a complete absence of a manual functioning brake. This quickly escalated into a very bad situation which forced me to dive the back hoe bucket into my asphalt driveway (scoring It indefinitely) in order to prevent a potential disaster on a 3k plus lb. piece of equipment.\nNeedless to say I am not one to complain which is where I messed up. I received a call this afternoon from Ross who asked why the tractor was not returned @ 0900. This immediately infuriated me as I had explained the day before I would likely be keeping it for the weekend. The situation got completely out of control after explaining the incident that had occurred with the faulty tractor. To be fair he was prompt on offering a mechanic to come look at the unit but protested my explanation of the brake system and pointed blame. To make matters worse they literally had to call the local Kubota dealer to verify the brake system characteristics. I found this out by calling Kubota myself to verify this myself and was informed by Kubota that Valley Rental had them. After this I decided I wanted nothing more to do with their equipment and lies and called to have them just pick up the tractor and be done with it. Upon contact another argument took place with myself and Ross which led to Ross cursing and using profanity at me and hanging up the phone after stating he was sending someone to get his tractor. At this point I have no idea what I am even being charged and no one I can talk to verify how to resolve this issue as the GM himself will just hang up on you. All in all I find it very frustrating that there is no way to hold Valley Rentals accountable for their actions. The problem is at the top and not the solution like larger rental facilities that you can hold accountable. They did by no request of myself refund a portion of my rental (1 hour of use and 3 \u00bd gallons of fuel to be exact). They did not even offer to repair the driveway and Ross never apologized for his professionalism & disrespect & I of all people know professionalism being a 10 year disabled combat Vet. Honestly, the majority of Valley Rental is spot on. But with situations like these customers can be taken advantage of and have no avenues of recourse. All in all I say rent at your own discretion and hopefully nothing goes wrong because if it does your on your own. Otherwise be smart and rent only from organizations that can and will hold themselves accountable for their mistakes and lack of communication.\nI assume they will rebuttal against this review, possibly even with an apology from Ross. However, if the GM wanted to correct the issue it would have been done prior to me posting this review and in a timely manner. At this point an apologize given due to a public review is nothing more than an attempt to discredit the review and salvage other/ new  customer relationships that may be harmed by my sharing of a real world experience in order to prevent others from experiencing similar stressful & unsafe situations", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1495052869452, "text": "Mr. Carmean, we are very sorry you feel the way you do. We believe the entire situation could have been avoided with better, calmer communication.\nOn May 11th, Mr. Carmean rented a mini backhoe.  He had informed the counter that he was paying for a half day/overnight rental and that he might extend out to a day to 2 days.  His rental expired at a half day at 8am and, as a company policy, we reached out to see how long he wanted to extend. This communication upset Mr. Carmean, to an unreasonable degree.\nAt that point, he informed us of the situation that occurred with the brakes of the mini backhoe.  As he described his situation the first conclusion, based on the information given, the machine was put into neutral and gathered speed going down a driveway and the parking brake system, which is used to hold the machine in place, not stop it when going that speed, did not stop the customer.  We then stated that we wanted to check the machine and wanted to send a mechanic out to make sure the machine was safe to use, per company policy.  We simply wanted our experienced mechanic to inspect the machine and determine what was going on.  These are hydrostatic machines and are not meant to go downhill in neutral, taking the machine out of the hydrostatic operating system and forcing it into neutral, to gain speed, can cause harm to the machine, and most importantly, the operator.\nWith the situation and Mr. Carmean, calmed down, our mechanic in route, the customer called the local Kubota dealership and asked if Kubota machines had brakes. Without knowing what machine the customer was referring to, the situation that occurred, etc.  they answered with a general statement of, \u201cYes, Kubota machines have brakes.\u201d  The customer then called us back and was irate again calling everyone liars.   We were informed, by our Kubota dealer, when Kubota tried to reach out to him again, from someone actually in service, not just someone answering the phone, that Mr. Carmean would not let the Kubota Service manager get a word in and continued to verbally abuse him as well.\nIt is our company policy to educate our customers on the use of a machine before we allow them to leave our store with it. On the back side of our rental agreement, we address the inspection of the equipment, use of the equipment and the customer\u2019s responsibility in an of emergency or equipment malfunction. Mr Carmean agreed to and signed this contract. Despite the fact, he did not follow our guidelines regarding the proper usage of the machine or the guidelines when an accident occurred, we did not charge him any extra and actually refunded him for the time he did not use.\nWhile we don\u2019t like to have unhappy customers, as we base our business on customer service, we also won\u2019t allow customers to verbally abuse our staff."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626ccd09d65d83:0x5440ec2d9e1b3282"}

The employee further told me that their delivery truck would be there on Wednesday. He seemed to indicate the truck would bring newer dated batteries. I left my name and number but never got a call. The following Monday I visited the store again and spoke to the same employee. He checked and said they didn't get any newer batteries in. He said he was going to the Alexander City store that afternoon and would see if they had a newer battery. He again said he would call me either way and let me know. I confirmed that he still had the note with my name and number. And again he never called. I sent an email to AutoZone's national website regarding their lack of customer service. They replied and said that my email was being forwarded to the district manager and that I would be contacted within 24 to 48 hours. That didn't happen either. I sent a second email to AutoZone letting them know that the district manager never contacted me. They said my second email was also forwarded to the district manager.A day or two later the district manager finally attempted to contact me.

Took my 6.0 LQ4 block, crank and heads to have them reworked, cleaned and check to see if they were still within spec limits. We discussed engine gaskets rebuild kits. I left and then called on the phone to discuss more pricing and gaskets again. I went back to stewarts to bring some more parts to be cleaned but on that visit talked again about rebuild kits and gaskets. Now each time i talked to the owner about the gasket sets i asked, were they felpro? his answer every time was yes they will be felpro. He gave me a price which was little more then what i had search online for but i decided to go with his kit since the gaskets were definitely felpro . well is snowed the next day and roads were closed so i had to wait another day for him to finish. roads were still bad so he came in late but he was finished around lunch time. So when i get there to pick up my parts i ask where is the rebuild kit. The machinist shows me the box and the gaskets sets are not felpro, they are Victor reins gaskets. I refused to buy the kit because he told me a they would contain felpro. The machinist told me that felpro and victor reins were made by the same company that they were the exact same gaskets. That was his first lie too me. Those are two entirely different companys, with different pricing and materials. so we deducted the kit and now i owe for the machine work done, which is 345.00 I pay the balance go home and start unloading the block and notice the cam bearing that they installed for me were damaged from the installation too. Took it back and the owner said he doesn't know any other way to put those bearings in. well duh!!! but you don't damage them when they go in , if you do damage them then you take them out and install new ones. but they sent me home with that crap. so i decided to look over the heads real good since things are already not good. well the heads are aluminum heads , they look as if someone took a wire brush to clean the mating surfaces on the heads. they are scratched badly. there are several scratches going across the from one cylinder to the other which will leak when it is installed back on the block. So i took the heads back to stewarts this morning and asked to talk to someone about this and the owner wasn't there but the machinist was. so i showed the head to the machinist and asked what he did to it. he said he milled it. i asked is that acceptable? he said yes. i asked if he could show me any where in writing, online or any mechanic that can tell me that those scratches on the mating surface of the head was acceptable .The machinist looked at me and said pick my head up and get the hell out of there. You can imagine what my response was. :) but I'm not happy with this and the place of business is just horrible. I have been building engines for over 23 years and i have never seen anyone tell me that scratches on a aluminum head was acceptable to install. They refused to take of this and now i have to take the heads and have them resurfaced if they can even be resurfaced again. i also heve to take the block and crank to another machine shop to have them check and correct everything stewarts touched. BEWARE SHOTTY WORK AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. STAY AWAY if you want good work performed.\n\nYour Desired Resolution:\nAt this point all i want is a complete refund for the services they performed. I tried to go back to talk to them and i was told to get the hell out of their store. The work performed was bad and i don't fell comfortable letting them touch anything else of mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cb974de7cfd5:0xb07e55d35fc40cf9"}

Told us we bought \u201ccheap brakes\u201d and needed to buy the $64 ones instead. Then I try to just try to return. There was a customer in front of me taking a while and offered to let me go ahead. The worker refused. Then when it was my turn, I tried to return the brakes. The worker spent time trying to look up the part just to reiterate that it was the wrong part. I told him I wasn\u2019t even purchasing new brakes, just returning those. I told him at least 10 times I bought it from Hoover. 5 minutes later he refused to return the wrong part because I didn\u2019t purchase it at his store and stated \u201cI wish you told me that sooner\u201d.

Writing this while waiting for rain to let up so I can see how to drive to another auto place, not Auto Zone, to get wiper blades. I hold AutoZone responsible for failure to do their job if something happens. If people start doing their job & held responsible maybe things will get better in this world, And if you can  pay them better, they do a better job", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601069211716, "text": "Thank you for letting us know about your experience, Tamera.

(Employee)\nDate of incident: 2/20/21 - 4:30-5:00pm.\n\n\ud83d\udd25Bought a refurbished starter from there a few years ago. Returned it because it went bad and had a warranty. Did not want to deal with another refurbished starter, so I requested a brand new one. Was told they cannot get a brand new one which is fine. So they told me I could return the defective refurbished starter I had for a refund so I can use that refund on buying a new starter from another store. At that time, that particular employee was real helpful and kind to me.\n\nThen the incident on 2/20/21 happened when I returned on that date with my defective starter. was dealing with the store manager Mike and his employee Thomas D. at the time. I was told that the starter needed to test bad in order for me to get a refund which is fine, because I had my mechanic test the starter beforehand and I recorded a video as evidence. After waiting a good few minutes because it seemed like something was wrong with the machine, the store manager Mike comes out and says that the starter tested good, but that he would still honor the refund. I told him that's fine, but the starter should have tested bad because my mechanic already tested it and I watched him test it, so I pretty much told Mike that the machine is to blame, then he got defensive and rude with his tone of voice about the machine clearly stating that the machine was not incorrect. To avoid further debating, I directly said to just do the refund. His attitude regarding the situation was unprofessional and unacceptable.\n\nWhat makes the situation even worse is the fact that the employee Thomas D. asked me for my driver's license on returning the defective starter which should not have happened, because I have my receipt. When I asked him why he's asking for my driver's license, he said they were supposed to do that on returns, but that's obviously not true. Something didn't feel right, so I called another advance Auto parts store about the situation and that store told me that advance auto of Enterprise were in the wrong for taking my driver's license. My driver's license has the address to my Mother's home because it's an old address and I am not comfortable with that address being on file because I'm protective of my mother and concerned for her safety. I do not trust people I don't know, and I definitely do not trust that advance Auto parts store anymore and ever again.\n\nThey acted very shady and I felt discriminated because I'm part Asian. I've been shopping there off and on for years for myself and for my Mother. As of now, I am no longer a customer and I want my information out of that system immediately. Yes, I got my refund, but I shouldn't have had to go through that much trouble to get it, or feel that uncomfortable. Everything that happened that day was pretty much recorded on my phone along with two eyewitnesses that were with me in case I need them for future reference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617481519561, "text": "Hello KJ, thank you for leaving your comments about your visit to our Enterprise location.
