The motto is suppose to be serve and protect, but needs to be changed to harass and bully. Having 5 police cars park about a quarter mile away from a 65 speed limit sign and pull over so many cars knowing that the citizens are going to go the speed that they see is just harassment. Instigation should also be illegal for police officers to do. If they are really doing this to keep the citizens \"safe\" how about putting up more speed limit signs? rather than putting up traps. Shows how busy our police officers are when they can have 5 cars just waiting on people to give tickets.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f5794f11df:0x673d610eec7d0ffd"}

All injuries she received at work from a severe mechianary accident. Needless to say my mother and grandmother wanted and needed to see her. So I went and got my grandmother with alzhiemers from her home. Anyway, monday just after 12 I got to my mother's house where my grandmother was staying with her. I helped get them get loaded in my mothers van, which would be much easier to travel in than my 2 door mustang. I drove them to visit my aunt, their sister and dauther. I helped get them loaded back into my mother's van along with my aunt and her wheelchair this time and took them to visit some people we go to church  with that they haven't seen and really missed. After getting back to my aunts house from visiting, I unloaded my passengers and helped them inside. Inside someone from church had made food so we stayed for dinner together. So around a little after 10pm my mother was ready to go so I loaded everything back up and drove from Morgan County where my aunt lives to Owens cross roads where my mother lives and dropped her off at home. She was worried because of my terminal illness I had pushed myself to hard that day and insisted I had to talk with her on the phone my entire ride home back into Huntsville. She didn't want me to be sleepy and drive. Keep in mind though this is getting close to 11pm and I haven't been in my car since around 12 noon. So I hop in my carand cranked my Mustang. I turned my lights on and start heading on my way home to Huntsville. Before I get pulled out of the subdivision I get the call from my mom and we talk while driving home. As I am driving through Owens Cross Roads my left head light goes out. I thoght that's weird so I switched my lights off and on real fast thinking maybe it was just some glitch. The light came back on for a short duration and went back off. Since there wasn't much traffic at all this late I turned my bright lights on when I could without blinding people. Like any other law abiding citizen I was afraid I may get pulled over for this. So I prayed I would make it home without any trouble so the next morning I could go get this light fixed. I made it into Huntsville and less than 2 blocks from home when I saw a police car behind me. I told my mom I needed to let her go and before we could say bye I saw the police lights. So I got pulled into a shopping center. This lady ,Officer Peterson, walks up and says my head light is out. I tried to explain what happened and the steps I was doing to try to be safe and how I was already planning to get it fixed first thing the next day when businesses reopened. She was not concerned with any of that and interrupted me asking for license, registration, and insurnace. I get out my license and registration noticing another male officer pulled up and was back there talking to her partner. As I'm pulling up my esurance app to show my insurance id cards I mess up my password forgetting I needed a capital letter. Before reattempting she orders me to give her the license and registration and then walks off with them. I got my card pulled up immediately as she had stepped away and was flashing my phone out of the car to let her know. To my surprise she comes back awhile later with 2 tickets 1 for improper lights and 1 for failure or refusal to display insurance. When I tried to ask questions I was agressively interrupted and shut up. I tired showing her the insurance card and she refused to take saying it wasn't legal I needed a paper copy. Again she was agressively shutting me until I was afraid to say anything else so I took my tickets and left. I hate when cops like that give other good cops that kind of reputation that's why I left this comment in great detail. She abused her authority, broke the law, and intimidated me into silence.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f5794f11df:0x673d610eec7d0ffd"}
