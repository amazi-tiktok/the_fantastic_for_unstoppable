But today my fryer don\u2019t work again, I called up there and ask for service, they just told me can\u2019t do any service for us no more, I asked why is there any reason to make y\u2019all to do this to me? They just kept saying sorry we can\u2019t do any service for you no more. I don\u2019t really understand so I questioning him why? He told me he don\u2019t want to argue with me, just they don\u2019t service us no more. Wow..\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. First, we never yelled out anybody . Second we gave you guys credit card info to trust you guys to charge us for service. Third the last time service which is couple days ago he couldn\u2019t find the problem for the fryer So I asked him before he leave what if the fryer stop working again, he told me just call office for service. Then I ask him how about the charge? He answered he will not charge me this time but he doesn\u2019t know if his boss going to charge or not. So I will just say thanks to him because I knew there is a fee for came out.  But I don\u2019t think I will have a problem with you guys to collet the bills. You might need to talk to who came for the service first. Maybe they were lying for some reason.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598041798733, "text": "Mr. Chen, as we explained we can no longer render you service due to the fact that on multiple visits to your establishment we have had a difficult time getting paid for our services and our technicians and dispatchers have been yelled out on each occasion. Our rates were explained in advance and the technician clearly explained what was needed to repair the equipment prior to doing the repair. We were given the go ahead to proceed with the repair, but when the repair was complete the technician was told he would not be paid for the parts or service. Therefore we can no longer provide service to you. We will not send our technicians into that environment again."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bb81677b8e1:0xfb06d9389264bcb7"}
