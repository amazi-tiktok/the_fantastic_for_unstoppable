This was the first time we had used a tax service since moving to Alabama. He was efficient and had us out with a good refund. He also gave us some tips for next year and what we needed to bring when we start our business for next year. Highly recommend these guys.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88863675d0f1cea1:0x4b2a44eca2c11af3"}

Mark and Bill are top-notch! They are the best at what they do, they try their best to get the most amount of money back to the American citizens from the IRS while at the same time they allow the Americans to pay their fair share of taxes. They know all of the ins and outs and I know the IRS. I wish most Americans had these guys on their side like we do. I have been going there for years and I feel confident that they are doing the best I can for me yet at the same time they are following the law. usually when I go to have them prepare my taxesthese guys on their side like we do. I have been going there for years and I feel confident that they are doing the best I can for me yet at the same time they are following the law. Usually when I go to have them prepare my taxes there is a long line of people waiting. For some reason I left up today and they said that I got there just after the rush had left. I was in and out in no time. Especially thank you to Bill, he has been there preparing my taxes for my family for many years now. If you're looking for some good tax guys Mark or Bill are where it's at! Downtown Fayette Alabama.
