To safely scan a patient with one of these devices, proper monitoring must be performed during the exam, i.e. pulse oximetry or electrocardiography.

I was in and out in a short amount of time--- no waiting at all.  The x-ray tech and the young lady who did the Doppler were very nice and both seemed very knowledgeable.  However my experience this week was horrible.  I notified them on Monday that I had just been told I needed an MRI. I  specifically requested they perform it because they were close to my office and I had a good experience the week earlier. I said I must get the MRI by midnight October 31 as my insurance changes.  I was told \"no problem\"  -lots of openings.  My physician faxed over the order and my physician had a confirmation that it was received.  I asked the imagine center if they would get a pre-certification for it and they said they would and that they would contact me to schedule. I heard nothing else on Monday. Nothing Tuesday.  Wednesday I called again.  They said they did not get the orders.  I called my physician again and they were re-sent.  My physicians office even the centered and verbally verified that they were received.  Still I heard nothing for the remainder of the day.  I found out later that they left a message on my home machine for me to call (never tried my cell --or my work number) .   I called again today and was told my orders were not specific enough and that a pre-certification was needed.   I attempted to tell them that I had asked that do it.  The office manager immediately came on the phone, was very rude and unprofessional. She preceded to tell me how I needed to call my physicians office and get them to call the center and get the specifics.  I re-enforced  kept saying that I really need to get this today.  Bottom line I did not get my MRI before my insurance changed.  A total lack of communication as one employee is leaving a message on my home phone to schedule and it will not be anything out of pocket while another employee is on the phone with me telling me it will be $1600 total.  They can't do the MRI today but would be happy to schedule me for another day at  $1600 out of pocket.   What would have been zero out of pocket for me will now be $1600.  Am I aggravated and disappointed? YES!  I called and asked that my orders be sent to me so \"maybe\" I could find an open all night MRI facility somewhere and get the MRI taken care of.  The office manager refused to fax the documents to me.  I was told that they could only fax them to another physician.\nThey were my records, a fax is HIPAA compliant but they still refused even after I offered to sign a release.  The office manager is incredibly rude and there does not seem to be communication from one employee to another.  I am very disappointed in them and will most likely never visit their facility again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862135369467bad:0x1c361c22c3e1dc44"}
