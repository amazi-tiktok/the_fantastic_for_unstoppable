Why would you say that?! At least respond acknowledging that you saw it because the receptionist doesn\u2019t believe in answering the phone! Also, they WILL try to downplay your resume regardless of experience or if you have degrees. They try to put you in an irrelevant job to your current experience or try to give you an $8-$10 job! Lord forbid you ask for a higher pay because then they definitely can\u2019t help you and will come up with some bull like \u201cwe\u2019ll have to discuss your resume with the manager and see what will best fit you.\u201d They are hard to communicate with and once I told Sarah what I was trying to do or look for she sent me a text for other job agencies and never contacted me again! By phone nor email! Express, do not give me this cookie cutter response saying Sarah is one of your best recruiters because obviously that\u2019s a lie! You all are use to dealing with people who just walk in the door who aren\u2019t dressed for interviews (and i have witnessed this on my way out the door!) and act like they never had any home training so you treat everyone who comes in the door like that!

These people in this office have no idea on how to do there job must less set other people up with employment. First off if you come in the office dressed professional and with a resume in hand as I did all they will do is have you put the same information in the computer and scan your resume. Then will tell you all the jobs they have for you is general labor job which is only fit for mans. They have no jobs for any woman and they don't have anything for a person with a bachelor's degree. I have walked in this building three times with my resume in hand and each person sitting at the desk doesn't do anything but act like they are looking over a resume then says I will give it to the manager. They will hand you the business card after that plan to NEVER HEAR FROM THEM AGAIN IN LIFE. Recently I tried to call about any job opens and got the runaway from a manager that has no idea what her staff does and just put blame on her blame. She didn't apologize for the situation or her staff and then started telling me how I should act on a phone. I'm a customer and clearly the manager/stuff has no customer service. A good manager knows your staff is a regular of you and your training. CORPORATE NEEDS TO COME DOWN AND FIRE EVERYBODY IN THAT OFFICE ASAP. IF ANYBODY IS LOOKING FOR A GOOD TEMP AGENCY PLEASE CALL LABOR FINDERS AND ASK FOR MR.WILLY. HE WILL HELP YOU IMMEDIATELY.

More than any staffing agency I had been to because for some reason, they act like giving employment info is a secret and you have to be initiated first to get any help. Brian made me feel like he was actually interested in helping me find employment. The Registration process was easy. I came back the next day to complete everything because I had an appointment. I meet with other staff members Shannon and Johnny. They too were friendly, kind, and professional. Just like Brian, with them, I also felt like they genuinely wanted to help me. I haven't felt like that about a staffing agency in a VERY long time. While I was there, I also noticed the way Brian interacted and talked to other job seekers that came into the office. The same way he treated me, with respect, professionalism, care, and a positive attitude. That really won me over and stood out in my mind. I also followed up with Sandra over the phone and she displayed the same professionalism that I encountered with the other staff at Elwood. I was blown away! She was so helpful when I called. I truly recommend Elwood staffing to any job seeker that is looking for employment. They really make you feel like they care about helping you when you walk in the door.
