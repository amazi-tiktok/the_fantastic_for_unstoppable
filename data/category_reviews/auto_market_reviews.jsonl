The car had 0% oil life! Once I did that I needed a new water pump , Also I soon discovered  my 2014 Chevy Cruze had a oil leak as well..\nthen the thermostat went out , I had to replace the battery all out these things came of my pocket with in 2 months of having the car\nalso while maintaining my car note and car insurance I\u2019ve never been late or missed any payments due to the fact I work to pay these bills. I\u2019ve only had the car 5 months and here goes the motor just gone out..\n\nwhen we recall all the problems this car had and I was fixing it every time something happen the mechanic and I agreed that it\u2019s been a problem with the motor he also told me Chevy Cruze\u2019s had a recall on their motor!!\nThe dealership never told me this! The mechanic did , now here iam 2 week later without a car , a rental , no communication from the dealership or warranty company just nothing I\u2019m paying to get my car looked at  I\u2019m missing work and I have to do everything alone every time I call GENE HE TELLS ME TO CALL TROY!! Finally I called TROY just wanting to get help with my car getting fixed by this 2 year warranty i supposed to have  because once I sent it to real good mechanic they told him I didn\u2019t have a warranty!! That  I was supposed to have & they don\u2019t know anything!! I had to find the warranty number alone and when I get Troy on the phone he\u2019s \u201csick with COVID-19\u201d so I guess that means hang up in my face because he\u2019s not feeling well BUT NEITHER AM I!! I\u2019m a 21 year old women who pays her bills on time and have to get to work!!  I really need my car due to me having two jobs and was responsible for getting myself to work. I feel like I bought a lemon!! Well proofs in the pudding my advice to upcoming buyers... TAKE A MECHANIC AND LET HIM TEST DRIVE IT !! It\u2019s only one person at Langston motors that tried to help me during this process and that\u2019s Troy daughters she\u2019s a angle and I thank you so Much for trying to do what you can to help me!!! I really appreciate you the most!! Thanks for everything!\n\nSincerely, A angry black women.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888925d27e10c40b:0xcd531219c197cc25"}

The local companies killed my car, so I traded it in. When doing so JEFF practically tried to scam me.

Well we thought we did. The entire time \u201cMojo\u201d showed the truck, we discussed the motor as well as the other features. Then when we sat down and talked numbers, he presented a piece of paper comparing it to all the other 2016 model F-150s within so many miles and my fianc\u00e9 noticed the motor was listed different than every single other listing,\u00a0so he asked \u201cthis may be a dumb question but this truck\u2019s motor is listed differently. Is that just the way you guys typed it up? Is this truck a twin turbo EcoBoost like the rest?\u201d Mojo replied with \u201c yes exactly\u201d. So we moved forward and we bought the truck. That following\u00a0Sunday my fianc\u00e9 went to look under the hood at something and after some research he found out\u00a0it did not have the 3.5L EcoBoost motor. He called the following \u202aMonday morning\u202c and talked to Mojo. He stated said \u201cmojo do you remember us talking about the truck being an EcoBoost and showing me the comparison sheet of the surround F-150s,\u00a0and I asked about the motor being an EcoBoost, even though it didn\u2019t match up to everything else and you told me yes it is?\u201d He said \u201cyea, yea I do\u201d then My Fianc\u00e8 said \u201cwell Mojo it\u2019s not an EcoBoost. It\u2019s a plain V6.\u201d\u00a0His response was. \u201cOh $@it\u201d. He then said he would talk to management and get back with him. My fianc\u00e9 called him two different times that day. One telling him that he\u2019s still trying to talk to management but they\u2019re busy and the second time was 8 hours later and all they were willing to do was give us an oil change. Both responses were via\u00a0text messages. He would not answer a phone call. So we then called and spoke to a sales manager and he was nice but didn\u2019t have any more to offer. After a couple weeks we were finally able to talk to the sales manager that was working the day we bought the truck. At this point we were over having to deal with them so we settled for a few oil changes and floor mats since the truck didn\u2019t come with any. He stated \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be cheap mats\u201d. Once they finally came in we went and picked them up from the dealership, and they were universal Riverchase kia mats that no where near fill up any of the back seat floor board. We bought better ones from Walmart than the ones they gave us and he only gave one more oil change than the original one. We find this to be highly unprofessional and unsatisfactory. There are thousands of dollars difference as well as the evident performance differences. I\u2019ve also bought a brand new Kia from them in 2017 and it\u2019s crazy we get treated this way after spending so much money with them.

I was surprised they would try to sell cars with such obvious problems.\n\nFor some reason the prices are not on the used cars and the salesman didn't know them. This led to a lot of back and forth in to the computer and back to the lot. We would have preferred more transparency and ease in locating a car.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

Then told me it would take about an hour to get a tuneup and an oil change. An hour and 20 mins passed  and I went back to advise her of the time frame and asked for a copy of the diagnostic print out that was done and she told me I would get it when I check out. I advised her of their sign and commitment to the customer and her only answer was I told you it would be a couple of hours and you said you would wait. I stated a couple was two and it's now going on 4 hours. There was no compensation for THEIR MIX UP AND MY TIME, NEITHER DID I RECEIVE A COPY OF MY DIAGNOSTIC REPORT.

My lights were flickering on and off in my 2014 KIA Soul and I was scared to drive at night. My warranty was about to expire and I wanted to get my lights checked out. Early August 2018 I drove over to Riverchase KIA early one morning and I told them what was going on with my 2014 KIA. I also needed and oil changed. I waited over an hour for the shuttle to drive me to work, the shuttle drive did not know I needed a ride and HE was super nice!! I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash.

In that respect, I wish ratings could be separated for sales and service as I have never purchased there.\nThe Service Manager is horrible to deal with. He doesn't return calls, he indicates his technicians are incompetent and only he knows how to do things. The service advisor that checked me out -not my SA - told me I was being charged for services never done in the past, except for the fact that my last service was there and the prior one was where I bought the car last year. After more than a month of waiting and being told the SM wasn't in/available during afternoons, etc I called and actually talked to the SM. He ask me to bring it by so he could check. Nothing the techs and advisors talked about with the SM were ever done by the SM. He doesn't care. I honestly feel bad for anyone that works for someone that has to constantly put their employees down since he is the only one that would know how to do anything.\nWhen I stopped by he was very rude and even told me in front of a group of people while hanging onto my car door I wouldn't be happy without getting something free...I told him I would be happy with an actual call back. My car is under warranty, and the SA had even told me she would reach out to a used or new car sales manager for assistance since she wasn't able to get a response (they have no control over service but she was trying). Rating mid level or lower doesn't matter on service reviews, no inquiry then either. After I left, I called the dealership to speak to the GM. I had to leave a message which to this day hasn't been returned.\nThe advisors were not the same ones from my previous visit. Maybe high turnover? Either way, consider another dealership for service. The previous advisors and manager were easy to deal with, albeit I have no idea on the work part not being done as mentioned by new SA. I took my car by the dealership near my parents the same day I saw the SM and they were flabbergasted - that dealership indicated that issues would have came up amd be evident if it hadn't been serviced correctly.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My lights were flickering on and off in my 2014 KIA Soul and I was scared to drive at night. My warranty was about to expire and I wanted to get my lights checked out. Early August 2018 I drove over to Riverchase KIA early one morning and I told them what was going on with my 2014 KIA. I also needed and oil changed. I waited over an hour for the shuttle to drive me to work, the shuttle drive did not know I needed a ride and HE was super nice!! I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash.

Wednesday as I\u2019m driving home, oil light comes on and smoke from under the hood. I made it home and found oil leaking from under the car. I call Wednesday to make an appointment to bring my car in on Thursday to be fixed. Thursday I arrive around 8:20 that morning and drop the car off so I could get to work that I was already late for. I called them around 1-2pm the evening to check status of my car. Season stated they hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet and it was being sent somewhere else were it would be checked out in more detail. So they put me in a rental covered by them. They called Friday afternoon and said my car was ready and I asked why was it leaking oil and they said the plug was stripped and that it wasn\u2019t a Kia plug. If the technician knew the plug was stripped why did he put it back on there, regardless of if it was a Kia plug or not. Also, Wednesday when I came to drop the car off, I told them that I would like to get the recalls fixed on it since I already had to drop the car off. I asked the person checking me in did he need the recall papers that I had gotten sent in the mail and he said he could look it up by the VIN. Saturday morning I come in to pick up my car and ask them for diagnostic report on what was done on the car & they tell me about the plug and I asked were the recalls fixed and they said it wasn\u2019t any notes about a recall needing to be fixed. The guy that checked me in Wednesday stated he didn\u2019t remember me saying anything about a recall and he was sorry, Season said they would get it in to be fixed because of the situation but they normally do not do recalls on saturdays. I already knew that because of the previous Saturday I came in for the oil change and asked about the recall. So I guess the pros would be that she did say they would fix the recalls but cons is that I still have to sit and wait on my car on something that they were supposed to had already done. I also spoke with Tim the supervisor about the issues that I was having. I am stuck in a hard place because Riverchase Kia is the only Kia dealership in Birmingham, and I don\u2019t want just any person working on my car and thought I was doing the right thing by bringing to their service center.

However, we did have a male customer who purchased a vehicle in 2012, then tried to trade it in last month. We had issues with getting him financed due to private matters that we don't feel comfortable with sharing on a public platform, as it involves sharing personal information regarding the customer's employment. At RiverChase Kia it is our goal that every customer leave our dealership satisfied with their experience, so we would like to discuss this matter in further detail if the aforementioned customer experience is indeed what you are referring to.

He was so sweet (I almost want to put that into satirical marks) while we talked through wait periods. Good family guy who is proud of his kids and was very generous in his compliments to my husband. This was fine. I would have left a 5 star review with just that interaction. He didn't seem to push us into anything particular or expensive because we knew what we wanted and he knew that too. To be honest, my husband knew more about the cars on that lot than most of the salesmen at the store. To be even more honest, we had no intentions of buying a car that day, but we were talked into it. Not a horrible choice, but not my optimum choice at this time. In the end I wanted to make my husband happy and get a hybrid because it is better for the environment and because we commute a lot. I would have waited a year or two before doing this, but that is out the window now. However, all of that isn't the issue. While we were there, everyone was nice. Stayed there for almost 5 hours getting paperwork done and waiting to be approved for a loan. We're young and like to talk, so we didn't mind. We get a fair interest rate, seeing as how my husband just came out of bankruptcy. This is good. We sign all the contracts, my husband haggles about the extra warranty. All of that is good. We hand over the keys to the car we traded in, clean it out and into our new car, etc. All of the contracts are signed, everything is good. We leave HAPPY. Very happy. Extremely proud of our car.\n\nThis is when things start to go bad. I get a call a few days later because they lost my husband's pay stub. No problem. He sends an email with a new one. This apparently isn't \"clear\" enough \"for the banks.\" Alright. So he sends another one, a PDF copy as clear as day. A human mistake happens and he misspelled Stan's email (missed 1 s). A week almost goes by and I haven't gotten any calls, and neither has my husband. We think everything is fine so we forget about it. Not to mention, it is the end of the semester for me, so the only thing I am worried about it getting homework done, studying for exams, and emailing people from my school email. This, however, is where some of the blame falls onto me. I had gotten 3 emails from Stan on the 4th and on the 5th. The email on the 4th was fine. It just wanted a new copy because he couldn't find an attachment (because of the mess up earlier as my husband was at work and had just made a human error). The third and last email is where I am taking away 3 stars and am very upset about. It is added into this review, untouched outside of cutting away unnecessary bits of the screenshot of my computer screen. Seeing as how the place is a business, I find no issue with giving away the details in this email. In my opinion, I find the tone of the email to be very unprofessional, threatening, and rude. He could have called (in my call logs I received no calls from him and neither did my husband). Calling would have resolved the issue immediately because any decent person would have realized the mistake and apologized and immediately resent the email correctly with the attachment. Yet, it is okay to threaten to take away a car. And I get it. The bank is putting on pressure to get the pay stub or else they will back out and that is bad for the dealership. However, WE weren't the ones who lost the original pay stub in the first place. WE weren't contacted in a more timely manner about it via phone call. Instead, my junk email just so happened to get checked by my husband yesterday while he was handling other business on the phone and he sees all of the emails. He resends what needs to be resent, and now we wait to see if any other \"problems\" will arise. Will our signatures be unclear next and somehow void our contract? Will they try to repossess our car because of any other errors on their behalf? Only time will tell.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

I took it to Walmart Service the next day and had better results.\nToday, we took it there because my wife's car had a recall on it. They told us they were also going to change the oil for free while we wait. While we were in the waiting room, a lady comes to us with a \"Hyundai / Kia In Cabin Air Filter\". She said this is your In Cabin Air Filter and it needs changed. Well, a year ago I did change that air filter with a Fram In Cabin Air Filter. So immediately I knew she was lying to us. I even checked to make sure when I got home that the Fram Filter was still there and I wasn't going crazy.\nDo not do any business with these people. They lie!

Let me provide you a little setup for my situation that this amazing dealership managed to turn around for me. End of 2014 my old Saturn (yes, the car dealer that went under) with its cracked suspension was traded into a dealership that I thought was reputable. Well put you in a new car they said, don't worry about your credit they said, I end up in the most manual of manuals; roll down windows and all Versa Note. Alright, I can turn this around, I tell myself, they said come back in a year and well get you in something nicer. Year rolls by, go back, \"Nope your credit isn't good enough, you got money to put down? Nope, then cant help you, try again next year.\" Alright, so I continue with this car that I am not happy with, upgrade jobs, still upside down in this car years later. Now its December 2017, still upside down in a car I am not happy with. I hear a jingle on my radio, you all know the one, \"We wanna see yea at Riverchase Kia.\" My wife and I talk and decide lets take a chance, what have we got to lose, if we don't like it we can always walk away. I do my research, and go in with an open mind, telling myself I want one of two vehicles. Optima or Forte. I park at the dealership and out walks one of the best, brightest, and positive salespersons I have ever met. Mr. Lionel T. Lee. I had time to stand and stretch on this cold winter day when he greeted, us. I was not set to meet anyone in particular but I am so glad I met this man. He took us to his desk and talked to us a few minutes about our situation and our plans, asked what I wanted and within 15 minutes he came back. He broke down my station for me but did not send me away.\n\nI am a negative person here folks, of course I was thinking everything had gone to hell and I was just wasting mine and his time, but Mr. Lionel was positive, he said, \"I cannot get you an optima, but I am going to get you in a new car. Trust me. I have the perfect one in mind too. How do you feel about a forte.\" My mind went everywhere but I tried to play the shrewd buyer, I said sure I would be happy to consider if the price is right. And off he went again, another fifteen minutes and back he was to grab his scarf, \"Oh you guys are in for a treat, wait here!\" Five minutes later I was asked to walk outside and man was I blown away! The Forte was beautiful, I mean pearl white, leather, backup camera, you name it it was in there. I was speechless, he asked what I thought, take a seat, get a feel for it because man this is going to be your car. I know it. I sat in it and never wanted to leave, going from a manual base to this luxury model, you know I almost drooled a little. He asked, \"What do you think, anything you want to change on it?\" The only thing I could think, \"Got it in Grey or Silver!\" He just grinned and said, \"Yeah, I sure do. Wait here.\" Exact same model, color I want, hasn't even been an hour and I am test driving the car I could not be happier with! Then the standard numbers talk goes by, no one likes this part but I will state for full disclosure that I was in the negative over 6k on my old car, I was expecting that I was going to have it a little rough but you know it was not nearly as bad as I thought. The discounts were amazing, in fact I walked away an hour later one of the most satisfied kia customers, keys and paperwork in hand and taking a picture in front of my new vehicle. Thank you so much Mr. Lionel for putting up with all my negativity and fighting for me to get me in this new vehicle. Hell I sat in it all day yesterday just playing with all the new toys and features, you are an amazing salesperson and even more so just an amazing person to help someone like me. Thank you again! We will be seeing you again next year to get her out of that jeep!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My car died during the ice storm, and I HAD to buy a car.  Here are the problems I observed:\n\n1. 12 salesmen standing out front, half of them smoking cigarettes... certainly not illegal, but it just automatically makes any business look really bad fast.  Plus, they obviously overhired, maybe to motivate car sales by putting more hungry vultures on the lot.\n\n2. I dealt first with a guy named Adam.  He was nice enough... the sales manager obviously sensed my hesitation, so he swooped in and began his \"Pushy sales guy\" mode.  At one point when I started to get up and leave because I felt uncomfortable, he told me I promised him I would buy a car from him if the numbers were right for a used model.  I wanted a new car.\n\n3. Don't even bother looking at the prices of Kias online -- when you get there, everything is 5 to 6 thousand dollars more.  See, that's when they offer you the $6,000 trade in on any model.  Then, they'll act as if they're such great guys doing you such a favor.  It's ludicrous.\n\nI went directly to another dealership, found a car I liked at a reasonable price, and drove away happy.

That was annoying to find out weeks after the fact and that they hid it from us. But the big issue is their service. It is impossible to make an appointment for your \"free\" oil changes. When you do arrive they push a pkg that's like $65 so you can get a tire rotation and other crap. Then when you pick about charging that much for the \"free\" oil change they say, they'll take the oil change portion of that off the top like they are doing you a favor. Then they claim you need a new filter or something or other, which they changed at the last oil change 5,000 so I ask how often that's needed and they claim it's needed every 10,000-15,000 not knowing we just had it done the time before.

We were up front with him on the financials that we had and the monthly payment we need to stay around.  My wife was looking for something older with many more miles, but I wanted to have something that had warranty and miles to a minimum.  Teddy brought us a single option, The Right Option.  A very low mileage Sorento with transferable warranty.  The test drive sold it to my wife, and I signed the line.  We got an extremely well kept Sorento, with a detailed one owner record review by Teddy.  He answered the questions we had and some that he knew we should ask but not know to.  He was easy to work with.  He was knowledgeable  and we are a family with a great ride.  The experience was great, our turn around time for paperwork was minimal, our satisfaction was at the maximum.\nThe entire experience was better than I expected.  They treated us very well.  They earned my business.  I will recommend Teddy, when people ask about my wife's new Sorento.\n\nJosh Akins\n2/17/2018", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

I understand she have to tell me the fee etc.. but my car is only 2yrs old, and at that moment I didn't want to hear about money, I just wanted professionalism and just let me know it will be OK. I just said make me an appointment for Friday and I will come back. I went back Friday morning and spoke with a pleasant young woman by the name of Season. I think that was her name, b/c it was a unique name. She told me the SAME thing the other lady stated but in a different tone, and made me feel as though she cared. She even let me know by the car being new it may be covered under warranty. I told her my husband can get a gauge to ck it etc.. And she said if we do all that then it's still not working then it's likely a issue that will be fix with no out of pocket expense. I took my car back home again, and my husband did ck it Sunday, and the gauge showed Freon in the car, but stated to take it to the professionals. I then took off work Monday and brought my car back and Season's was there also.. I was happy b/c at this point I was just tired of going into circles. She let me know it may be a wait and was honest about it, and the fee again. I waited 2hrs, but I didn't care b/c I wanted my air fix, and to top it off it was under warranty. Anytime you are dealing with something that is a touchy subject about your car, b/c that is your way of survival and also getting around.... you want people to be knowledge of what's going on, and the situation.
