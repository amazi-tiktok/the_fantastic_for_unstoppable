We set a high standard for ourselves in serving our clients & we're sorry that this was not met in your interaction with our business.  We strive to be as clear & transparent with itemized pricing on our service envelopes detailing parts, labor & totals along with a detailed description of work to be done as to remove any chance of surprise at pickup.  Regarding your visit, we created two separate envelopes because we provided two different services, one pair of earrings with 18k protector backs & specialty posts & one pair of earrings with 18ky screw posts & screw backs.  On each envelope, we included an in-depth description of parts & labor needed to complete your job along with the total.  Each envelope had a total written & differing totals ($257.10 & $300.70) due to different mechanisms.  We DID obtain your signature on each envelope as acknowledgement & confirmation of the details regarding the services BEFORE we proceeded.  We understand that your complaint is that our 10 yr. sales professional, Santana, did not give you \"the grand total verbally\".  It is very typical for a client that may want to pick up their services independently from one another, i.e.:  $257.10 one week & the $300.70 the next week.  Although we may have fallen short with \"verbally\" providing you with the grand total, we were completely transparent with our detailed written description & totals for each signed envelope.  We do value you as a new customer as well as your other family members & hope you will reconsider visiting Jewelry by Design in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

I walked into Jewelry by Design with my custom made, one of a kind engagement ring. It has 4 bands that meet in the back. My engagement ring had cracked where the bands meet and one of the bands had broken off. I still don\u2019t know how it happened but I was devastated so I took it in to get it repaired. I took it to Jewelry by Design because of all the great reviews and because the original jeweler was now retired. When I took it in, the service was great and I also asked to resize down 1/4 size because it had been fitting loosely. My first indication that something wasn\u2019t right should have been when they didn\u2019t check to see if they agreed that I needed it resized. When I came back for my ring, I could no longer put it on my finger after only going down a 1/4 size and they had bent the bands causing the halo for the diamond to be out of place. It no longer looked like the same ring and the setting for the diamond was crooked. I went back to them the next day and explained that I believed somewhere in the resizing process/repair that some of the bands looked a little out of place and asked if they would be able to fix it. I also brought a picture of the ring to show how it looked originally. The jeweler at this point was incredibly rude and even asked if the picture was of the same ring. I then explained to him that it was and stated again that this was a one of a kind ring and that it did not look like the picture and also didn\u2019t fit. He then proceeded to tell me that I had not needed to get it resized in the first place and didn\u2019t understand why I had gotten it resized. He also said that he had only done work in the back so anything that was messed up in the front was not his doing. He walked away at this point and his sales rep picked up the conversation asking if we wanted it resized. I said yes and that I would like it fixed to look like the picture. She relunctantly asked me to send the picture to the store email. I was charged more for the resizing than I had been originally and they told me it would take a week to resize it. I should have at this point taken it elsewhere but I wanted to give them a chance to fix their mistake. A week later I got a call in which the jeweler said that he had gotten it \u201cas close as humanly possible to the picture.\u201d He also said that the ring was unstable and that it needed additional structural support insinuating that it was poorly designed. My fianc\u00e9 picked up the ring and much to our disappointment and frustration it looked nothing like the picture. The 4 bands had originally been crossing and now they were parallel to each other. On top of that they removed the 14k gold stamp from the inside of the band. I hope that doesn't mean that they used some other metal when they resized it. I don\u2019t know how he thought that it looked like the picture. I have shown several friends and family members the before pictures and what it looks like now and they all agree that it\u2019s not even close. To make matters worse he added tacks to the ring saughtering the bands together. This was not part of the original design nor had we asked for it and he never called to ask before he modified the ring. The jeweler was again very rude to my fianc\u00e9 when he picked up the ring making comments about how the design was unstable and insinuated the damage to the ring had been some how done by my fianc\u00e9 between leaving the store and giving it back to me 10 minutes later. We believe that our poor treatment was due to our college age and that the piece was from another jeweler. The jeweler who had created our ring had designed most of my family\u2019s engagement rings, had been in business as a family for over 80 years, and was highly respected as a master jeweler for his unique design and pieces. So to anyone who has jewelry designed by another jewler or who is young do not go to this establishment because they are extremely arrogant and have no respect for you or your jewelry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

Its a great place and if I ever need jewelry or jewelry repair I will definitely come back to this man's store each time.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ac22cdf9ab:0x326aa123f09b2c11"}

I was a bit upset to find that the original ring I had ordered for my husband was not in stock in his size, resizing was not an option due to it being an online purchase.  These amazing ladies calmed me right down and showed me some gorgeous rings, turned a stressful situation into a very happy one.  Little did I know that I would fall in love with the rings that Genevieve showed me.  She has an artists eye for detail.  I described my husband and myself to her and she worked Magix by creating the perfect combination of rings for us.  I couldn't be happier and they are so much more beautiful than my original choices.  Trixie, your customer service was impeccable.  I can't thank you enough.  The two of you created an amazing dynamic that made sorting out an issue into a wonderful memory.

When you give me a credit card I expected to be a credit card you don't walk into JCPenney's buy $500 worth of clothes and have to give them $60 in advance you swipe your card you sign your paper and you leave.. what Jared is doing is not giving customers credit cards there financing the jewelry like you with your car or your house but they don't tell you that upfront.. so even though the people and the three different Jared stores that I've been to have been very professional and very nice because of your business practices you guys suck.

In mid December, the store manager, Adrienne, realized that the ring had mistakenly been shipped to Oklahoma. I understand there are a lot of shipping issues at the moment so I completely understood. On December  23rd, I called and was told by the store manager that the best direction to go would be to do a completely new order and that is would be scheduled to arrive in mid January. For a wedding on February 6th, a mid January shipment was cutting it too close for comfort considering our experience to this point.

My wife and I both ordered our wedding bands from Marquirettes during one of their crazy sales and were really happy about the price. It was certainly too good to be true because while my ring came in after a few weeks as advertised, my wife's band took much longer than they said it would. We timed it out where I would be able to pick up her ring before I left school after graduation and that time passed. We figured it would only be a bit behind schedule, but after 4-5 months of waiting (on a 6-8 week purchase) we had to buy a new band from somewhere else. We didn't receive a single call or email from them regarding the delayed shipment and we had to call every couple of weeks to hear that it was on its way. They had apparently ordered it from overseas and instead of getting us a new ring when ours didn't show up they just sat around and waited for it. it got to be a month before our wedding and we knew we couldn't wait any longer so we had to call them up and demand a refund (because they didn't offer us one even after all that time). This was by far the worst customer service I have ever dealt with and will not ever recommend this company to anyone.

My husband has bought several pieces of jewelry for me at Marquirette's over the past few years.  I've gotten to feel comfortable with them. Since our 10th anniversary was approaching, I asked Benjy to help with the redesign.  He asked me to give him an idea of the style I like. I printed out a few images online and we looked through the cases for similar styles. The diamonds from my original bridal set were princess cut, and I wanted them to be the focal point in the new ring. I found a setting in the store that I really liked, but it didn't accommodate my diamonds. Benjy went to work measuring and configuring a new setting based on all these different components. A few days later he showed me a digital image of the proposed new ring. We talked about it, tweaked a few items, took more measurements, and he had an updated image of the design a few days later.  I was very happy with what he'd come up with, so we moved forward with having the mounting casted. A couple weeks later they took my diamonds to be placed in the new setting. My husband and I picked up the new ring this past week. I'm blown away!  It's breathtaking!  Far better than I imagined. We cannot thank Benjy, Abby, Lyle and all the sweet ladies who work at Marquirette's enough. I would never have taken the leap without their guidance and expertise.

We had an engagement ring custom-made and it took us almost SIX months to finally get the ring back.  We never got exactly what had been promised, but finally got close enough and gave up.   During the stressful course of events, many things happened that were unprofessional and just poor business. Some of the lowlights include:\n\n-the staff repeatedly forgot that we were using our own gems (the whole reason we had a ring custom made)\n\n-staff seemingly just forgot about us multiple times.  they were supposed to send a design and a week, two weeks, three weeks would go by and then i would call to check and they would make up an excuse about their e-mail system crashing or their daughter had accidentally deleted their e-mails.\n\n-Had the ring made a completely wrong size (even after telling them repeatedly in person and through e-mail the correct size)\n\n-After ring had been made the completely wrong size, we were told they would fix it as soon as possible.  I received a phone call two days later saying that everything was taken care of and the ring had been resized.  We came into town the following day to pick up the ring and it had not been touched.  It was still the same wrong size it had originally been made.  Then the jeweler who would have to resize was out of town on vacation for a week.\n\n-When it finally was resized, the bands did not fit snugly against the engagement ring like they had before, and the staff was condescending to my finance and tried to make her think it had always fit that way.\n\n-The staff lost our extra diamonds and gold from the ring then tried to act like we had traded those in, even though that had never been discussed.\n\nThe store looks fancy and the staff looks professional, but it is all a facade.  If you just need to walk in and buy a ring, they could probably get that right, but I would NOT trust them with any custom work and will not be using them again for any of our jewelry needs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b79f4c74e39:0x817d54d1b05f7541"}

Whenever a jeweler sizes a ring, they then have to follow up on their work by checking each individual stone and tightening it, which can become very labor intensive when you are dealing with rings that have a large number of tightly spaced stones down the shoulder and onto the shank.  When it's all said and done, our objective is to make sure that when you get your ring back, you can wear it with full confidence that everything will remain where it belongs, from the ring on your finger down to the smallest stone on the shank.\n\nAgain, thank you so much, and I hope that helps clarify our policies a bit for you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888dd4d29378307f:0x3fa4cd5e97e0d99d"}

They were doing research too.\nDeeDee has me considering a Rolex for myself (though I do love my Breitling!) and I will definitely want to work with her again.\nUpon leaving, my son told me that Thelma wouldn\u2019t even discuss the Deep Sea with them. She simply replied, \u2018There\u2019s a waiting list for those.\u2019 He was very glad that he returned this evening and I\u2019m so glad that he met me at the store and had a great experience instead of dismissing them all together.

They lost my grandmothers pearl necklace clasp in the restringing of the pearls. It was the only piece of jewelry she ever gave me upon my high school graduation. They were brought back from the war by my grandfather. The clasp is what dated the pearls and proved their history.  They also cut my best friends diamond setting to force a diamond that didn\u2019t fit into the ring and it fell out. The list goes on and on. Plus their prices are ridiculous. Go to Solomon brothers in Atlanta before you trust these people with anything!!!!!!!! Also, If you get your pearls restrung there, they take them out of the store and they go to \u201cJo\u2019s home, \u201c which is just totally unprofessional on every level.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ced3b31867db9:0x5b6d30d564256494"}

Jessica, the store Manager, was INCREDIBLE.  I had dreaded walking in and she immediately made us feel at home. The reason I am leaving a review is because not only was the man claiming a dispute with his credit company in there and behaving like an absolute juvenile, I fully believe the call she received from who I gathered (from eavesdropping tbh) was corporate was in regards to the man on here complaining about \"an order.\" First of all, I am a retail manager as well. If I gave a return on a machine we sent somewhere for maintenance I would lose my job.  The man acted like a baby, and my husband was irate that a grown man should behave that way. The manager, though, was nothing less than professional,  and dealt with it better than I would have for sure! Secondly,  when I listened to her phone conversation about pendant man,  Jessica said more than once but shouldn't we do something for him, they hadn't found out if they could yet (or something like that.) All I thought that day was wow, people are so rude, and it's not even their fault. I never thought I would recommend the Decatur store, but 100% I recommend to everyone! The staff is nice, I actually trust them for once, and the manager Jessica is clearly willing to go above and beyond to try to help you even when you act like a total jerk to her. I admit even I kinda did at first, I just expected the kind of service that caused us to stop going there.

I took my engagement ring in for its 6 month checkup and to go down a quarter of a size. They told me to come back in two weeks and it will be here. So two weeks later we go in to get it and it\u2019s been ruined when they went to go down a half a size. Had a huge gash in it, popped out two big diamonds and a diamond on the side. We were heartbroken, they also told us that it was a discontinued ring so they couldn\u2019t reorder another ring and to pick another ring. So I spent a couple days looking and just couldn\u2019t find any ring that I liked. So I ended up going to the Kay\u2019s in bridgestreet and instantly falling in love with one. Told them the situation and they were so shocked. They said they had never had a ring be sent off and be ruined at their store. They told me to tell Decatur which one I wanted and they could have it ordered. So my fianc\u00e9 called Decatur asking if they could have it in my size and ordered and the girl said absolutely you can, come tomorrow and we will have it all ready for you. Well we go the next day and the girls calling all these places just to come back to me to say we can\u2019t get your ring in a size for you so pick another ring. I was so upset. They ruined my ring, then told me the night before they could just to have me go all the way to the store to tell me no they can\u2019t pick another one. I was so angry I ended up leaving. I later in the week went back to the bridestreet and they were so shocked with Decatur\u2019s performance to us, they said we can absolutely get you the ring you want in the size you need and they were confused why Decatur told us we couldn\u2019t. They told us to go into Decatur, get our ring and walk out and call customer service. So we did and the store manager himself fixed us up at bridgestreet with the ring we wanted, plus the band, the size we wanted, and ensured us it would be in two weeks in time for engagement pictures. Yesterday my ring came in, it\u2019s absolutely perfect!! It just goes to show Decatur is very unprofessional, their workers are unskilled and the store manager not once came to handle the situation or talked to us about it even when we were two feet away from her.

April and Christie went above and beyond with their customer service to help me with my issue and ensure all my needs were met. I had to get my wedding ring cleaned and repaired as a diamond had fell out. I sent the pieces of jewelry off mid-March and was expecting them back around early-April. My jewelry ticket consisted of one diamond in my band to be replaced, the three separate pieces sautered together, and the final ring cleaned. Upon mid-April, I did not hear from the store on the status of my ring so my husband and I went to the store in person to get an update. Ms. April informed me that the ring was being held because they wanted to make sure that I was okay with how the ring would potentially come out and discuss any pitfalls. I was informed there would be a potential gap in the ring once the pieces were sautered together. Upon me giving the okay, the ring was supposedly sent to be fixed and I continued to wait patiently. During that time, Ms. April helped me find two other LeVian rings that were on sale and that were absolutely gorgeous and suitable to wear at my job. I decided that once my other rings came back, I would get the two new rings resized for my finger. Coming into the first week of May, I discovered my ring was still not back and at this point I was getting very flustered. Ms. Christie spoke with me and ensured that she would get my ring repaired and back to me quickly and had apologized for the long wait. She personally made sure to let the jeweler know to expedite the process. When my ring finally did arrive back, the middle stone of the main ring was still cloudy, there was black residue on the ring bands, the ring was resized even smaller than my finger, and the same diamond was missing when it was presented to me. At this point I was livid, upset, and refused to do any more business with Kay Jewelers. Despite my ordeal, Ms. April and Ms. Christie showed me the greatest empathy for my situation. I was given a comforting and sorrowful hug from Ms. April. Ms. Christie personally took my ring to the jeweler and stayed with it until it was complete so that I would have the ring that same day and not have to wait any longer then I already had. In addition, she ensured that the other two rings that I recently purchased was resized that say day and back on my hand. These ladies truly exemplify the highest standard for customer service. My frustration and anger was not toward these two ladies but toward the poor service I received from the people repairing my ring. Now I do not take my ring off. Each ring or necklace I get from Kay\u2019s is not just a piece of jewelry, but it is a story of my life.

I showed up today to pick up my rings, and a very rude pretentious older sales man informed me that neither of my rings were ready to pick up and that I would have to come back another time.

About a month after receiving the ring, it became apparent to me that the main stone was loose (it was not only wiggly and I could feel it, but it was actually rattling audibly). From being loose there was dust/dirt trapped between the stone and the basket of the stone. Keep in mind I had not been wearing it daily so it was surprising it came loose after such a short period of time.\n\nI brought the ring to the foley Zales to have the sterling silver prongs tightened and the basket cleaned. The rep there said since it wasn\u2019t purchased with warranty I had to pay out of pocket for both the cleaning and repair. It would cost $90.00. (Almost as much as the gift itself, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about the fact it hadnt been purchased without a warranty and I wasn\u2019t going to call up the person who gave it to because that would be rude).\n\nWhen I picked up the ring I was ready to pay for services done, except the moment my hands touched it I knew it was still loose. I showed the representatives behind the counter and they swore up and down to me that it wasn\u2019t loose and it was my imagination. They wiggled it and one even got her pen ink on it trying to \u201cdisprove\u201d me.\n\nThey said they could send it back free of charge so I said ok. But I got a bad feeling and since it had become a sentimental gift I felt like I no longer trusted that store to handle it since I felt like they were lying to me about it not being loose. I asked them for it back and they said yes but they would have to charge me the $90.00. I didn\u2019t want to have a confrontation with them so I paid and figured maybe I should just get a second opinion because it very well could be my imagination.\n\nShe swipes my card and is packing it up and I said \u201cI hear it rattling, tell me you can\u2019t hear that! Call me crazy, It can\u2019t be my imagination!\u201d\n\nShe held it up to her ear and to my surprise said \u201cyes! I do hear it rattling. You\u2019re not crazy\u201d.\n\nIm dumbfounded!! Before I paid, she said it wasn\u2019t loose, lied to my face, then the moment I swiped my card, she acknowledged it was loose!!! I am appalled. I\u2019m just going to dispute the transaction with my bank now because there is no way I trust the people working there. And I\u2019m going to advise the person who purchased it for me to do the same. I won\u2019t be making any purchases from jewelry stores like this again. I learned the hard way, at least this time it was only $90 instead of $900", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e3378b63149:0x38a08331cfe85986"}

Went to Kays about a week & a half ago to look and purchase an engagement ring with my fiance. Starting looking at rings in our budget and was only shown 1 ring which I loved (& the girl who showed us the ring got kinda in trouble for showing it to us) until they said they were having a diamond show & started showing me rings from those cases, apparently they only have a diamond show every so often and I was shown about 3 rings or so from those cases & ended up picking one of the 3 after being felt like those were the only ones in our budget and  I was pressured into it. We were able to get the ring sized that day & take it home.\n\nSkip to week or so later, I decided to just browse online at rings that were in our budget & that said available in store at my local store. Came across several beautiful rings that I was NEVER shown to begin with so I decided to call and speak with the manager who helped us & told her about how I had seen a few online that said they were available in store & in our budget, so I go to the store to see them in person to make sure I didn't pick the wrong ring.\nGot there & the manager who from the first visit was super helpful and nice, didn't speak to me once when I entered the store. I showed the girl who was helping me a few rings I seen online that said they were in store & the first ring she said \" oh we just sold that ring\" the 2nd and 3rd ring I showed her she Said \" I don't think we have it\" & I was like \"why would it say it was in store if It wasnt?\" She couldn't give me an answer. She did everything in her power to convince me to keep the ring I had but that pissed me off even more so I still ended up returning the ring which I know they aren't happy about, but I wasn't happy with being pretty much only shown options that benefited them. They didn't treat me the same as the first experience & u just don't do your customers that way. Regardless. I will do everything to make sure everyone is aware of how crooked this place is.\n\nAlso, after returning the ring (which was leased throigh progressive) we made an account online to see how the process of the refund was going, come to find out our total was double the price we were told it would be in store from the kay employees. The deposit we put down was suppose to be 79 dollars and would also be the amount of our monthy payment & after looking online we discovered they charged us 86 dollars for the deposit & that our payments would be 91.60 WEEKLY! We were told 79 dollars and some change monthly and then it shot up to 91.60 weekly! They never went over the contract or interest rate with us.\n\nAfter the return I asked the employee if everything on their end was done and all we were waiting on was the leasing company to do their part. Called the leasing company to find out that they were waiting on KAYS to send the invoice over to get the refund process done & taken care of.\n\nCalled Kays once again to speak with the unprofessional, rude heifer off a \"Manager\" to make sure they sent the invoice in and to try to get some answers as to why she never vocally disclosed with us while signing the lease that our total was actually double the price she told us, & she would not answer the question. All she would say was \"you made the return, what else do you need, blah blah..\" How they can get away with is beyond me, after asking her multiple times times she actually HUNG UP on us. I called bk & another girl asnwer the phone, I continued to try to get answers we as customers deserved & as I was speaking the girl started pressing buttons on the phone & then hung up on me, incredibly immature & unprofessional. I am mind blown at my experience. I made a complaint with corporate, with the better business Bureau and got intouch with the district manager with the help of another kays manager of a different location!\nKAYS IS A FREAKING JOKE, THEY LIE & NEVER FULLY DISCLOSE THE FULL TRUTH & PRICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR SALES & COMMISSION!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a68210bdbea6d:0xd5e4dcdfa346b928"}

The owner changed my battery and then admitted to me that he had broken the watch crystal (clear glass over watch face). He reassured me that he would fix my watch. He is a liar, thief and con-artist. In the almost two months that they were \u201cfixing\u201d my watch I went 3 times to try to get any information. Finally I just gave up and told them to give me my watch broken. The owner was rude, impolite and intimidating.\nWhenever; I informed him that I wanted my watch immediately regardless of the fact that 2 months later it was STILL BROKEN. He said that he had tried to \u201cmake it right\u201d and that he had been looking to buy me another watch from EBAY. The watch I have is a limited edition Android Prism watch that is no longer being made. He said that he had been unable to find any watch similar to mine. While I do not watch a watch from EBAY; I would like to point out that in the last 4 minutes I have found over 5 watches currently for sale on EBAY with the exact same crystal. These are not cheap Wal-Mart watches; he simply did not even try to find a similar watch.\nThe owner stated that since he had been unable to find a similar watch on ebay (lie) that he would have to send the watch out to Las Vegas to have a crystal custom made. If that was the case then why after 2 months was my watch still sitting on the counter? Why had they not already sent it to be fixed?  It does not take 2 months to drive to the post office. It is apparent that they had no plans on trying to fix my watch.\nWhen the watch was originally broken by the owner, it had a tiny chip in the upper right corner. The watch has received even more damage since it has been in their possession. The original chip has spread to 3 times the size along with a new crack on the upper left. The back is covered in DOZENS of scratches and the hands do not seem to be functioning correctly.\nThe owner did not even try to fix my watch. He did not even offer a replacement. Under no circumstances should anyone ever go to these people. Now all I have is a broken piece of crap, and no way to have it fixed or repaired. They broke my watch and refused to fix it.

My husband I went to the Galleria location to get my size and we wanted to look at the one I had found. Unfortunately it was an \u201conline only\u201d item. The woman who got my size acted as if she was not only inconvenienced by us but as if she was better than us. So my husband ended up ordering the ring and gave it to me on Christmas Eve. When I took it out of the box and put it on I noticed one of the diamonds were missing. My husband immediately called their 1-800 customer service number and they directed us to take the ring to the nearest Zales and they would decide wether to have the ring repaired or replaced. Being Christmas Eve night the location was closed and closed the next day for Christmas. We went to the Galleria location on December 26th and when we explained the situation to an employee they went and got the manager. The manager then asked what we wanted done. I told them I wanted it fixed. Then they asked if I had the paper work for the diamond bond that came with it. I told them no that it should be fixed period considering it was a brand new ring. After about 30 minutes of talking to the manager she said she would take care of it and we wouldn\u2019t have to use the diamond bond and we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything. I even went ahead and bought the extended warranty on the metal and the sapphire. The manager said it should be ready by January 7th. When that day got here my husband called and it was not ready yet. Well my husband got a call yesterday, January 10th, that the ring was ready and that it was going to cost $110. When we got there to pick up the ring the woman that was working was the rude woman that waited on us before and the one that rang up my extended warranty. She told us it was going to be the $110. I told her we weren\u2019t paying a dime that the manager was supposed to be taking care of it. Apparently the manager was not there and had made no notes of anything!! I got extremely frustrated and upset. Eventually, after getting verbal and irrate, another employee came over and tried to calm me down. The woman ended up giving us the ring and not charging us. None of this should have ever happened. I will never buy another thing from Zales again!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889221402e1fc1d:0xdf5089bd7c120266"}

I bought my ring last Tuesday. They hurried it's sizing for me so it would be ready. That's ONE star. They told me it would be ready at 2pm. Wasn't. Then I was told 3pm. Wasn't. Then I was told 4pm. Wasn't. Then, at 5pm, I was told she left to pick up my ring, would be back in 15 minutes and I could go ahead and head up there. 30 minutes later I'm there. My ring isn't. An hour and 15 minutes later and she's not back with my ring. An hour and a half later, she's there with my ring. Isn't nice. Isn't happy. Isn't smiling. This is the MANAGER. She hands me my rings, doesn't ask if they fit ok, doesn't ask if I like them, doesn't ask if that would complete my purchase or if I need anything. Throws it in a box, hands it to me without saying a word and walks away! They talked bad about me because I'm already under the pressure of my wedding, getting my rings on time and I'm mad because they've told me lies all day long! Of course I'm going to be upset! I was lied to several times! What sucks for them?? I was preparing to buy a bracelet and a pair of earrings but instead, I walked out. When we got home we closed our credit account with them. TWO stars because my rings are absolutely beautiful. But, I will never go there again! She was sooo nice when she was selling me the rings but after she got her commission, she no longer cared if she upset me or not. She's the manager, yet her and her two employees sat there and talked about me while all three staring at me! So, two stars. For my beautiful rings and them helping me get my rings on time. What really sucks is I already left her a great review from when she wanted my money and sold me the rings. I'd love to speak to someone higher up, but they all seem to believe their employees, even if there are cameras. BTW, when I left, I went to Kay's and bought my earrings and bracelets from them!

This Zales location is where my husband, the man in uniform in the picture below, bought my wedding ring (#19868058) on October 2017. When first purchased from Zales, the ring had a morganite stone, which was beautiful, but I had my heart set on aquamarine. We also purchased the lifetime warranty on the ring, and later another warranty just on the aquamarine stone I picked out. To make a long story short (for character count) during our time at Zales we were lied to, given false information, struggled getting in touch with the store as well as returned calls, and were pressured to purchase an aquamarine stone at a price much higher than previously discussed. Overall, my husband and I were very displeased with the service we received at Zales. Anyway, after a painstaking process, I finally got my ring back around December-January with the new aquamarine stone. Being fed up with Zales, my husband and I decided to go to Kay to have our wedding bands made. We went the same day I got my ring back from Zales to begin the process of ordering our wedding bands through Kay. His wedding band was relatively simple and took only about a month or 2 until we were able to pick it up, however, mine had to be custom made to fit the oval of my wedding ring. I picked the french beaded design Kay had for my wedding band to be made and they put all the information into the computer system. Kay assured us the bands would be ready in time for our wedding and that they would give us a call when I was able to pick my engagement ring up and to review and approve a molding of my wedding band. About 2 months went by and we hadn't heard anything, but I needed my ring for our engagement party. I had it for about a week and was told Kay needed it back to make the wedding band. Finally at about April or May we received the call that I was able to pick up my engagement ring, but never had a molding to look at and approve. In late May, about 2 weeks before we were getting married, Kay called and said my wedding band was ready. Upon seeing my wedding band that we had waited 4-5 months for the first time, I burst out crying uncontrollably and couldn't even speak to the lady. They had made the band in the wrong design. I was told that I either had to use that band to be married with and then we could start the process all over again after our honeymoon or that I wouldn't have anything to be married with. After several discussions with corporate, we were able to get our money back in full for my wedding band. I felt so defeated... I only had my engagement ring about 2 months out of our 9 month engagement period and I had no wedding band to be married with. Luckily, we found a local, family owned store that was able to make my wedding band in 2 weeks. Lou's in fact overdid themselves and made my wedding band OVERNIGHT! I saw the molding one day and was able to pick up my wedding set the next day! They saved us. But back to my aquamarine wedding ring. On the 5th day of our cruise I lost my stone. As you can see in the pictures below, the prong completely broke off and the stone fell out. I searched the ship for 4 hours, sobbing the entire time and finally a little girl found the stone at the bottom of the pool! We took the ring back to Zales as soon as we got back to port and they soldered a new prong on in about 2 weeks or so. Not even a month later when we were in Savannah for my birthday, I was taking my wedding set off to clean it and the band completely snapped in half (picture bellow). I took my ring to a local Zales a few days later, but not until another area on the band broke, leaving my ring in 2 pieces. Since we had the complete warranty on the ring and stone and this was the second time the ring had broken I told Zales that I wanted my aquamarine stone put into a new setting. Well now I have my ring back. No new setting, just soldered in 3 separate places. Now I'm scared just to put the ring on my finger. Why are we treated like this when we've paid so much money?", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_G9nZMWGEKaykUu4_hJqkMuPOTGvyA-tVHezQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkZzymrZ58H7rgSUcx4aAYMPcnQuSVKUFkoJZt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhIvb-S9YhwDKqyDwFWD3rOrPGXQ9TQd-v51p7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da185689b79:0x50916a0e1ccfac2a"}

I went in for a new battery for my husband's Movado watch. I inquired about a piece being welded back on a gold hoop earring that I had brought in on a Saturday back before the pandemic. The owner was not there but a young man was with an unkempt appearance. He quoted me $45. I told him that was more than I paid for them so I guess I would just sell them for scrap. So currently while in the jewelry shop, I inquired with the owner who informed me they have a $30/minimum. I was not told of that the 1st time I inquired. The owner began chatting saying, \"You know, I went to the dealership the other day, they told me my tire was going to be $150, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" Then he said, \"I went to the grocery store, they said my groceries were $100, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" While putting the battery in the watch, he stated, \"You know this watch has the wrong size battery?\" \"The battery is too big.\" I informed him it was purchased at a pawn shop so I have no clue who put the battery in but it worked for a long time. He said, \"Well, that's what you get buying from a pawn shop,\" in a condescending tone. I never requested a lower price on the earring repair. I will not pay for something only to be spoken to in this manner. His level of sarcasm was ridiculous.

Sorry you had a bad experience this time around. Hope the battery that we put into your watch stays working longer than the one you got from the pawn shop. As for your earring. You came in the store without it and you did want a price on how much it would cost to fix it. But we can not give a price on any item unless we actually see it. You said you talked with me before the pandemic and I told you it would cost 45 dollars apparently. And like you said in your comment \"that was more than I paid for them\".\nWe don't do any repairs on earrings for free and we do have a minimum price we charge on basic repairs like those. I know you wanted a cheaper price because you complained to the owner about it. That is why he gave you examples of other scenarios like the ones you posted in your comment. Hes by no means trying to upset you or offend you in anyway. He just wanted you to understand that we don't barter with prices and we can't just give you a price without seeing the item. The owner also is very honest and upfront with any problems with repairs. That is also why he was concerned and wanted to let you know your watch already had the wrong battery put in it. As for me, I am the young man replying to your review and I do reply to all reviews that concern me. I do believe calling me unkempt was rude and uncalled for especially since I never said anything bad at all to you and barely talked with you in our store.

It's a family owned store and the staff has always been very courteous to me and given great advice. The older man is very blunt/honest about things so I can see how people would take offense but he's only ever been helpful to me. They replaced my watch battery which wasn't a normal sized battery, sized and polished my ring, and welded my broken necklace. They suggested I buy a new chain since it was just a simple Walmart one and more likely to break again. They also advised me not to wear it to sleep or in the shower like I have been. I've never had a decent chain for my necklace and the pendant was a gift from my significant other so I broke down and bought a box chain. I don't regret it at all. This new chain has lasted me over 6 months. As far as the work I've had done, it was all done within a few minutes (battery) to hours (ring size). The prices are reasonable for the work you get done. I'll add pictures later if I get the chance", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2652292ca55:0x21841c55b0c7bb0d"}

He \"placed\" my diamond in but said, it was just sitting in there and if I was to wear it, it would come out.  I FINALLY get my $150 together and go in last week, only to be told, the prongs around my center diamond needed to be replaced and that was $300 off the top....I was BLOWN away, to say the least.  He goes on to say, each side had to be completely re-done and THAT would be $150/side, totaling $300!!  I advised him he NEVER said that and he responded, with a smile, \"Well, you can look at it and tell it needs new prongs on the top\".  I said, well, I can't, I'm not a jeweler, with a smile!  I advised him I wasn't prepared to pay $600 for a job that was quoted $150. He just responded, well, that's what it gonna take to have it right...oh, the diamond is loose, I can't tell\"!  He gave me a card(which I tore up and trashed) with his \"new\" quote!  Can you say SCAM ARTIST!!  I'm making sure I tell EVERYONE, not to patron him.

The ring was almost as if someone took a paint brush and painted it barely with rose gold on the sides. However a little bit of the rose gold plating did come off while cleaning it. We were sorry about that and we did tell her if she did get another ring we would size it for free. And she did come back into the store today with you and I actually handled the conversation, and I by no means was rude so I'm sorry if you felt that I or the owner was rude in anyway. And I'm not shocked at all that you came back because we wanted to make things right. As far as getting your ring done and calling you. Christmas is a very busy time and we can't promise to get your repair done right away. And can't promise to call you when it is done. Thats why we tell customers it may take just an hour or two or longer and to just check back in with us. But we did want to ensure we got your repair done and you and your wife were happy with it before the day ended. And thats all that matters in the end.
