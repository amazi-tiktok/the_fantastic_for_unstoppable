I am absolutely appalled at the staffing of this establishment. My son and his friend (both 10) were physically assaulted by a group of teenagers (15). Now I know, kids can be wild but I had several adults that I didnt know run to find me when this happened. My older nephew attempted to intervene as these children were stomping on my sons stomach and forcibly holding him under the ball pit. I was informed by multiple adult witnesses who confirmed this was in fact what was happening. When my nephew tried to tell the boys to leave my 10 year old son alone the boys ADULT father bowed up on my nephew making threats yelling in his face. My nephew is also A CHILD. There were ZERO staff members to be found and when I was finally able to talk to a manager (Tiffany) I was disrespected and cut off mid sentence. She refused to hear my concerns. I was completely rational and calm as I was just trying to speak with someone in charge and have the cameras viewed so I could find out what actions should be taken. When asked to speak to someone above her she refused to give me any name or contact info and WALKED AWAY mid sentence. We have always enjoyed bringing our children here, but if I am paying for a party that large with that many children I would expect my guests to be SAFE. I would love to speak with someone above the managers on staff due to the absolute lack of professionalism they displayed. It is not my intention to be tacky or tasteless but I am shocked at how children being visibly injured was met by \"management\". This establishment should be well staffed for the level of children it sees on a nightly basis and all of the children should feel and BE safe. Staff members do not supervise in any way, like other trampoline parks do. spending close to 500$ for a 2 hour party, my child and his friend were jumped on kicked and bullied by 5 teenage boys and the manager (Tiffany) didn't even offer an apology or ask the children if they were okay.. nothing. My experience was awful. Tiffany would not hear my concerns, would not review the cameras and let me know the severity of the situation. Due to this, 5 kids left my sons party and I was left feeling a HUGE lack of customer service. The chosen manager of this establishment should put children first, listen to the concerns of paying patrons and have solutions. She was the most disrespectful manager I have ever met. I had my  son and his friend upset right in front of her and she barely looked at them, didn't ask if they were okay. She walked away.\n\nafter reaching out to an owner, I was not offered any resolution or an offer of looking at the camera. Simply \"I'll speak to tiffany about this\" and s\"orry this happened\". finally got the apology that should have happened days before but too little too late. what resolution would you expect if this happened at a party you were hosting and it was your children being hurt?\n\ngreat leadership comes from the top. get it together. while I know these specific incidents are isolated, you should know how to handle these situations and so should your staff. view  the cameras, even if the patron cannot. have a resolution.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890db69088959d:0x4332f45319ad0a5e"}

(Don't get carried away .. No matter how much you enjoy it... If you do more than 20minutes, your body is probably going to be sore the next day or two) for a little extra money there is also a rock climbing wall and a zip line that will send you across the building to one side and then whip you around back to where you started from instead of just going straight across so that was really cool. There's an area where you can be tethered above for safety but being able to walk across small platforms or climb across a web of rope... they're just a lot of things to do. I saw the children of all ages they're having a good time. ( my 15 yr old going through one of those phases where nothing entertains him...

Please do not enter the building while anyone is in the air!!!!!\n\nPLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RIDE ANY OF THE AIR ATTRACTIONS HERE WITHOUT BEING ADVISED THAT AN AIR ROPES COURSE RIDER WHO APPEARED TO BE STILL STRAPPED IN THE HARNESS FELL SEVERAL FEET JUST LAST FRIDAY 3/29/19, AND THE COMMUNITY IS NOT AWARE OF THIS.  Don't let it be your kid please!  PEOPLE SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND BELOW WERE ALSO HARMED!!!!\n\nThis is important!! I'll repeat it.  If you plan to go and play it safe by not riding in the air, then this review is still for you and all of your family  because PEOPLE SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND BELOW WERE ALSO HARMED!!!!\n\nPlease read on or call to try to find out for yourself before you go.  I don't want it to happen again to anyone!!  I've tried many times for a week now, but I can't reach any local or corporate officials with Urban Air to explain or calm our fears.  Who checks on these things?  Who answers to every parent that takes their kids to Urban Air?\nIt's Friday again and I'm trying not to scream at the thought that Urban Air Trampoline and Adventure Park in Trussville is still open (as far as I know) and still not answering any real questions about last Friday's horrific experience.   This wasn't your average bounce on the trampoline and break an ankle thing. This was a HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE that really happened to innocent people.   Urban Air, what's preventing it from happening again?\n\nHow do you drop a person from the sky?  Why did you drop her on top of a mom who was simply sitting on a bench below? It Was Horrible!!! There is so much more to say, but graphic details are not appropriate or important here.\n\nI don't know if the other visitors there on Friday are just still too shaken up to talk about it.  Or just so relieved like us that their kid didn't fall.  Or maybe like me they hate to write online reviews (especially bad ones).  Well I would give Urban Air Trampoline Adventure Park in Trussville, Alabama negative 5 stars if I could, but I can't, so 1 horrible star.  Our little one has had a difficult time since he saw that horrible event on his last outing for Spring Break.  Thank goodness, he made it out ok.  Still, I'm so very sorry we chose  the Trussville Urban Air, but we knew other kids who enjoyed it there in the past.  I'm sorry to say we even teased a teenager who was too scared to ride, but he was wiser than us I guess.  We researched. We read the google reviews first. Obviously, not enough people write reviews.  We thought it was safe (trampoline park safe anyway).  We were wrong!   It's not even safe to sit on the benches and watch your babies.  And the lack of customer followup and consideration just adds to the mess.\n\nBecause of the layout of this Urban Air in Trussville, people on the ground are always under one of the air rides!  There should be a safety net or some type of separate area to keep kids above and kids and families below safe!!!!!!  We've visited Homewood Urban Air without a big problem. (Of course they don't have the air rope course and racer).\n\nPLEASE DON'T LET ANYONE YOU LOVE (OR HATE) SIT OR WALK AROUND ANYWHERE IN THIS URBAN AIR LOCATION WHEN SOMEONE IS RIDING ANY AIR ATTRACTION (even with a harness)!!!\n\nI hope this helps someone.  If you saw this, please speak up too and let people know.  It's time.  I can't believe the news didn't cover this.  I wish someone else said it sooner than me.  Every customer who was there Friday deserves answers, although not nearly as much as the injured victims.  We hope and pray they are alive and OK.  Every potential customer deserves answers so that it doesn't happen again.\n\nUrban Air in Trussville, I don't see how you are still open and promoting Birthday packages. But since you are, PLEASE PROTECT YOUR PATRONS( that includes kids riding and also includes moms and babies sitting and watching below)!!   I hope you are at least answering and helping the people you seriously hurt last Friday.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554563277949, "text": "Hi Kim,\r\rThis is Carolyn from the Corporate office.
