This information was also not told up front, but after signing up in the paperwork required.  Extra money for field trips, snacks, pizza parties, gas for the vans?!, etc.  Honestly, this is what changed our mind from doing the After School Program.  Also keep in mind the After School Program change: initially they said there would be homework time, Jiu Jitsu/tumbling/gymnastics practice, and an active game (we thought, perfect, not on devices!).

I was only there for 3 weeks so the 1 month no contract plan was great. My friend also was with me for just 3 days and it was $5 for a drop in visit so extremely affordable. The gym is family owned so the it\u2019s not 24 hours, but the time worked fine for me on vacation. Closed on Sundays. The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly and we had a wonderful experience. The equipment is a little bit old, but it was much larger and more extensive than I thought it was based on pictures and other reviews. They have plenty of equipment, the free weight area was great, and a great open spot for HIIT and cardio training. My one critique would be the age of some of the equipment and lack of water fountain (they sell water for $1 per bottle though) but being a smaller family owned business, I understand equipment can get pricey, especially during Covid. Great experience though and will be back anytime I visit Birmingham.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891055c7b71b03:0x6f55f8ebb0d9b2c6"}

It is actually kind of sad, because my fianc\u00e9 and I really did love the work out, the classes, and the coaches! The experience overall was ruined by the front desk administration staff! my fianc\u00e9 and I joined this as a part of getting in shape before our wedding next year! When we signed up we made very clear what the fees were and etc.\n\nWe had some complications with changing our cards over! For example, at first my card was on the account and then we changed it over to my fianc\u00e9\u2018s card! (We had to fix this 5 times because the front desk staff could never get it right!) There were multiple times where we were having problems booking classes because the people that had taken our card information and supposedly switched it did not save/submit it to their system!\n\nLater to find out, they were charging us random charges! These random charges were repeat charges of our memberships repeat charges of 12 and $15. It got to be so bad they were charging us all throughout the months that our bank called us and told us that it was suspicious activity and that they were going to ban orange theory from charging us. we then tried to get in contact with the owner to give them a chance to make it right because we loved it so much! And she was very rude and did not do anything in her power to make it right. When we asked her what the charges were for she couldn\u2019t tell us the exact things that the random charges were for, which was SKETCHY!\n\nIn addition to this, it is very hard to book classes! We were always on a waiting list! And it we didn\u2019t feel like we were getting our money worth! I got so bad that we would try to book classes while we were there in person and sometimes the front desk staff would say that we\u2019re booked for weeks ahead of time and we weren\u2019t!\n\nOrange theory is a great work out overall and we saw great results! But this location is not professional, does not care about you or your finances, and they are extremely rude when they mess up and you confront them.

If you sign up for a class but have to miss for any reason (in my case it was always a sick child issue or schedule change), they charge you $10, so it's best to not sign up for classes in advance and just pop in. Also, if you want to cancel your contract, you have to show up in person and tell them that you would like to cancel. Then they have to send an email to their manager letting her know that you would like to cancel. Their manager will then ask for you to come back in and fill out the required paperwork. Therefore, to cancel, you have to make two trips back to the location. Rather than making this a smooth and easy process, they are determined to get you back in once more. Also, the manager has yet to respond to emails questioning this practice.

I did a few \"sessions\" with trainer Kyle and he definitely knows how to give you a good work out, you won't be disappointed. The two of us have a pretty regular thing going on now. The location is convenient just far from downtown if you're coming that way, and it can get pretty busy after work. I would suggest if you can try and go later in the evening to avoid the crowds and get an appointment with Kyle then hit the sauna afterwards for some small talk and hot relaxation. Also the steam room is great for extra privacy. There's no juice bar or anything like that but Pub 261 is just a minute up 31 and a great spot to loosen up a little bit instead of just going home and straight to bed. Kyle is also very skilled in deep tissue massage due to his strong grip and thick forearms, so if you are sore afterwards it's a good way jumpstart the recovery process and get you in the right mood if you know what I mean. I try to sleep 8-10hrs whenever I can but Kyle has so much stamina he keeps me going all night! It makes me feel like we're in college again. There's also a lap pool and racquetball court.

I spoke with someone to make the appt. for the class but never got a confirmation email, follow-up call, etc. after the initial conversation and providing my CC info. I was told to arrive at 4:45. I arrived at 4:53. Now I understand that I was a bit late, I get that. However, the class did not start until 5:15 so you would think a place looking to make an impression and gain 2 new clients would at least try to make it work or offer an additional time or option for another class.  However, Alyse immediately let us know we were too late. I said ok and started walking away. My brother asked if there was anything we could do (i.e. giving her a chance to offer another option for a class or try to work with us in some way) Her reply was, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, class is starting really soon. There\u2019s no way we can do everything we need you to do\u201d So, we said ok and left. I called back to get the young lady\u2019s name because I was so dissatisfied with my experience. I was baffled that I was flat out turned away without her taking any opportunity to reconcile the situation. When I spoke with her she mentioned my brother told her I wasn\u2019t a resident earlier as to allude to the fact that perhaps maybe this was the reason she was less concerned with retaining us a potential client. To the contrary, I grew up in Tuscaloosa, have been living in Atlanta for the past 9 years and made the decision just this past week to pack up my life and move back because my mom is battling Pancreatic Cancer for the 3rd time in 4 years and not doing well at all. I probably would have signed up on the spot today because for the last year I\u2019ve been a member at F45 in Atlanta and am very serious about transitioning to a gym based in Tuscaloosa that also has locations in Atlanta. This would be so I can workout when I commute back to Atlanta 2-3 days a week as I still hold my corporate job there but will work remotely here in Tuscaloosa for the most part. To say that I am extremely disappointed with the service is an understatement. I was truly hoping to have a great class, lock down a contract with a new gym that would fit my needs during this difficult and transitional time in my life, & then try to enjoy what was left of my birthday. Sadly, this was not the case. Very poor experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8303485c039:0x950b72dc7f30e396"}

You will quickly NOT be a stranger! The members and coaches of Forge do not care if it is your first day ever in a gym, first time trying Crossfit,  if you are a scaled or  RX+ athlete, new mother getting back on your fitness journey, whether you're in your 20's or 50's, you will always get cheered on, coached, and pushed the same the same every single day in the best, positive way. With some of the best programming around, the coaches make it easy to be a better you.  They meet you where you are based off your bodies needs whether that's doing 1 rep or 15. Your gym friends quickly become your gym FAMILY that you stay after class with, and share laughs and good talks with. It becomes the best part of your everyday routine. Forge Fitness also features recovery shop options, sauna, childcare, cardio room, basketball court, soccer field, and track. There's a place for all members of your family here.

I travel to the Birmingham area for work once a month and was looking for a gym/box that has hours on Sunday.  I had heard some not-so-great things about a few boxes but I hadn't heard of Forge Fitness/ CF Shades.  Not only is CF Shades the only place with Sunday hours, but they were above and beyond wonderfully welcoming when I showed up unannounced during their open gym period.  Upon first glance, the gym was very clean, which is not very common among CrossFit and Crossfit-inspired facilities.  The owner, Rich, jumped up from a staff meeting and gave me a tour and after learning of my CF history, invited me to use any and all of their space as well as invited me back through my duration of stay while in town.  They have an awesome workout space out back with a platform, squat racks and a rig and the running course around the building is super safe.  I also met coaches Caleb, Josh and Rebecca who were all very accommodating and friendly.  When I returned for a class, Rebecca coached and I really appreciated her attentiveness.  I'm a CrossFit coach in Denver and because I move relatively well, I tend to get left alone - but I love being coached when I drop into new places and Rebecca was great.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND travelers and locals to visit.  If you're a member somewhere else in Hometown or Birmingham, switch now.

I was close, but even though I failed, I was offered to apply the money I put in towards a membership... The gym even has given me a rain check to apply it in March after I get my tax return, so it's more affordable for me. (so not really a loss when all is said and done!)\n\nThe people (coaches and members) I met have been nothing but encouraging. The workouts were well designed to keep you moving to accomplish in less than 30 minutes what many other classes, at other gyms I've attended, it has taken an hour to achieve (which is nice when you are low on time in your day!)\n\nI have a knee injury, and in previous gyms, my disability has made me feel inadequate or ashamed that I could not do what the rest of the class was doing. The coaches knew about my injury (and no matter what class I attended (morning or afternoon) with any coach, they were already well informed of my needs without the embarrassment of having to say as much at every new encounter. They were discreet and quick to tell me alternate exercises I could do, so I didn't feel as if I was the odd man out waiting to be assigned something different or taking away from the class by holding up the rest of the members, so that a coach could assist me.)\n\nMembers are at all different fitness levels, and the coaches are very attentive to every one's individual needs, and they are watching you and your progress making sure that you are on point doing the exercises CORRECTLY! (which as long as I've been working out, I hadn't realized how many simple movements I was doing incorrectly!)\n\nI could write a book on all the good experiences I have had just in my six weeks of attending, but I will wrap it up here with a final statement that I highly recommend this gym. It's changed my outlook about what I need for my own fitness journey, and I look forward to returning in March!

I'm not where I want to be physically but I am well on my way thanks to these fine people. They are not cheap - but the value and the knowledge you learn is worth it.  They are crazy hard workouts that are intense and sometimes you want to cry and curl into the fetal position - but everyone does the workouts together and finishes every time and it gets easier.....a little. They scale the workouts to prevent injuries - I was really worried about my knees and they work with you so you don't injure yourself. They know their stuff and want to see you make progress not hurt yourself.  They aren't snobby and neither are the people that workout here - just normal friendly people. They are passionate about fitness not just some other gym you pay your monthly dues and get nothing in return. I was 330 pounds 3 1/2 months ago. Ive lost 45 pounds and feel awesome!

Overall the program itself is really good, and the coaches were wonderful.  I did get excellent results during this time in weightloss, body fat percentage reduction and high lean muscle.

I was sold that the 98% of challengers meet their goal, the meal plans are customized and that if for some reason you don't meet your goal you could apply to future classes. What I found is that ITF monthly fees are extremely high even with the so called Challenger discount, There seem to be very few challengers that actually meet the goal and the customized meal plan is merely based on starting weight and goal of weight loss, body fat percentage or muscle gain. There is no consideration of gender or age, which can be a huge factor in weight loss. The only offer is to apply your hefty deposit towards a minimally discounted 12 month commitment, so I am parting ways with ITF. Due to the way I feel they misrepresented this program.  I will be seeking a membership elsewhere, and will never do business with them in the future.

I find it the most difficult, challenging, and fun workout I've done in my life.  I'm still on a learning curve, but I can say that I've also made progress!  Before I signed on, I was very worried about re-injuring my rotator cuff.  I let them know about my past injury, Zech and Jon showed me ways to modify my workouts.  As my shoulder got stronger, I've not needed some of the modifications and according to my chiropractor and orthopedic doctor,  my shoulder has fully healed.  I hate weights...really.  But I'm now swinging the 35 pound kettle ball.   The biggest weight I had lifted prior to Irontribe was a 15 pound dumb bell for bicep curls or deadlifts.  With these guys, I've done a 2 max rep 165 deadlift, and I'm learning to do beginner handstand pull ups!  The group environment is fun.  They keep me going.  We cheer each other on.  I find that when you do something difficult, share a difficult experience, like a WOD lol,  we feel connected to the each other and we want to see one another succeed.  We get excited when someone reaches a PR or finishes a tough workout. I'm a school teacher, so I was initially concerned with the cost.  I've found the monetary, time, and physical investment to be worth it. The coaches are the best, they make me smile because they challenge me, they challenge me to put on more weight or work with me on my nutrition and check up my attendance and progress.  Zechariah and Jon, Jen, Brandon, and Joe really care and they enjoy what they do.  They're not only about the paycheck, they're about making better athletes and building a community.  I don't always \"enjoy\" the workouts.  But I enjoy and love this community.  We build relationships and athletes here.

My daughter was the first of us to use Dr. Mann.  She came in for really bad neck pain and headaches.  Dr. Mann said it was related to what is now being called 'text neck.' In two weeks of treatment she was completely better! Not only that it's been months now and she feels great- and still playing on that phone! The second patient was my son.  We were told he needed tubes in his ears because he had chronic ear infections for months.  It broke my heart thinking about that so I was chatting with Dr. Mann on one of my daughters visits and he told Chiropractic can be successful in treating that without tubes. So we gave it a try (child adjustments are different and very gentle if you didn't know) and low and behold after months of ear infections they were COMPLETELY gone.  We were thrilled- not to mention we saved hundreds avoiding surgery.  The next patient was me!  I do pure Barre and I was having trouble with my low back and knee.  It turns out that I had mobility issues.  Couple weeks of work and my workout is now a breeze. And finally my husband.  He's had back issues before but not quite like this recent one.  He works at a computer all day.  This time the sciatica was going all the way to his foot.  He is currently finishing up his rehabilitation with Dr. Mann and is already pain free!  I am so glad we came here first! No pain, no drugs, we feel great, and at a fraction of the price of surgery.

It looks like it's been said her a 100 times but I wanted to say why my treatments here allow me to say how much I mean that and miss being in Alabama!  I spend most of the year in Atlanta now because of work.  I have tried and tried to find a chiropractor here that was as good as Dr. Mann but I haven't been successful.  I called Dr. Mann before one of my appointments in Atlanta and asked if he would mind talking to my chiropractor (bless him for doing that) Even after an in depth conversation about the type of treatments I was receiving with Dr. Mann in Decatur I still wasn't getting the same level of relief from my Atlanta chiropractor that I was receiving at Advanced Chiropractic.  My neck is just not the same when I go to other places.  I only get to be adjusted a few times a year by Dr. Mann now because of the move and it's one of the worst things about not being home.  But every time  I am in town seeing Dr. Mann is on the list!  Another thing I always appreciated about Dr. Mann's office is there is always a plan.  He doesn't just say 'see ya' at the end of your appointment.  If I am working on an injury I always know when I need to be seen again.  If I am on wellness I know I need to be back monthly.  Other places I have been don't give any direction and it just seems less professional.  Be thankful for what you have here!!! He's the best! Thanks again Dr. Mann!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1579812925781, "text": "Thank you so much Jennifer for leaving us a review!

I'm a fan of all things wellness and am a believer that the chiropractor can save you from surgery. I am also very picky about the places I go for treatment and advice. I had just relocated to the area for work.  My supervisor had also just moved here and said I should give this place a try.  I called ahead and asked about the services provided and some questions about my new insurance.  I had my appointment that evening.  The office is more modern looking than some of the other places in town (past experience has taught me sometimes old building means outdated doctor). The staff and doctors are all nice people and I can without a doubt say that was the best treatment I have ever been given.  My last chiropractor was a good friend and great person but was a smaller build. Just guessing but I think that really was the difference in treatments and let me tell you it was significant. I come in about once a month and it keeps me doing everything I like (and some of the chores that I don't).", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578529609045, "text": "Thanks for the review Miles!

I'm so glad I gave this place a try. In the very first visit I could see the difference. After a few weeks I felt like a new person. I originally only came here because I had just moved to Decatur and driving to my old chiropractor was getting to be a hassle. On my first visit Dr. Mann discussed new treatment methods that he had seen some success with and I decided to give the rehab a try before just going to my regular Wellness treatments. Like I said in just a couple weeks I could see the changes. I used 2 feel tingling from my back almost weekly. I now haven't felt it in weeks. I used to have to avoid certain Hobbies that I enjoyed because I was afraid my back would go out. Thanks to Doctor Mann I now have no fear of my back going out on me. That in itself is huge for me!

The office was nice. Front desk was helpful. Dr. Mann was very  professional and gave me the same level of treatment I was used to getting in back in Tennessee.

I really thought I got it from my dad but Dr. Mann said a lot of it has to do with lifestyle as well.  I had great results here.  Instant relief, followed by weeks of improvement.  Visits never took that long- barely sat in the waiting room before me treatment begins and I was moved to the next parts of my treatment were with little to no wait.  At the end I did have a few question but Dr. Mann stayed with me to answer my questions.  Nothing beats being able to sleep, wake up, go through a demanding day, and still feel great every day.

My son's basketball season started up which means lots of driving and uncomfortable locations I must linger in for hours, multiple nights a week.  With the instructions Dr. Mann gave me my back has held up and I have not missed a second of a single game.  They were able to work me in this morning for an adjustment before I hit the road for the holidays.  Dr. Mann even came out to my car to help me setup me seat cushion to keep my back from acting up on the long drive we have to my wife's family gathering in North Carolina.  I cannot say enough about how happy I am that I found Dr. Mann's office.   Until next time! Thanks again you guys!

Attempted to realign a part of my body that didn't need it and when he was done after 6 minutes in the room with me he managed to not fix the issue at all now I'm out over $100.00 and absolutely  no relief for a simple pinched nerve, oh but he did set me up on the \"maintenance plan\" which is 3 visits a week at $65 per visit that's $780 a month! That's more then my mortgage for what every single other chiropractor has been able to fix and treat in one visit for under $50.00. Please be wise and heed this as a warning. I do not recommend this place for anyone. They may be a legal D.C. but it's as close to a scam ad you can get legally.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546567115350, "text": "Kris- you are being dishonest. Health expenses without insurance can be tough, but that is no excuse for your dishonesty in your review. Cameras show your time in the office was approximately 40 minutes; less than 5 minutes in the waiting room- standard for any first visit. Furthermore, we offer the lowest cash prices for new patients in town and also very flexible payment plans.  You were told the prices before you came in. Our cameras even show you were in high spirits until it was time to pay your bill.  And instead of talking to us and working out a payment plan we watched you go into your car and leave this angry review.  Also, what you tried to tell us was \u2018wrong\u2019 with you was actually incorrect and probably the main reason you\u2019ve had to deal with your back pain for years instead of actullay being \u2018fixed.\u2019 While we have great respect for you and your field, you have to remember- you are not a doctor-  for instance a chiropractor in a car accident should heed the EMT\u2019s instructions because that is what they have been trained to do.  You are also confusing your terminology- maintenance is for wellness patients- and is an optional once a month visit for those who have complete their \u2018rehab\u2019 plan to help stay ahead of injuries and reduce wear and tear on the body. Rehab plans are what you were trying to quote. Certain injuries take time to heal and a proper plan for recovery. You are absolutely right Kris- We do things different at Advanced Chiropractic.  We get so many patients who have seen chiropractors that take shortcuts to treat their injuries and the patient continues to deal with pain for years.  Our goal at Advanced Chiropractic is to HEAL the injury. We have found that if we simply make pain go away we are no different than a pain killer or opiate.  However, with our custom made rehabilitation plans you can escape that continued damage, year after year, which is so important as many parts of the body don\u2019t grow back when you repeatedly injure them."}, "gmap_id": "0x886284764f6fef61:0x2058cd07a41eab07"}

It's amazing how quickly your body can change and improve. I had no endurance in the beginning but was completing the maximum effort by the end of the challenge. One of the best things about the program is that everyone is in it together.  We were all eating the same foods, sharing recipe ideas, figuring out the exercises and encouraging one another.

It may not be food you want but it doesn\u2019t have to be horrible plus they give you some awesome recipes. I made some precious friends along the way, that always held me accountable and kept me encouraged. All the trainers truly WANT you to succeed! If you just make the choice to work hard and eat clean YOU WILL see results. I highly recommended anyone who wants to lose weight, feel better or live a healthy lifestyle to join squad. Even with the challenge ending I\u2019ll be joining squad fitness as a member because it\u2019s that addicting and life changing!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903eb52f00f0d:0x907eeff3156e5c7b"}

Honestly without the deposit I would have never had the results I had. I was truly amazed that I was able to go workout 4 days a week and do it to that level of intensity. The trainers, Heather and Zack, are truly amazing people. It was truly a pleasure to be around them. I also met a lot of amazing people and we worked out as team and became friends along the way. This experience went much much better than I ever thought it could have and that's all because of Zack and Heather and all the other amazing challengers giving it their all every week.  I learned self control with my eating following the meal plan they give you and that I actually do have time to exercised 4-5 times per week. Also my stamina increased so fast. I went from a couch potato to running 3 - 3.5 miles in 3 weeks. I ran one day week and did the challenge 4 days a week just to make sure I made my goal and got my deposit back.

There is ALWAYS someone there to encourage you, push you, and support you when it's needed. Coaches and members always push you when you need it the most.

I can't thank heather, josh, and Aidan enough because they always push you and they WANT to see you do good. I was so excited when the 6 weeks was wrapping up because I could tell a change in myself- mentally and physically. If it wasn't for Squad, there is no telling where I would be.

When I first started, I was unsure of how well I would be able to complete the Challenge with my work schedule and my childcare. I also really like to eat, so I was worried about that too. For every excuse I could throw out, Romen had a solution to offer. I used to run a good bit before my second child was born, and I had not gotten back into shape since his birth (he's two and a half). Months and months of running didn't do for my body what the Camp Challenge did in six weeks. It's the 20lb in 6 week program, not the 6lb in 20 week program! The workouts are hard, but never boring, always challenging, and (I kinda want to say fun). If there's a part that you hate, you know it's gonna be over soon. Even though it's hard, you get stronger quickly and I find myself wanting more at the end of the hour. It makes it easier to go back the next day and I miss it when I can't make my workout. At week one, I was doing pushups on my knees and couldn't do a burpee. In week 6, I'm doing of pushups on my toes (with good form) and I can burpee and wall sit with the best of them. The trainers are encouraging and push me to do more than I think I can, which is exactly what I need to get stronger and in better shape. I lost two dress sizes, and feel FREE to put on anything in my closet because I don't have to be self-conscious anymore. I didn't hate trying on swimsuits last week, and actually bought three because they all looked good and I couldn't decide. THAT is a victory in and of itself! The diet isn't bad at all if you like veggies, and I virtually stopped having headaches (which I'm guessing were related to my sugar consumption). It takes planning and prepping, but it's totally do-able, and it made me get creative in the kitchen. And if cooking and prep are not your thing, they even have a meal service that you can purchase too! NO Excuses! You get support all the way. I joined the gym at the end of my challenge because it's a positive, self-care habit in my life now, and I can't do without it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903eb52f00f0d:0x907eeff3156e5c7b"}

When I was doubtful, she was always there to encourage me, being honest with me about the challenges I would face, yet reassuring me that I would one day be able to return to a life filled with many athletic endeavors.  Abbey is understanding and genuinely takes a personal interest in how you're feeling.  She always made sure to explain every exercise in depth and also how it would aid in my progress going forward.  I feel lucky to have been guided by Abbey along my PT journey, for it was her encouragement that pushed me through when I was at my lowest.\nHannah is also extremely helpful and efficient.  Being the face you see when you first walk in, she is cheerful and always greets the patients by name.  TherapySouth has an amazing team and, more importantly, great teamwork.  It is modern and very nice, clean, and an extremely well-run practice.  I couldn't be happier with my experience with something I wasn't at all looking forward to.\nThank you to the TherapySouth team for always answering my questions with interest and patience.  You guys have truly made my recovery a more pleasant experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533157199314, "text": "Thank you so much for your kind words Ashley!

Master Scarsella and his team are very nice and will help you, they offer a free 3 day class and they'll let you try out if you dicide if you want to join taekwondo. They also have events every month like taekwondo championships and movie night. I been both of them and is really fun. Children can go to movie nights without their parents but the instructors will supervise them and is really fun. The championship is for all ages and for all belts. They take place in a school other than theirs because it is small. They are socially distant and if you don't feel safe doing in person, you can do taekwondo in home on zoom. Can't give the zoom code meeting for reasons but if you join, they will tell you the meeting code and instructions.

I was impressed with his knowledge and ability in the area of health and fitness. Elliott is all about community. He's played a huge role in helping me establish my non-profit, Scarlett's Closet . He's even a member of my board.\nLast year, after attending one of the fundraisers Live Ready hosts for us annually, I saw pictures of myself at the event and realized I needed to take control of my life and be the healthiest version of Lisa I can be. I started doing workouts in my home and making better food choices. By May of this year, I'd lost 41Lbs, but the scales had stopped moving. I reached out to Elliott and he told me I was most likely in a calorie deficit.  I recall my response; I laughed at him. He encouraged me to sign up for  a \"Love to Eat Challenge\" Through this challenge, I was taught what to eat and how my plate should look. I am happy to report that I won the challenge and to date, I have lost 64lbs. I am wearing the smallest clothes I've ever worn as an adult. I recently had surgery and  Elliott has asked me to start training with him once my Doctor clears me to do so.  In the past, I would have said, \"No way.\" Now, I have the confidence I need to accept the challenge.\nIf you are looking to make positive changes in your life, I urge you to contact Elliott and his team. They are not only the best at what they do, but some of the nicest and most encouraging people you will ever meet. You won't feel pressured or intimidated. I am grateful for all their help and encouragement. I've never felt better. Isn't it time you took the first step to a healthier you? call them today!\nLisa P.

That's $1440 for a year. I think what turned me away was the amount of willingness to work with folks like myself, whom are rarely here due to work. It was pretty clear that $120 was the price and nothing less than military orders would change that. Even then the offer sounded less than ideal. So, that's the business side.\n\nThe workout side of this facility seemed... Alright. The facility was great as were the staff and customer personalities and support. Going back to the money, I definitely don't believe the training I saw warranted the price. I saw more flexion in lower back than I care to see-not just from young/new members. My fear of CrossFit gyms is always seeing atrocious form, and although that wasn't the case here (form wasn't... Terrible...) It still wasn't good enough for the hefty price. I could get a personal coach for the same and get precise, individual training for less money and same or better quality.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507482201039, "text": "We are so sorry to hear that you do not agree with the price we charge.

We also realize that people\u2019s form are less then perfect but everyone comes in moving different, with different mobility problems and different degrees of fitness and athleticism.

Competition is friendly, but it is real. You do not want to be the slowest or weakest person, so you will push yourself to do better. All the members are encouraging to each other.

Working out is fun again. I see results again. This place turns into your home away from home. The members turn into family. The coaching and programming are top notch. It doesn't get any better. You will not regret dropping in for a class. There are all ages and fitness levels in every class.

If you feel like challenging yourself, go for it. Joe will give you different levels to try for each exercise. He's awesome and very supportive. You will be supported by everyone there.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581703922159, "text": "Thank you so much! You nailed a lot of the things I hold near and dear to my heart about boot camp.

I couldn't do one ONE push-up when I started, and he never made me feel like I was \"behind\" the rest of the class.  He is always super supportive and has a wealth of knowledge and ways to modify exercises to your skill level.  Newbies train next to serious exercisers, and everybody feels like they are part of his tribe.  His wife and his mom both come to some of the classes too, and that makes it a cool family vibe.  He plays great music and he is always super positive.  In addition, he lets us know about local exercise events and we have the opportunity to be part of his team, helping the community, i.e. the Liz Hurley 5K.  Everyone is welcome to join in.

I joined Premier in October 2012 with Oct-Dec free. I enrolled on the family plan with my 3 children. My children quickly became bored with the short 30 minute classes that they could only attend twice a week. The instructors were good with the kids, it was just the rushed format that was bad. By January only one was left attending. I wasn't any happier with the jujitsu, Krav Maga, or Muay Thai classes. All classes were only 30 minutes as well. This means practically no warm up, rushed instruction, and little to no time to practice technique or spar. To make it worse, because I had some experience in jujitsu ( my main area of interest when I joined) I was handed a book with the curriculum for the night and left to teach students who had attended Premier longer than me on several occasions. So not only was I losing my training time, I was left in an awkward situation. At this point I figured I would just deal with it and not renew my contract when the 6 months were up. In January the owner sold me on joining the Certified Instructor Training Program with promises of additional training outside of normal class times, seminars that would be paid for by my tuition, weekly CIT meetings, and eventually running my own school under the premier name. There were about 4-5 other adults that signed up for this as well. We changed my contract to reflect that my monthly payments would now go to paying the $10,000 tuition for this course. Between signing up in January till April there were only a total of 3 CIT meetings, far from the weekly meetings I was promised. There was no additional training offered. The seminars were all held in either Kentucky or Texas so to attend you had to drive there and get a hotel. That's not so bad I suppose, but then I was told that there would be an additional fee of several hundred dollars to attend. Also I would have to buy all the equipment required for the seminars (which had to be Premier brand). To purchase all of this equipment added approximately $400 (that's with the CIT discount). By March I had come to accept I had been suckered into a joining a McDojo and was now stuck in a contract. I was going to make the most of it. A month or so later the lead instructor came to teach class intoxicated. To the point he was slurring and falling asleep mid sentence while sitting up. After attending the jujitsu class he taught, several of us informed the owner of the instructors condition. He allowed him to continue teaching the remaining classes (Krav Maga and Muay Thai) while he sat in the back and watched. After this I told the instructor that I wanted to cancel my contract. I expressed all of my concerns and disappointments. He assured me that he was going to improve everything and make good on his promises. He asked me to give him another chance and a little time to get things the way they should be. 2 months later the only thing that had changed was that he fired the instructor that was intoxicatedd. There were only 2 CITs left, including me. Everyone else quit showing up. I informed the owner via E-mail, multiple voicemails, and Facebook messenger that I was dropping out. I listed all of the reasons and was very polite. I received no response. I also contacted the billing company, Member Solutions, as per my contract, to cancel. I explained my multiple reasons for wanting to cancel, and they informed me that I could not cancel. The new contract I signed for the CIT program was counted as a loan for $10,000 that I had to pay back before I could cancel. I attempted again, multiple times, to contact the owner about this issue and once again received no response. I am fortunate enough to have a lawyer as a friend to help me beat this scam. However, I would strongly recommend you stay away from this \"school\".\n\nSincerely,\nChris Allen", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889720dd9ebefeb:0x8c472225533f0464"}

Being an active person who likes to hike and lives on a farm, I immediately went to the doctor and was referred for physical therapy. It didn't help at all. Over the last five years, I have tried different doctors who have referred me to different physical therapists, with no change in pain level.\nAt my last doctor's appointment, my primary doctor asked if anything was bothering me and I told him I still had plantar fasciitis. We talked through my experience and he suggested I try a different podiatrist, Dr. Stark. Dr. Stark immediately referred me to Therapy South and asked that I see Robert Harris. I went to the appointment not expecting any different outcome but I am so glad I went! Robert was encouraging, saying he had a plan and he felt confident he could help me. We started with therapy three times a week, addressing first the plantar problem but then working backward to involve the parts of the leg and hip that caused the injury in the first place. Robert gave me four exercises to do twice daily at home and I logged exercise sessions through an easy to use app. Each appointment has been a teaching experience. Robert asks how I'm doing, I tell him how I'm progressing or having problems and he immediately explains and teaches me a stretch or exercise that will help. Robert's goal is to teach me strategies to address problems independently in the future. Each week finds me feeling better, my plantar fasciitis pain now almost completely gone.

Nine months later, I am able to do most activities that I want/need/love to do without ANY pain and I have gained muscle strength and flexibility that I so desperately needed.\n\nI really don't know what I would have done without the physical therapists Robert and Emily, their interns, and the wonderful staff at TherapySouth-Auburn.

A year and a half ago, I could no longer live with my shoulder pain, both sides due to torn rotator cuffs.  My orthopedist said surgery was likely the only way to successfully heal.  I did not want that and asked for a PT referral.  I began therapy at TherapySouth in January 2018 and was surprised at how thorough and caring the folks were.  I was asked detailed questions throughout my initial evaluation and follow-up questions during each exercise.  Robert and Dreher would adjust exercises according to my limits and evaluate my ongoing recovery at each session.  By April, I had almost full motion in my arms/shoulders, pain was gone, and I even could reach around back to scratch my shoulder blades!  All without any NSAIDS or other drugs.\n\nSo when I began having elbow pain this year, I asked my doctor for a referral to TherapySouth.  Once again a thorough evaluation of my pain and its source was done by Robert.  By the second session I was already experiencing significant relief from pain that was serious enough to keep me awake at night.  And no drugs!  During my last session, I menbtioned that I also suffered from occipital neuralgia.  Robert did not seem surprised and showed me how complex the relationship with all the tendons, muscles, etc in the back and neck can end up causing pain and trigger points.  Here I am two days later with reduced pain throughout my neck, back, shoulders.\n\nIf you are injured, TherapySouth is the place to go for Physical Therapy.  I've literally been to dozens of therapists over a lifetime.  No one comes close to these folks.  If I could give them 10 stars instead of 5 I would do that.

Very clean and with new modern equipment from Precor, TechnoGym and FreeMotion. The track is really cool for running instead of boring treadmills. I did a few \"sessions\" with trainer Kyle White and he definitely knows how to give you a good work out, you won't be disappointed. The two of us have a pretty regular thing going on now. The location is convenient but it can get pretty busy after work. I would suggest if you can try and go later in the evening to avoid the crowds and get an appointment with Kyle then hit the sauna afterwards for some small talk and hot relaxation. There's no juice bar or anything like that but Mugshots is right up 31 and a great midway point to loosen up little bit before just going home and straight to bed. Kyle is also very skilled in deep tissue massage due to his strong grip and thick forearms, so if you are sore afterwards it's a good way jumpstart the recovery process and get you in the right mood.

No surprise as soon as you walk in the door and they find out you aren't a member they try and get you to sign a contract.  The are commission based and are forced to get a lot of memberships but could care less about you as a person.  I go to a gym now where the exact opposite is true.  Why do you think they make you sign a long contract.  Yeah their facilities are nice, but it won't take long to regret their overpriced rudeness and inexperienced sometimes ignorant physical trainers.  Physical trainers start out at Gold's and the good ones leave because Golds takes a large cut of the top of their fees( not trainers fault)  BE WARNED!\n\nMy own story?\n\nI moved down to B'ham about 2 years ago then had to return to Missouri when I canceled my membership in person with this location's manager, Mike Bick.  I came in and he assured me everything was good.  (Memberships can only be canceled if there's not a Gold's Gym location within a certain proximity of where you are moving, must show proof of move)  When I arrived in Missouri I faxed Bick a copy of my utility bill and called him to verify he got it.\n\nMonths later I moved back to B'ham and considered re-enrolling when I was shocked to find out they were still auto-billing my card and refused to refund me after I called several times and went to their accounting department.

Both were done by the same surgeon. My first surgery was in November of 2015. I did physical therapy at another Hoover clinic (not a therapy south) and I grew to hate physical therapy, physical therapists, anything associated with them. I honestly believed the profession was a crock because of the poor care I had received at that clinic. I didn\u2019t know any better! My hip never got better, it was much weaker than before, and three years later, is still in pain and lacking the function I had prior. My skepticism towards physical therapy as it turns out, was just because I went to the wrong place. After a shoulder surgery in May of 2016, I was referred to Chris and Corey from a friend and my outlook could not be more different now. Not only did they cater my shoulder rehab to my specific sport (weightlifting), they also helped me repair my hip and alleviate some of my pain. I\u2019m a true believer in physical therapy now, even going as far as changing my career path so I can also change someone\u2019s outlook.

If you've never been to an Orangetheory class, I can explain it simply - in my own words, it's a 60 minute 5 zone heart rate based group personal training session that includes cardio and weights. I've never been much into cardio but the class provides you ways of doing cardio through walking, jogging or running - you choose. I LOVED that! I really like the group exercise classes, because they always make me push harder than I would on my own. In addition to that the use of heart rate monitoring is unique and something that enabled me to track my performance and challenge myself...which I really enjoyed.\n\nOverall I would def recommend this place to anyone.
