I was told appointment would be with  Dr. Pflederer, June 15 when I scheduled. I researched her. and was pleased.  She isn't even on site anymore.   I haven't been checked in 10+ years, I am 61 and spent many younger years basking in the sun. I have several places on my skin I've been concerned about, I don't know what to look for  and many of my friends have had skin cancer. I expressed my concerns when I scheduled my appt.  My complete exam was a NP, her appts are scheduled every 10 mins. No doc. I never was on exam table, she didn't look at my face, I didn't take glasses off. She was in a hurry, I ask for places to be removed. I was afraid of them being frozen off.  She said that that is all they could do and she wasn't sure ins covered it. I ask if they could call to check insurance, the reply was, \"I don't think so\"  I was charged for Office Visit $130 - $86.25 to freeze 3 places that are still there. $130 for 10 min exam. My dog gets more attention at his vet visits for $52.50.  If you want a complete exam, and I stressed that when I called,  I do not recommend this practice.  10 mins for a complete body exam, a nurse running out the door for her next patient, no info on what to check or look for and though insurance did pay for visit I am out $32.24.and I feel I need to be checked again. I will check with Fed BCBS to see exactly what kind of office visit I was suppose to get, code for time seen .....Not happy and will find a dermatologist practice that will act somewhat concerned and look out for my future health.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c0d280c0989:0x895d61d7dff14ede"}

Patient health and well-being is of top priority for us. Choosing prescription medications is a difficult job that doctors train years to master. Unfortunately, each patient has a specific insurance plan, with varying degrees of drug coverage. Knowing each patient\u2019s insurance drug coverage is impossible, so our providers tell every patient to contact us if the prescribed medications aren\u2019t covered well by their insurance plan and turn out to be too costly. This gives our providers the opportunity to come up with a new prescription plan that is less costly but still effective to treat you. We strive every day to give our patients the best treatment at the best possible price. If you\u2019re up for it, we would love to speak with you on the phone about how the prescription process works on our end. Please contact us at 205.995.5575 and we will be happy to talk through your concerns. We hope to talk to you soon!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889175c2e9af3b1:0x456ad1bffd44b297"}

I would not recommend this clinic to anyone. I had tried contacting the office for a week to have a prescription filled with no response. My pharmacy called and told me they too could not get a response from the clinic either. I emailed yesterday to state how ridiculous I thought it was for there to be this little communication with patients, especially ones that need a prescription refilled. To my disbelief I received a personal phone call from Dr. Sawyer herself on a Saturday at 3:00 only to call me out for the email I sent, because the email I sent said \u201cridiculous\u201d in it. She called me rude many times and then stated i would no longer be a patient of DLA. Dr Sawyer then went on to tell me that the entire DLA staff had, had  many negative discussions about me in the past. I have been left confused, as when I asked for how I have ever been rude to anyone at DLA she hung up on me. I can assure you, that this was a mistake on the entire DLA staff and Dr. Sawyer, as she spoke to me as I was a completely different person then who she thought she was speaking too. After that very disturbing and unprofessional phone call, I am thankful to move to a different clinic. I can not fathom a physician directly calling and speaking to a patient in the manner Dr. Sawyer did, and going out of her way to do so on a Saturday afternoon just to tell me all this and without verifying my information before being aggressive towards me. She definitely was mistaken on who I was, but I will never return.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891984634d17c3:0x88b9f487866c1239"}

She was upfront and told me that it would likely not give me the results I was looking for (apparently red / black are pretty easy to get out but green / purple is more difficult). She saved me multiple sessions at $150/pop and a potentially worse situation than I am already in if all of the pigment was removed (leaving a totally white version of the tattoo).

Huntsville, Alabama, are offices that give the South a bad name besides some of the Southerner\u2019s unmerited allegiance with the Confederate flag that should remain forever buried. His office is indeed rude, nasty, racist and lack any reminisce to GOD. On top of that, Lon F. Raby Jr., and his office staff members are apparently not only hate criminals; but do not want certain groups of people to be allowed in his practice although by law he has little choice on the admittance of certain groups of people. He and his staff are unkempt, unintelligent and just plain ridiculous.\n\nNot only that, but he is too busy poking his nose in matters that don\u2019t concern him such as listening to lies his staff overpowers him with to see the light of day. His staff sits around gossiping, lying and hating all day. Although there are several of them conversing all at once, when a patient approaches the desk, they ignore them as though the patient is invisible. They all give a new meaning to the words nasty, mean, unintelligent and smelly.  Like Hugo Black a now deceased United States Supreme Court Justice, Lon F. Raby Jr., and most of his staff members including Mike Lee, Shelia, Megan and especially Ashley are likely affiliated with the k.k.k. Unlike Justice Black, however, Lon F. Raby Jr., and his staff don\u2019t even try to hide their hate for some and act as though the mere entrance into their office is a privilege that non-Caucasians should not be able to obtain.\n\nBesides that, Lon F. Raby Jr., is not a good doctor at all. He is uncaring, misinformed, rude and has the bed-side manner of a door-knob. He couldn\u2019t even remember one of his patients who at the age of 15, had cancer, claiming he has 35k patients. Regardless, a doctor who really cared, would forget such a young cancer patient. Right?\n\nHe apparently does not keep up with the latest medical advances and he seemingly knows very little about his profession. For example, he constantly misdiagnosed two of his patients and he makes health statements that are often without merit just like his nurse Shelia who had the uneducated audacity to say, \u201c\u2026 Blacks don\u2019t wash their hair everyday\u2026\u201d. What a terrible untruth to say and what a terrible poor excuse for a so-called medical office.  We wouldn't go back if they paid us good money. Don\u2019t waste your time, money or energy with these Billies of the hills.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621332f09f8fed:0x4fac60e33f447d1a"}

Who has that kind of time to conduct such an in depth study? I am impressed by your analysis. In fact, I am impressed you were able to have ascertained all that information in just one office visit. You really should seek employment with the CIA or NSA, they could use your analytical skills. However, I really do tend to think your opinion was based on several visits. But then why would you continue going back to such a terrible office after all those horrible experiences? There are plenty of Dermatology offices in this area and you could easily have become a new patient else where. But for some reason you didn't. So either you are that analytical whereby you were able to ascertain all those opinions in a short office visit or you just continued to endure these office visits and made your opinions after such. But you know what I really think and what your opinion and post communicates? You didn't get something for free or you didn't get it your way and expected rules and processes to be broken for your convenience and thereby you painted \"everyone\" that works in this office with a broad brush as being a racist. Which by the way is the common sounding bell heard throughout or nation nowadays when someone doesn't get there way and wants the rules broken for them. My advice to you is to be careful when posting in the future and accusing them of being associated with such hate groups of the KKK. You never know who you offended. It could be someone's dear wife you painted with your immature and spoiled brush. And that my dear or sir can be construed as slander and a civil matter that could cost you plenty. And by the way if you think I have a dog in the fight with this office you are sadly mistaken. It is your uneducated and offensive language that got my attention.  I recommend you begin expecting to play by the rules like everyone else and leave skin color and hate groups out of it. And if there is something you can't have or you desire to have then figure it out how to obtain it and not hold your hand out. By the way, how dare you call out folks in the name of God!  Can you please show me the scripture where a person can associate those that do not hand over what one demands with a hate group?  You might want to turn the flap of your bible to the left a little more often.

Her staff though is very sweet. I didn\u2019t get the medication she thought MIGHT help b/c it was pointless to purchase out of pocket if it MIGHT help. And the two reasons she said i might have skin discoloration was definitely not my case. I\u2019m big on reviews & she had a few reviews on her dry attitude but i gave her the benefit of the doubt because i had people who recommended her..obviously b/c she helped their condition & not off her attitude. She was so awkward & dry.

I didn't ask for sleep advice.\nI mean I could understand her saying the nursing could be irritating my issue and that weaning might be something to consider.\nBut talking about how my son doesn't need to nurse anymore and I should really just talk to his pediatrician about weaning him is way beyond her scope and none of her damn business!\nHis pediatrician has no problem with it and nursing till 2 is recommended by the WHO.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893e50dc905cab:0x5579fabd64bbb096"}

However, as I communicated to you in our conversation last night which you neglected to include in your response, I have waited for a return call to my non-urgent issue way longer than 24-48 hours. My first follow-up appointment where the biopsy was taken was on June 13th, where I was told by a clinician that I would know the results before I left for vacation. I called for results initially 1 or 2 days before I left town June 23rd. I then called back on the 28th, where I was told once again that I would be called back before close of business, yet I was not. I was never informed by any of your staff that I spoke with (both clinical and non-clinical - I have spoken with both) of the 10-14 day timeframe for biopsy results. In speaking with you last night is the first I have heard of the 10-14 day waiting period for results and the results not being discussed until the scheduled follow-up visit. Perhaps some form of training refresher would be useful in ensuring that all of the staff, both clinical and non-clinical are relaying uniform information and setting the proper expectations to the patients.

I am unbelievably relieved to have found such a dedicated and knowledgeable dermatologist in Dr. Ramagosa, currently serving the Mobile area.\n\nOver the past year and a half, I developed some type of acne/cyst/nodular skin issue. The complexities of this concern are daunting, but let\u2019s just say I had visited quite a few dermatologists between Birmingham and Mobile, with no relief. Honestly, I had almost given up all hope of finding a resolution.\n\nI was referred to Dr. Ramagosa via my newly acquired primary care physician (who is also amazing) through Alabama Medical Group.\nFrom the moment I entered the Sunrise Dermatology office building, I knew I was in good hands. The interior is beautifully decorated and tastefully modern. The attention to detail, in presentation and delivery, alerted me to the fact that these doctors understood the significance of aesthetics and the finesse required of them in their field.\n\nIn dealing with concerns like mine (those concerns clearly visible, mainly located on my face) it is important to me that the doctor not only address the immediate issue, but that he understands the end goal and formulates a plan with this outcome in mind.\n\nShortly after I explained some medical background regarding my skin, Dr. Ramagosa confidently assured me that he could help. He explained what he believed to be the case, discussed why this problem probably presented, and how we could rectify the situation.\n\nI just left my one month follow up with Dr. Ramagosa and I must say that the results thus far have been amazing, and I finally see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI am very thankful for the referral to Sunrise Dermatology, and appreciate Dr. Ramagosa and his staff.\n\nGo here!!! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd84", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d85525cf983:0x1c8a44c4c6b5db28"}

We went to this  dermatology office several times over several months and the problem just continued to get worse. I kept doing exactly what they said to do  (religiously, every day, and very carefully) and it wasn\u2019t helping. So I called Dr. Stewart\u2019s office and explained our situation. He said it was the worst case he\u2019d seen in a child and gave us our options. He told us he could laser them off that very day and she could leave his office that day without any more warts on her foot. This option was never given to us at the other office (probably bc we never got to see the actual derm- we always saw the nurse practitioner and i don\u2019t know if they are able to do the laser). Anyway, my daughter was so scared but his staff were all so kind and wonderful and helped her so much to be brave and feel comfortable. Dr. Stewart then did as promised and gave us good instructions on what we needed to do to care for it after we left. After that he followed up with me from his personal cell phone several times to make sure she was doing ok and to guide me through caring for her. He did a fantastic job and she no longer has to deal with the pain or embarrassment bc of him and his giving us other options than we\u2019d been given before.

The next year I went back and got him to remove excess fat around my ankles, knees and \"love handles\", another $3000 and then several trips to have saline injections in varicose veins.  I was pretty pleased with the results. Now, after a little over 20 years, I have a Huge hernia on my belly which 2 surgeons have assured me my insurance will not pay to fix because it is caused by previous damage to my stomach muscles that has allowed my stomach to sag through but not my intestines! Also, I have horrible huge purplish red areas around my ankles which my current dermatologist has assured me is lipodermatosclerosis. It is inflammation in the under-skin layer of fat. Not much to do about that either.\nI am really unhappy to have spent nearly $7000 only to have my body RUINED in the long run!!!

It's not obvious stuff to a layman.\n\nThere's no way to view your records online, bc even though they have a patient portal (app), no information is ever entered. I know the medicine I'm taking, but still don't know what condition I actually have, bc I never saw the actual results of the biopsy, and no one told me.\n\nThe biggest issue I had was trying to get the results of the biopsy (again, I still don't have them) I missed their initial call on a Friday. I called Monday, they missed it. They called back Monday 5 minutes before the office closed, I missed it again. The next two weeks (5 day weeks, not weekends), I called every day and left a message on why I was calling, no one called me back. I also sent several emails through the website \"contact us\" portal. After two weeks of no response, I sent a message to the corporate office on FACEBOOK explaining my situation and frustration. I recieved a call within the hour. The nurse said she \"tried to call me back and I didn't pick up\" but completely ignored my two weeks of messages.\nI was told the medicine I should be on.\nA few days later, they called and said I had to get blood work done before the prescription could be approved. Blood work that they knew needed to be done before approval. It should have been done at the biopsy appointment, when they were telling me my only 'real' option at this point was this specific medicine.\nBut again, they don't communicate effectively.\n\nThis specific prescription was called in at 2 different pharmacies, cancelled at both, and is now hopefully on it's way to me, with a hefty price tag still attached even after insurance.\n\nAlthough I'm aware that there are programs that exist to help me brace this monthly price, I don't know anything about them, because I've been given no information other than that they exist.\nSo a bill is headed my way, and I did what I could- left. another. message.\n\nThey're not the worst doctors I've had by far, but when the only way to actually get a response is to make an appointment or contact corporate, it really feels like there just trying to squeeze the money out of you and they don't really know/care what's going on.\nI don't know if my experience is the result of errors by the entire office, a few people, it even just one-  but so many things piled up have created quite a frustrating, long road- and I don't even know if I'm at the end of it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f42814803d1:0x42305fea09b68c48"}

I was on my way to the clinic 25 minutes post my appointment time.  I called on the way to inquire as to if they would still see me; the lady on the phone explains that after 15 minutes they require a reschedule.  I understand that this is a common rule; however, it reflects that this clinic does not put patient care at a top priority.\n\nI, myself, work side by side with specialists; we run a very busy clinic seeing about 150-200 patients a day in total.  If a patient happens to be running late\u2014whether it is 30 minutes, 1 hour, sometimes even hours should they happen to have been confused about their appointment time\u2014we ALWAYS do our absolute best to work them in. 9/10, if the doctor has not left the office, the patient will be seen regardless; I even once experienced my doctor turn around from his ride home to return to see a patient late in the afternoon.  Our appointments involve multiple tests that can take 1-2 hours per patient before they even see the doctor.\n\nMy assumption is that the staff and doctors at Dermatology Specialists are only worried about getting out by lunch time on Fridays... However, this is all a final matter of opinion in my case.  It leads me to believe that the staff at this clinic do not place patient care at top priority as I previously stated.  Things happen.  What if someone got pulled over and was consequently 20 minutes late? What if someone's child was fussy and uncooperative early in the morning? What if someone was simply stuck in traffic?\n\nIt just seems inhumane to expect a human being to wait another 2 months for a HEALTH CARE appointment that they've already waited a month and a half for an extra 15 minutes...  That alludes, to me, that they do not care about the true health of their patients or those seeking medical care; only money and their own time.\n\nAnd AGAIN, YES! I should have been able to make it on time but sometimes you are just unable.  I do not want to see any health care provider that does not office compassion and flexibility for care of his or her patients.  I see true, compassionate patient care every day.  This is not it.\n\nUPDATE: I was contacted by the call center director/supervisor explaining that proper protocol was not carried out by the young lady that I spoke with earlier this morning; she was very professional & kind. She apologized and rescheduled me for an appointment much sooner than 2 months away. Serita is her name, I believe. I hope I spelled that right! Great patient reset, I will say! Thank you Serita!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621011190315, "text": "Thank  you for bringing this to our attention. I assure you that compassionate patient care is a top priority.

I went in last year to see about  how much it would cost to have a tag mole removed that had been on my neck for as long as I can remember. I was upfront that I had a health share plan, not insurance and that it wasn't covered. I asked Sydney Givens how much it would cost in all before I agreed to move forward. She came back into the room and told me $200 would cover the visit, removal and lab. I made a payment before I left. However when I received by bill. I was charged $150 for the office visit. $198 for the removal and $108 for lab. Then they tacked on an unnecessary second opinion charge 2 weeks later. They wound up filing the share plan anyway and discounted some and did remove the second charge, but I was still left with a bill of over $300. I tried multiple times to call and ask for them to adjust the charge to what I was told. It takes forever for them to return a call if they do and when they actually return the call I get put off. I physically go there and try to get some results and I'm told that only the provider can make the adjustments. I leave a written message for her to contact me months ago and have yet to hear from her. All I wanted was for them to go by their word and do what they said they were going to do. I'm not unhappy about the results at all, but I do question the integrity of an office who won't stand by their word or return calls/messages or even offer an explanation or even an \"I'm sorry I didn't get the amount right, we can work something out.\"  I'm just ignored.

I called yet again, it was after the hurricane and this time they said all of them employee\u2019s were currently working from home and she could have one give me a call back. once again, I never received a call back. so finally I called again today, told the lady I was not getting off of the phone until it was taken care of. I was transferred 5 times, spoke with a girl named Mandy who informed me that only the manager can take care of refunds and yet again she\u2019s on vacation. she stated that she could see on my file that the manager was suppose to be reviewing my refund over 6 months ago, but it still hasn\u2019t been taken care of. this manager, Marie Davidson, has put off sending me my refund just hoping I guess I would forget about it. Mandy said she would be back in office on January the 3rd.

But the nurse who welcomed me in apologized for that and said it\u2019s not normal. Then I had a little incident with my baby who was with me and everyone was so kind and understanding and helpful! And then the main reason I was there was for my acne and the doctor prescribed me things that were safe while breastfeeding. She explained what was going on, too. I\u2019m about 2 weeks in with her suggestions and my skin has significantly improved. I will definitely continue to come here for my skin health needs.\n\nUpdate: I have been to this location 3 times now and each time I have had an hour + wait. So the first time was not an isolated experience. Today is July 13th, 2020. Jefferson county has put a message out saying masks are required to help stop the spread until there is a vaccine. Unfortunately, this location is subject to this \u201crequirement\u201d and after asking if I had to even with the recent announcement that the WHO has come out and said in a press conference that \u201cit is rare for an asymptomatic person to spread COVID. \u201c So now we are in an era where counties and the businesses in them will pander to fear that is unfounded as of today with the death rate of Covid well below 1%. We will see what the future holds for Covid. If it mutates into a more dangerous strand, I will re-assess my frustration with businesses like this. But in the mean time, I will speak my mind and spread truth about what Covid is. I\u2019m sick and tired of being forced to wear a mask that will spike my carbon dioxide intake that has been proven to lower my immune system along with many other side effects. And all in the name of waiting for a vaccine that will still not have a long term trial study under its belt to make sure that there are not any severe long term side effects. And in case you are not aware, there are plenty of vaccines that have side effects that do not show up right away. One example of this is thimerosal (Mercury) was removed or reduced from vaccine use. Heck, Johnson and Johnson just settled with plaintiffs who experienced many different cancers decades after the use of JJ baby powder. BABY POWDER!! So I have serious concern with an inoculation that will most likely be required, like the masks are, to \u201cstop the spread\u201d (of a disease that is recording low death rates) that will not have long term testing to make sure that we aren\u2019t doing more harm than good. But that\u2019s my two cents.  I will most likely end up moving my derm needs to an office that not only can figure out how to not have hour waits for their patients but is brave enough to look the stats and facts in the face and take a stand against the current overstep we are seeing all over the country.\n\nAll in all, the people here are very kind, and the doctor I\u2019ve been seeing seriously helped with my adult acne. So  I will give them 4 stars. I recongize it\u2019s hard to stand against the grain. But the hour plus waits have been very hard since I bring my infant with me to these appointments.\n\nLastly, they also require hand sanitizer and temp check. These are things that do not bother me personally, and I still complied with all that was asked of me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aacce729c9:0x135bb203d88babc6"}

I still have problems\nwith my ear from time to time was the reason I made the 2nd appointment \u2013 fast forward to May 2018 and I called and made an appointment with her Nurse Practitioner& was told when I called in that I had a balance from 2016 that would have to be paid \u2013 Im not sure about their billing department but I didn\u2019t know about the balance & I told her that I would pay it. If I had known about a past due  and call to make an appointment is that someone that is trying not to pay? So we made the appointment went in today 6/7 my appointment was at 11:00 I get to my appointment she collects my co-pay I go sit down and she calls me back to the front desk and proceeds to tell me that she collected the co-pay not realizing there was the balance due and I would need to pay or I\ncouldnt go thru with my  appointment. I told her I couldn\u2019t pay it all today \u2013 that I could pay it tomorrow and she said she would have to speak with someone in billing \u2013 so this other young lady  comes out and says basically the same thing the other one  did with the exception -she said that someone had called me and left a voice mail for me & did I not get the voice mail? & on that VW stated I had to pay this. Which I said no  & I told her the same thing  - I get paid tomorrow and I would pay it then -  she says I couldn\u2019t keep the appointment if I didn\u2019t pay today. So I had to leave.   This review is not about whether I got to keep my appointment or not, its not about the balance I owe, its about how people are treated, all this was handled out at the front desk instead of asking me to step to the side, step into the 2nd  young ladies office , or go stand out front and wait for the police to arrive to hand cuff me is the way I felt  Just as the 1st appointment  was not good , my 2nd time there was even worse. I was so humiliated that other people could hear what was going on. I owe the money - but I would rather other people not know that I owe that money. I wish I would have paid more attention to the girls names, but I do remember faces. I had not intentions of not paying the balance due.\n\nMy cousin goes to Dr. Groysman - he has all great things to say about her as a Doctor & as a person. He thinks very highly of her & her practice. He is the reason I made the 2nd appointment -he said I should try again.\nMy cousin's name is Don Amick. He was also surprised that I couldn't keep my appointment today. BTW they took my co-pay and took it off my past due amount. My balance was 125.00 and not I only owe 95.00. That's right 95.00 not 200.00, not 300.00, not 500.00. It was 125.00. I've never written a review, while I know this is a long review - I just couldn't let this go. I felt this was just wrong the way I was humiliated in front of everyone Oh and I had to walk all the way back to my seat get my purse and then back in front of them again as they were watching me leave.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aacce729c9:0x135bb203d88babc6"}

She personally promised my daughter it would get better with another prescriptions.... you can imagine what it means for a teenager! Several months later still no change. I felt like my daughter was a Guinie pig! So the last resort was Accutane and after a week my daughter could not move or get out of bed that's how poisonous it was. We stopped it immediately and I took her to another Dr who diagnosed her w policystic ovaries... all she needed was a simple blood test. her face is a lot better now. I don't know how much harm all the meds she took for months did to her body. I'm just furious that nobody even suggested a blood test, they just treated the face, not the whole body.
