I've been here for 6 months now.  The first few weeks, I came here to eat several times but each time it just kept getting worse.  Now, it's almost the last place I'll go and eat at.\nThere were times when I walk up to order, only one ordering, and it's like I'm not there.  They keep talking to each other, though they saw me walk up.  It's like they have to finish up on talking about their lives or other people and then they can help you.  it's my lunch break...I don't have time for you guys to finish.  I need my food so I can go back to work.\nAlso, when they cut up my steak, then cut up someone else's raw chicken, then go back to fixing up my steak...I'm pretty sure that's a health violation and dangerous.  They preach that you never cross contaminate but these folks do.  I just pray that the spatula they are using is super hot and kills the salmonella.\nAlso, if I get the special fries that come with ranch on it...I don't need 80% ranch, and 10% fries.  I like ranch on my fries but not drowning in ranch so much it comes out of the to go carrier box.  Then I have to toss them in the garbage.\nThe folks here need real management or a better supervisor.  Cause at the moment, I know myself and others where I work, will not go back.  Places like this need to get away with hooking friends and family up.  That's all I see on Ft Rucker and probably why most things go down hill.

The establishment is nice , and the cashier was friendly. Their CC processor froze while I paid so I had to wait about 10 minutes to pay. The food took about 25 minutes , compared to other locations taking 6-9 minutes. Food wise it\u2019s the same as any other location so the consistency is there.
