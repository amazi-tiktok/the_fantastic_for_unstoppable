I felt that this was something I wanted to share with everyone who is looking to buy a mattress.\nWhen I buy a mattress it\u2019s like buying a car, my wife and I went to 4 stores, one of them had aggressive sales pitch tactics, this may be why they have the word \u201cFIRM\u201d in their name.\nAnyways, I was talking with the guys at the fire station and they started to rave about the mattresses they had slept on at another fire station. They said they would do business with The sleep center when it came time to buy for there home. So since this owner took care of my friends I decided I would check them out. When we walked in the door the manager met us with a hello from the back of the store, he saw that we had two kids and asked if we cared if they played in a children\u2019s area (Automatically we were less stressed) so while the kids played he asked the standard questions and then directed us to three types to choose from but then something amazing happened.... he left us alone! Lol, me an my wife were able to lay on each bed and were able to be honest with ourselves  about the comfort and the cost. At one point we were worried because we didn\u2019t hear our kids yelling like usually, well that\u2019s because the manager was keeping them entertained. The whole process took about 1 hour which is mainly because we couldn\u2019t decide which bed to buy. They were able to give us the best offer we have found out of all four stores and then even added some incentives! Do yourself a favor!! GO HERE FIRST, I promise you, you are wasting your time if you go anywhere else.\nP.S. Thank you for taking care of first responders, that goes a long way, now I just have to talk my Chief in replacing my mattress at the fire station!

Everything they carry is nothing but highly quality name brand product.  The store manager, Michael, is one of the friendliest, and probably one of the most honest persons, you will ever meet.\n\nAfter losing all my belongings in a fire, I decided to replace my Sofa Bed with a Futon, but knew nothing about them except for what I could find on the Internet, and had lots of questions.  I searched the Internet for places to buy, and right away noticed the Sleep Center with 30 Five-Star reviews, so off I went with over a dozen question in my head.\n\nWhen I entered the store, Michael was speaking with a customer on his cell, and upon seeing me asked the customer if he could greet me.  After we shook hands I told him to go back to his earlier customer, as I often deal with customers.  Once he was finished with his earlier customer I explained my predicament \u2014 he even remembered hearing about the fire.\n\nI told him what I had read online about Futons, and told every question I had, one at a time, which he answered, explained, showed and demonstrated one by one.  He never mentioned the word \"sell\", \"buy\" or \"purchase\" once.  The more questions I asked, the more he answered, explained, showed and demonstrated, as cheerful as when we fist said hello.  When I asked about the \"anti-slip pad\" that all internet articles said was a must for the mattress, he told me that it's true, but that they are nothing more than urethane foam anti-slip drawer liners available anywhere.  When I asked if he was serious, he lifted every Futon mattress they have on display to show me that that is all they use themselves.\n\nBeing an avid Geocacher, I asked Michael if he was.  He said he never heard of it, but could I explain it.  I always do one better by showing how the app works (and even the quickie online YouTube video), and point out nearby Geocaches on the app's map.  Mobile may now have new \"Cacher\" in the game.\n\nBack on track.  I bought my Futon right there on the spot.  When it was the day of delivery, their truck driver called me up exactly when they said he would, told me he was nearly loaded, and would be over in 20 minutes.  18 minutes later they were knocking on my door, two minutes ahead of the promised time from earlier in the week. 15 minutes minutes later, maybe less, I had a fully assembled Futon in my living room., without a scrap of paper or cardboard anywhere.  A perfectly professional and quality operation, from start to finish.\n\nI now need to replace my master bedroom bed, and I will be going straight back here.   I have no need to even visit anyplace else.\n\nThe bottom of all this:  if you need to buy a Bed, Futon, Mattress, or the like, or simply have questions about such, this is the place to go first.  You will be patronizing local, and patronizing family owned, and you'll never have to give it a second thought.

I had also paid an additional $75 for mattress to be safely delivered in a van or enclosed box truck; instead, mattress and mismatched box springs were delivered squashed inside the open back of an unmarked regular size pickup truck... and delivered five hours late.
